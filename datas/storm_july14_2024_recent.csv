"Their exact words were ""CenterPoint now expects to have 1 million impacted customers restored by the end of the day on Wednesday, July 10."""
Since over 2 million of their customers lost power that is less than half fixed by the end of the 10th.
"I feel you dawg! I’m going to start saving at least $5,000 yearly to evacuate to another state. Losing power is one of my biggest pet peeves"
I'm looking to move soon.  One sneeze and the power is out for a week.  Lose all groceries AGAIN.  4TH Largest city in America with the power grid of a 3rd world country.  It's embarrassing at this point.  I'm over it.
Where the hell are all of our taxes dollars going? We voted for increased tax for flood mitigation years ago… nothing. Taxes and higher power rates to improve our electric grid and infrastructure… nothing. 
We are paying the money to fix the issues and nothing is being done.
"Born and raised in Houston, but I left after Harvey. These floods and hurricanes are gonna keep happening more and more frequently until it's just another summer day."
"There's a certain cultural apathy in Houston that I really fucking hate, even though it's partially a consequence of a laid-back attitude that I love. It impacts a lot of areas of life, and we really pay for it at times like this. I keep hoping for more civic engagement, more *community*, but I just don't know."
I feel the same way. Been here about 15 years now and its just getting worse.
Houstonians feeling the exhaustion of being 'Houston strong' all the time.
"Thanks Abbott.Billions on the border ,all for show,but  refuses to fix the grid.All so his energy company co contributors can keep fleecing consumers in time of weather related calamity"
After living and loving this city for almost 50 yrs am done this time. WE are planning to move . Incredible a modern American city is so mishandled and the power companies so ill prepared. 
"Also there is absolutely NO WAy this city could be evacuated if need be, just look at constant everyday traffic...."
"I love Houston and I miss it, but this is the #1 reason we got the \*\*\*\* out!!  Lived there 16 years but after the freeze and multiple storms, we had enough!  I feel for everyone.. i bet there's more big storms on the way this year."
"The reality is that the rural voters outnumber the urban ones who care about these things. At a state level, the government just doesn’t care either, since they were voted in by people who want to stick it to the cities. It’s an interesting flex though, considering that Houston drives much of the Texas economy and every time we sneeze gas prices go up across the nation. But since the rich can leave whenever they’re inconvenienced and their rural base will still vote for them, why should they care?"
"Houston is just not a pleasant or well-managed place right now. Incompetent leadership and corporate greed, combined with climate change, has turned it into a third world country when storms come."
It's the same bullshit year after year. 
"State/county/city government/local utilities do the bare minimum to prepare; Disaster happens where people have to suffer in boiling heat, floods, or freeze;  Officials go on TV and suck each other's dicks about how hard everybody is working and come up with a catchy slogan; If anybody complains they are shouted down."
"When Texans stop voting Republicans into offices. Hard truth. If you're a conservative voter your values are unironically irrelevant because republican politicians have zero policy positions, they dont actually govern outside of ""muh tax cuts"" and all the other weird shit like getting Commandments and bibles in classrooms."
I haven’t seen any party with a decent plan to make infrastructure more climate resilient. It doesn’t have to be big and bold. Gimme competence and I’ll vote for it.
Republicans have become a joke.
"I’m only here because of family members I help, if not, I would be gone from this STATE! Almost 30 years, I’m beyond fucking tired and these storms are going to get more frequent and more intense. This city and infrastructure is not even being close to being ready. People can keep moving here in droves, I’m out of here the first chance I can leave, I’m tired. I’ve been saving money up for years to make sure I do it right."
I understand all the hate Houston gets from other Texas cities. We are so fucking primitive. I'm sick of it.
"The last 4 disasters, maybe more, that I can remember, there were always 1M+ people who didn't have power.  We are batting 1,000 at the moment.  "
"Comes November, vote all the incumbents out.  Don't care about which political party."
"While our loser corporate monkey governor is in Asia, I love our city, hate our stupid government. Centerpoint is a freaking mafia that just cares about money and theres nothing we can do bc the idiots in small towns only care about ""conservative values"" and keeping Texas red, while Abbott sits on his high horse with his scamming croney bald b\*tch(Ken Paxton). God I hate them all, they dont care about us!!! There are no down power lines but somehow half our complex doesn't have electricity and its damn near impossible to even get an update. I remember growing up and going through worse storms and it never was this big of an issue."
I adore Texas but our power grid is a joke. I’m honestly surprised there aren’t more riots at government offices
The State hates the City of Houston. Just look at the news. It’s as if the State punishes Houston and its citizens actively. I’ve never lived in a city where officials hate their own citizens. Why is it like this!?
I wonder if voters could make it illegal for power companies to have any charges on the bill other than usage charges.
They might change their mind about grid maintenance and durability if they are making no money when the power is out.
"Welcome to a deregulated energy market. Some regulation is a good thing. Enforcing that gas lines be properly winterized or that transmission towers are structurally sound enough to not be blown over by 50-60MPH winds are smart things that would stop a lot of issues like this. However, they cost money, and given the choice of spending money to cover edge cases or not spending money and YOLO'ing every time something like this happens, companies will choose saving the money every time. They have to be forced to do the right thing, so it's simply the cost of doing business."
When people start voting for it! As long as Republicans have total control of the state nothing is ever going to change… and in reality will probably continue to get worse.
"Narrator: ""it won't change"""
"When dumb fucks stop voting the good ol boys into office, it'll change."
People don’t want to admit it but this city is going downhill.
I am super excited to try out my new state insurance with the 2% deductible!!! I am positive my $5K a year homeowners insurance will come through for us and not increase next year! (Sarcasm)
"Big Bad Texas, huh?  Enough with the bravado.  I just got back from Mexico and weathered the CAT2 strength of Beryl and didn’t go more than 3 minutes without power.  This place is acting like it got hit with CAT9 Katrina+."
"What an embarrassment of a state.  A Canadien named Ted as our senator.  Third world country infrastructure across the state.  Don’t get me started on this state acting like it’s 1899.  Republican leadership for decades, and this is what we get and deserve.

"
"But by all means, let’s vote for Abbott for 20 more years.  Let’s get Trump back into the White House.  We have to be the dumbest smart people of the face of this Earth—until project 2025 privatizes education and it becomes a privilege to get a 3rd grade education."
If urban Harris county voters outnumbered rural votes along with texas in general voting further to the left we’d see change. However lived here many years my vote just get erased by a brain rotting voter who thinks voting to the left is voting for a communist or voting for the devil. Then the same conservatives who are in the pockets of center point and other energy companies just get voted in. Sad reality of Texas.
"It's coping. I just learned it's all fucking coping. The grind mindset, staying strong, denial. It's been around for a long time because there's no other way to keep going other than to cope. So we developed evolutionary complacency to accept instead of change."
"My area, zero elec, zero internet, and zero FUCKING CELL PHONE SERVICE!! I didn't even know that was a thing. I can't even make 911 calls. It's BULLSHIT how unprepared this city is."
"Almost feels like a 2nd world country with an unstable power grid and infrastructure.

"
"Why is there SO much backlash about building our infrastructure safer underground? You'll hear arguments ""but marshland and it's wet!"" yet other countries with nearly identical geography are doing it just fine."
"Downtown has electricity underground and they don't go out. Who's in those buildings during hurricanes anyway?

"
"We need another Governor, one who will hold ERCOT accountable. Abbott makes too many deals with the devil. He will put businesses ahead of his constituents every. single. time.  He needs to go, period."
"Blame Texas, not the city. Our state government is actively hostile towards progress or any kind."
"same. ive lived here for so long and its only getting worse... im ready to abandon ship. I love Houston i love its diversity and its food and its culture and arts scene, but the infrastructure is literally killing us.. its not just houston though.. its this whole damn state.."
Remember this when it is time to vote
"70+ mph wins are hardly a slight out of wack.  If you had driven around Houston just after, stuff all over the place was knocked over.   Traffic lights were smashed up all over just from getting peppered with debris."
"""Houston Strong"" (Because Texas didn't invest in infrastructure, insurance companies left, and doesn't believe in climate change, so now we're behind and fucked and have this slogan to make ourselves feel less stupid.)"
"My favorite response to all of this is the “Oh this is nothing compared to the last 18 weather events that knocked out the power” like damn, all that time has gone by and no one has come up with a way to keep the power from going out due to someone sneezing too close to a power line?"
"We’re two days away from people losing their minds. Hospitals are maxed out, HFD and HPD are just running in circles at this point. Pretending that this is ‘normal’ is beyond belief…"
Greg Abbott’s Texas…
Honestly we need to start holding center point accountable. It's a private company. Why can't we push them out and have our own govt run agency?  This wasn't even a cat 2 or cat 5 hurricane either. Cat 1 and you down for days?  Common Houston is used to this and the lines should be built to that standard if tech and materials allows. Maybe we need to audit where this 20 dollar fee goes? Lol
I get downvoted to oblivion every time I say it... But I'm going to keep on saying it.
"Houston, fucking SUCKS."
"People keep saying, “ let’s vote these people out” but don’t realize how knee deep red and blue politicians are when it comes to the energy industry. Not only politicians but big developers in the city as well. "
Now I’m not saying blue and red politicians in this city are one in the same but that Houston will never progress as long as the city and state relies so heavily on O&G. 
I advise people to take a toxic tour of the city so you can understand how this industry impacts Houston on every level. 
If you want to vote for change vote with your feet and move.
Dunno why you think a category one is nothing. It will still fuck shit up as we’ve seen many times in the past.
"I grew up in SETX and spent 15 years in Houston. I left. I am happy. No more year round insane heat. No more roaches or mosquitos. Less traffic. Most importantly, no flooding. Houston, I love you; you're a special place but people are not meant to live in you."
"I say this as a native Houstonian, but OH THE IRONY, of a city that is built on the back of the fossil fuel economy getting nailed by climate change. As for the ""we voted for this"" comment, yeah, some did, some didn't. I used to think TX had a voter participation problem and then was schooled when someone said, ""TX has a voter suppression problem."" Yes to all this. It's hard to overcome gerrymandering and terrible legislation when the state continues to gerrymander and suppress votes. Hard, but not impossible. Lookin at you, Georgia!"

"Keep voting in the same assholes, keep getting the same results.  Texans never learn."
Going to invest in the whole house solar/generator..
"Houston will always be ""home"", but I'm starting to get really sick and tired of living here."
"Lived here for decades, and I know ppl are mocking, but it’s true a category one hurricane was not a big scare typically. We’ve never ever evacuated for a hurricane except during Rita when we already had a road trip to see my sibling planned - I don’t really count that."
"Now I’m scared and I’m just so tired. Aren’t we all just exhausted? It’s not dramatic to say this is exhausting and is getting worse.

"
"I’ve driven out of disaster flash flood situations and stayed home for much stronger hurricanes over the years. 

"
"The fact that it’s unbearably hot and power seems even less reliable or as quick to fix in the past is unsettling.

"
I’d love to move.
"I’m tired

Friend works for Reliant and he told me to expect 4-5 days. Energy capital of the US and low grade storms and hurricanes take us off the grid. Ridiculous. Everyone who works for ERCOT should be replaced
"capitalism and greedy politicians. its not a sustainable system. the economy is garbage, most people i know are working two jobs and still barely scraping by (myself included). i literally cant afford to miss days of work or have my entire fridge/freezer full of food spoil due to this bullshit"
And how are we the “energy capital of the world…” nvm
Can you imagine how fucked we would be if this was a category 3 or 4? Or God forbid a 5!
A cat 1 hurricane causing 2 million people to lose power is highly concerning
Never forget. Texas has some of the worst voter turnout in America. Typically less just over half the population (51% - 55%) decides how the state behaves. Being in the most populace county means our votes count for a lot. It’s not an immediate fix but voting is the way to secure the future.
" I love this city
"
Vote blue for stronger regulation
"This is so legit, this is the third time after Harvey and the blizzard and still they are not prepared… its a freaking joke."
"Vote for people who will help you, not just people who hate the same as you"
"Just watched Ted Cruz give the usual bullshit speech of “resilience” “ it’s not about race, red or blue it’s about Texans coming together blah blah” “ I’m just as impacted by the storm as you guys.” 
"
"Smh right on cue, can’t wait to see the news coverage of Mattress Mack, Trae the Truth and Joel Osteen giving aid to Houstonians showing how Houston strong we are! Smh lmaoooo"
No state tax  and  incompetent corrupt government consistently being voted in. 
"It made sense in 2018. After all these events, I’m not feeling it anymore."
How did they admit to not prepare repair crews? They had 6000 people from out of the city ready as soon as the storm moved through they started working. It was all over the news.
"Stop voting in republicans. Full fkn stop. I’m not saying Dems are the fix, because Dems are mostly feckless, but begin by voting someone in who will not allow this shit to happen. "
Rule of law is the only thing short of guillotines that’s going to fix/end this shit. 
>How many deaths is it going to take before someone makes a change?  
You'll need to vote out the Republicans  in the state government if you want any change.
$CNP should fire their executive teams that are failing to make reasonable reinvestment and weatherization preparations. (Since they've legislated a bunch of states to remove the word climate change/global warming you have to call it weatherization.)
"Agreed, I am sitting at HEB because it's the only place with power and cell service.  I am done with this fucking bullshit.  I only wish I didn't have so many roots set here.  As a lifelong, born and raised resident all I have to say is fuck this place."
"It’s not a red/blue issue. Money will find its way in every politics. As Texans we are getting too attached to ideology. Ideology will not address these real issues. Whoever is not doing their work, needs to go. Big corporations and donors get cozy with whoever is in power and protects the incumbency. Stop voting along ideological lines only. Basic infrastructure is so basic and we can’t get it right!???"
Greg Abbott's in South Korea Lina Hildago left. Only reason Ted Cruz didn't go to Cancun is they're all so probably dealing with some of the after effects of the hurricane.
"Where is Ted Cruz??
Last time that moron ran away to Cancun"
Welcome to Houston.
I’m glad I left. I love Houston so much but it’s a disaster.
"If we didn't strengthen our infrastructure after Ike, we certainly aren't going to now."
"Hubs had to go to work today because they had power, but HR left out the part where the AC wasn’t working. Bastards!"
This hurricane has shown that Houston is becoming unsustainable.
Shit city
"I’m not a native Texan. I’ve a SoCal native who has been in Texas since 2004. For the facts that my home state is constantly on fire and yes, I did live through the worst earthquakes that Califoria had in modern history (looking at you Northridge Earthquake), this living in Houston thing with the hurricanes is insane. 

I’ve been through Harvey and now this. Our state should stop prioritizing profits and join either the East or West power grids. This is insane. It’s 48 hours without power so far in a heat wave for a Category 1!! And we’re lucky to have a small generator to power small appliances like the fridge, box fans, and chargers. My husband has a good job, I have good doctors, and we have family here so I think we’re stuck here (as much as I want to move home to SoCal). I want to move to a new house and while I know they’re expensive, I want a whole home generator. My health quite literally can’t handle this heat so it’s kind of a necessity if the dang state isn’t going to take care of us and make sure we don’t roast in our houses like Thanksgiving turkeys!"
Center point is going to benefit from insurance claims for their damages to lines therefore they should not bill all their customers for at least 1week of outages!!
"Our stupid Ted Cruz should help us out
We all need to call his office"
I’m literally wearing an old #houstonstrong tshirt reading this. I picked it out in the dark of my closet without knowing what I was putting on.
Just look in the mirror and say Centerpoint three times and your power should come back
"It’s because people from other states control our energy grids, when to turn on and off. Gotta love ERCOT, they f*cked us during the freeze and still continue too. I bet Whitman and Lena Hidalgo all have power though."
"Last winter, I read somewhere (forget which major credible news source) that although the state govt had mandated winterization of the power grid (incidentally, winterization was actually required after major outages in 2011), there were a lot, lot, lot of loopholes for the energy companies to not do the winterization. And don't forget that the ERCOT board members took off and evaded fines and culpability? after the winter storm Uri in 2021 where 246 people died officially related to the statewide outages. Here in Houston, some people were without heat for how long? Up to 2 weeks? And then people got slapped with $9,000/MWh bills."
"One of my brothers has lived in several cities across the US and the world. I was talking about the derecho with him and all the lost power around town, and he says, “you know that’s not normal, right? Other parts of the country don’t lose power -and STAY without power- like Houston does. That city is fucked up.” 

Not normal indeed. F+ck centerpoint."
"I’m just glad CRT has been banned and that we have the 10 commandments in school. That’s focusing on priorities. 

/s"
"It's going to stay that way until Texas shifts politically. The conservatives have been in control of Texas for 3 decades. 1) The pushed us to privatize our energy and 2) they segregated our grid from everyone else. 3) They created ERCOT and put their pals in charge of it. and 4)  have refused to force them to strengthen our power infrastructure. 

"
"But the people of Texas will keep complaining that our state is going to hell and keep hiring the same assholes responsible for it...

"
"Tell your neighbors.. ""Look, I get it. Fox has you convinced the left is nothing but pedis reading gay books to your kids in dresses... but please.. if you think there are ANY problems with the way Texas is run... just for 2 election cycles, try voting for a democrat, and see how it goes. If its no better or worse, then go ahead and vote for the GOP again... 

  
"
"Seriously. .I think the Dems could get some traction in Texas is they would run that message... ""just let us try for a few years"""
Real question: why is the energy supply in the hands of one single company? What history or politics led to this situation? Seems having more companies would be the answer.
Definitely in the top five reasons why we left Houston a few years ago. 
"My parents (who live down there) were up here in DFW for the 4th. I offered them another week as it became obvious from channel 39’s hip hop weather report on TikTok that y’all’d be getting a hurricane. 

They went home as planned anyway. They’re already regretting that choice."
I work out of town and before I make plans to come home for a weekend I need to CHECK IF I HAVE ELECTRICITY. Beryl is not the first time. This is not a problem I've encountered in any other city.
"I hope people will remember these moments, use these moments, and continue to try to bring about change through our election process."
IF only there was a national power grid that texas could connect to?
"I did my part. Removed large trees the previous owner planted right under power lines, bought a generator, a small window unit, and made sure the next house I bought had a gas stove and fireplace."
Its probably because the people running the grid have been the same for decades and their goal is making their friends money and not having a functional power grid
"We have to vote for politicians who want to spend money on infrastructure. 

The ones we have now like to blame our crumbling power grid on the federal government and their political rivals, but don't try to address it themselves."
Vote democrat or leave the state. Republicans can not run a functional government. There are essential zero Republican ran states that are not in the red when it comes to governance. Their policies don’t work.
This post is completely on point. 👍
The state voted for this. 
"There's no going back, man. Everyone said that. Everyone knew that. This isn't an ""oops let's walk it back a little now that we've learned our lesson"" situation. It's done. Houston will be unlivable arid dead land in 20 years."
We all need to evacuate this hellscape!
"Vote out Abbot and the GOP, they're the ones keeping us off the grid"
"Texas is a good example of how conservative politics are not intended to actually work. They are only meant to make some kind of point, whether or not it's actually a good point. They are willing to stand by their terrible policies to the death."
"My wife and I just had a conversation this morning. For the second time this year we’ve had to evacuate with power outages and damage to the house. And we lose power during completely normal storms as well. 

Result of conversation is that we are leaving Houston within the next year. Have been here for 10 years and liked it, but I truly believe these disasters are going to become even more common with climate change. My job is remote now and without family tying you to this city there’s just not a big enough draw now. Sucks but it’s just not feasible or safe to remain here any longer."
That decision to start vacation at Vegas looking smarter by the day……
"I definitely get wanting to leave Houston, but not for Alabama"
The sun burns all 🌞 🔥 💰 🔥 🌞
Native Houstonian considering getting the hell outta dodge. I’ve fallen out of love with this place.
"We just moved here in September. We’ve absolutely loved the diversity, beautiful outdoor spaces, and amazing people we’ve met here, but damn if we’re not already making plans to move.
As a Floridian, Texas has not excuse for poor infrastructure, especially with all the money that’s moved into the state in the past few years."
I blame Ercot and the State of Tx. There's only so much a city can do against laxed regulations like that.
After 35 years we moved. Still have our Houston house…glad it survived one last hurricane but it’s about to be someone else’s money pit 🫡
Best option is...move away
The education system down here appears fairly inadequate and half the population is confused about how the civil war ended. Why do you expect that population demographic to select effective leaders? These are the same people that have to be reminded not to drive **into** a flooded road.
"The leadership remains the same. No political action has been taken against the people responsible for the failure of the power grid. The huge influx of federal dollars from the Dems was not used to fix the grid. We are in this mess because our neighbors believe all funding should be going to ""secure our border."" Our neighbors believe that successful previous climate action is actually a failure because the world hasn't ended yet. We are fucked. A nation truly in decline. The empire killer, Afghanistan with the help of COVID, has ended the American dream. We are toast. Burnt toast."
But somehow you keep electing the same douch bag republicans and expecting different results!
Amazing how this turned into politics republican vs democrat post.
"I’m with you on that. I for the life of me can’t understand why so many were out of power and CP was not even ready to roll out a resiliency plan for a Cat 1. You would think they would have a plan for cat 5 no matter which type of hurricane  we get hit with. But instead they snapped back at us on their website.

Houston strong bitch
Houston is a corrupt cesspool of selfish politicians feeding off of the citizens. They steal cheat and lie constantly. They give contracts to whoever gives them a kickback. They have zero thoughts or cares about the people that live here. This has gone on for decades. It will continue as long as the people continue to allow them to do it.
Houston is literally a 3rd world city
"33. Been here my whole life. As an independent adult and home owner for 3 years now on my own.... First time in my life I've ever considered moving away from the coast.

"I've lived here my entire life and love Texas and where I live but more people lost power in Beryl, a category one hurricane than hurricane Ike which was a category 2 upon landfall in Galveston.

"If your power goes out every time you have a storm, Houston is the opposite of strong."
we have branch locations in texas
"m amazed how they lose power 1-2x a week at each location

"
"we dont have these issues in our locations in ""3rd world"" countries.

"
seems like you guys are living in like north korea lols
Blame the politicians. They pulled out of the national grid so they could manage it themselves. They wanted to do it cheaper and they fucking did. They fucked us.
"The biggest problem is centerpoint refusing to be proactive - my neighbors behind me have trees growing into the power lines running through the backyards. 
I send photos with address to centerpoint monthly and get no response. 
"
"They do not clear the shit thst needs to be cleared during non-emergencies and then lay the blame on homeowners for having trees and shit in the lines. 
"
So we will continue to have these issues until someone is put in charge over there that forces them to do line cleanup and maintenance outside of storm repairs.
"Regular tree trimming crews won't touch a tree growing into the power lines, they say you need to contact centerpoint and centerpoint refuses to act. 

"
Centerpoint is a fucking joke. Shouldn’t be surprised that nothing is ever done about it
Had to go all the way to Austin to get a generator just to power my fridges and a small ac unit I hate shitterpoint energy
i literally love houston and this constantly happening with no change is making me not want to be here anymore… and i planned to be here for like ever. it was only a category one.. like are they purposely doing this?!?! make it make sense.
I fucking love Houston so much but I am finally ready to start looking at living somewhere else. This is literally unsustainable.
"I hear you. I used to love this city, hate it now… dreaming about the day I have the ability to move."
🤣
"Why would they? Genuinely, why? They have your money and the ability to operate with impunity within the state of Texas so why would they give a flying fuck about you or anyone else? You’re nothing more than a guaranteed dollar sign to them."
Maybe start voting democrat and elect folks that actually care about people over profits.
Texas sucks outside the food.
"Oh man, when I think of Houston I think: ""Nah, I'm good."" Enjoy your big houses that go under water ever 10 years or so."
"Keep voting Republican at the state level,  it will never be fixed because they are bought and paid for."
"If you vote GOP, you can't be bitching about losing electricity every time the weather is out of wack."
Abbott and the other Horsemen of the Texas Apocalypse never pay a political price for their indifference to human suffering. So why should they care?
My grandmas house gets buried in 10 feet of snow and her power is still on but we get a small gust of wind and a rain drop and we’re lights out for a week and everyone is driving like a fucking moron
"Yeah, because the democrat politicians are going to miraculously convert our above-ground power lines below-ground. Great discussion as always r/houston"
"The other side of the coin is that Democrats get into power and concentrate more on social issues that affect a small minority rather than what use to be their meat and potatoes.

Occupy Center Point
Houston strong is bullshit. It's an attaboy for not rioting. When they let us down. Now watch how centerpoint passes these repairs on to its customers. It's always more of the same. Houston is still going to continue to flood the second it rains and power outages will continue to happen the second the wind blows a little too hard. Heads need to roll behind this.
"I’m left of center due to my economics and I want a Democrat that will come in and focus on jobs, raising the minimum wage, unions, and infrastructure. “It’s the economy stupid”. It’s a damn shame that Democrats managed to lose a portion of the union vote. Those use to be automatic votes."
"Love that the outage map was down for retooling and supposedly was going to be up before the end of July.

"
"Probably should have hit that a little harder Centerpoint. 

"
On another rant Whitmire inserted his own Centerpoint employee to the Chairwoman position of Metro so now every time there’s a weather event I have to worry about being able to get to work as well. (Eye problems) so I’m using PTO because we had to bail for northern counties.

"And yet Texans still vote for people like Cruz, Paxton and Abbot."
"To answer every one of your questions: Never. It's never going to get better because politicians and people responsible making sure everything runs efficiently don't care. They absolutely give ZERO f's about every person in the dark right now. Except for themselves, of course, but they have backup generators, so they'll need to sleep with blankets tonight. Their room will be too cold to sleep without a warm, cozy blanket to snuggle up with."

This was always a swamp but then you bring in human hubris of the powerful - here we are. All of these powerhouses are what made Houston a heavily polluted area with no zoning and chemical plants everywhere. Then you touch up on the politics of the place which are also led by corporate interests in BOTH parties - then where is there going to be substantial change? Not to mention, due to Houston being incredibly blue we are constantly being messed with by our very spiteful state government....

"Community is what makes Houston great but unfortunately the community is not being nurtured and is in fact being burned out by all of the bullshit. Without a major disruption to the hustle lifestyle here, are we truly unified outside of that?

Losing power seems to be a huge gripe here, where is your generator? Don't have one? That's on You. If you failed to mitigate issues that affect you, that's Your fault. It's not a corporations fault that a tree comes down and takes out power. That's just part of life in a first world.

"The reason why the grid is so waked , simply because of the over growth of population. They can’t keep up with all the people moving here . Doesn’t matter what they do ! And can’t complain when power lines are lying on the street. Linemen are working their ass’s off to get it back up an running. It’s hilarious to me how people can’t go one day without power without whining about being hot and pissed about Houston. I’m more pissed about everyone moving here and causing all the problems. It wasn’t like this 10yrs ago."
Good god people are spoiled.
Then gtfo wtf
"Well, it’s a democrat run city. People keep voting these idiots in. The change you want needs to come from the person in the mirror."
Tired of being Houston strong all the time? Lol its only a couple of days of the year. People exaggerate too much.
No city in the country would’ve been able to take this storm without power outages.
"Maybe prepare better next time like an adult? Ya know, with a generator? Maybe some gas? A power bank? This is Houston and we get bad storms. And we live in a giant swamp. The Governor, the Mayor, the police will not save you. Places with better climates cost more and understandably so."
By the end of day July 10th they're projecting to be at over a million out of power still. Took 6 days to get power restored to 900k in May. It'll be late next week until everyone is taken care of.
"Don’t worry, they’ll still bill you somehow even when there’s no power"
"Family member who works for CNP said they are internally pushing for all restoration work to be done by Sunday. The 14th!!! Not surprising but still disappointing. We knew since Friday it was going to hit, and the way they waited until it actually made landfall to start staging the out of town crews is so negligent."
"Our power came back on last night before bed but went back out before we woke up because the lines caught fire. Now who knows how long it will take them to fix it. When we got up and went outside, they were trying to keep the flames from reaching the houses."
Don’t forget to make arrangements.
"They think their lying ass is slick. They told our community it was fixed yesterday, but the fact is that they shut off the water to fix low voltage issue and now we have neither water or electricity."

You summed it up.

"Directed away from Houston to other parts of the state. This is a state level problem, with a corrupt single party system that has effectively written off Houston as a power base. Seriously, Abbott and Patrick provide zero headship when it comes to hazard prevention/mitigation."
Our neighborhood has had a ton done to it to mitigate flooding but we're in a flood zone. What they did worked really well. The neighborhood didn't flood this time and they aren't even finished.
This is why you never vote yes to increase taxes for \*insert thing\*.
It's why CA and Los Angeles have $7 gas and $5 gallon milk. Every single year people vote yes to add taxes for some random thing that sounds good on paper and then the bureaucracy never gets anything done.
Where did you go?
"Yep the change is permanent and is likely to get even more intense both in sustained high temperatures and intensity of hurricanes when they do hit. 

Considering Texas’s role in profiting from fossil fuels tho it’s really just karma."
It's wild to me how many folks are willingly living in a giant sea level swamp metro in a severe weather area that's getting worse and worse courtesy of the city's oil-based economy contributing to climate change.
Did you leave to another city or state?
People are always talking about how they love that the community always comes together in times of need and help out. Most people in cities all over the country would do that it’s just Houston is always dealing with some disaster so you frequently see it here..
"and just for him to not even be here when the storm hit. he’s at an “economic summit” in Taiwan, where they’re discussing strategies on how to build a $40 BILLION semiconductor chip manufacturing plant in Texas. wish we could find that kind of money to invest in our own fucking power grid…"

"They don’t outnumber them, the districts are so gerrymandered."
"This is just it, the country is not so much red v blue but more rural v urban. Government can be good, as an example, in the city because it fixes infrastructure and helps regulate laws that *meant* to benefit the city. Government can be bad, as an example, in the countryside because some unknown hand is asking for a regulatory fee or is telling you that you can't do some thing or the other because you haven't filed such and such (see the recent Supreme Court case). People will always vote for what benefits them and to fix the areas of their lives, and even though the majority populas of the United States is in a city, our government is meant for equal representation through Congress etc."
Well said. Gotta own them libs tho!

"1. They don't

"Texas is a non-voting state. That’s the problem. Most of the people who can vote just won’t show up. I think the last presidential election only had 60% of voters out, and it drew higher than usual numbers. The midterms? 40%. Local? Less than that. People need to get out and VOTE. Every election. Every race."
"The rural base also really values being “self sufficient” and not needing government. I come from one of the more rural areas in Harris County, and when the power shuts off for days we just deal with it. We cut down our trees, trade food, boat in the flooded streets, etc. We live like this for weeks sometimes and seldom complain.

The community and self-sufficiency this creates is great; I genuinely think its good to be challenged like this. Hardship is life. But at the same time, it creates complacency and lets companies off the hook — but shits still gotta get done, and you cant wait to be rescued. Shit like this shouldn’t happen regardless because it’s genuinely dangerous in the grander scheme of things.

"Very King of the Hill energy — some goo Very King of the Hill energy — some good in the general bad. But yea this is why rural voters keep voting for people that are in the pockets of companies.

Government work means you don't get a raise if you do a good job. You also don't get fired if you do a bad job. You just have to be popular enough during elections to get 1% more votes than the next guy.
I live in the rust belt next to a Great Lake. I travel to Texas all the time for work and everyone there always makes fun of the mistake on the lake and talks about how awesome Texas is….i just don’t see it. I love the food in Texas but that’s about the only reason I’d go there if I didn’t have work.
"I hope that this is a wake up call for Houston this election. A cat 1 hurricane causing our power to go out this bad is unacceptable. It’s like we’re stuck in a perpetual cycle of disaster after disaster with the same old consequences and aftermath of most of the entire fucking city out of power. Instead they keep on focusing and making big deals out of things no asked them to. I’m so done with this state and city, I love it but our leaders do not have our best interests in mind."
A TV we can’t even watch. Lol. I thought about that yesterday. They are all hyped up and gonna be there to give us all the information and we haven’t a clue sitting at home in the dark.
Yup this here... We are having these issues because we keep putting the same dipshits in power. How many times does this need to happen for the Texas voters to vote blue for a change? What's the worst that can happen? They disappoint you and you vote their asses out too?.. or we can vote for the same assholes that have fucked us for decades again. 😐
This is it right here. If you live in a large city in Texas then it makes no sense for you to vote republican. They are actively trying to make your life worse because their rural constituents want to see you suffer.

That's not true, they have one policy position: Hate for all non-white non-males. They push their hate into everything. Even their biblethumping bullshit is to push that hate. It's an excuse to further the hate."
"Push rank choice voting and frame it in a ‘you would likely get two red candidates facing off’. Even if it did happen that way, it would force voters to do more than pull the ‘R’ lever, forcing the candidates to be different, and one would hopefully position themselves as more moderate. We need candidates and voters awake up to the last minute of elections on all sides! No more safe seats!"
"Look whom they vote for in California. In reality it doesn’t matter. We can keep on posting fiery speeches here, but as long as politicians stay unaccountable, nothing will change for the better."
You have to be completely ignoring PG&E drama from California to think Democrats give a rat's ass about people's utilities either. Both of these parties are greased by similar people.
I feel the same. I'm the only young Democrat voter in my family and I just don't understand how they keep deluding themselves.
"It’s not really a politics thing.  California on the other extreme politically has a disaster of a power company that is now charging 38 cents per kWh, highest in the country by far, AND a monthly fixed cost of $24 on top, as they are legally able recoup the billions they lost due to damages and lawsuits from the wildfires they started.

"Physical Damage: The main culprit is physical damage to the power infrastructure. Hurricane-force winds can topple power lines, rip down transformers, and snap transmission towers. Debris like fallen trees can further complicate matters by tangling with power lines.

"
"Flooding:  Hurricanes often bring torrential rains and storm surge, which can flood substations containing electrical equipment. Damaged or submerged equipment takes time to repair or replace.

"
"Safety Concerns:  Even after the storm passes, crews might not be able to immediately start repairs.  High winds, debris, and flooding can create unsafe working conditions.  Utility companies prioritize the safety of their workers before sending them out.

"
"Cascading Effects:  Damage to one part of the grid can have a domino effect.  If a key transmission line is down, entire sections of the grid can be knocked offline.  Restoring power isn't just about fixing a single downed line, it's about bringing the entire system back online in a coordinated fashion.

"
"Overwhelmed Infrastructure:  The sheer scale of damage from a major hurricane can overwhelm repair crews.  Utilities may need to bring in crews from other regions, which takes time and coordination."
"Under Republican governors, Texas built and amassed more solar and wind generation than any other state, even more than most countries. Our state population and power demand is on a constant upward trajectory.

I have a feeling Democrats here don't push huge climate stuff in campaigns because they don't want to anger people in the oil and gas industry.

It’s a somewhat different culture in some ways aka “what kind of car do you drive” but a lot of that because it’s otherwise flat and drab so people are looking for cool stuff to buy. but if you find your niche and put yourself out there it’s still one of the better cities in the us.

Not sure why you are being downvoted. This ain't a bad idea!
Hiw much did that cost if you don't mind me asking? The solar panels and installation
Just throw a shit-ton of money at it. Got it.
"It's the result of a deregulated energy market. The people who did it aren't in office anymore because of time, but the current government of Texas keeps it going, so Abbot, Dan Patrick and the rest of their ilk are who you should be looking at. Want meaningful change? Texas needs to rejoin the national grid and we need to put people in office who will do that."
Except they didn't even. Deregulation works both ways. They can charge more for less here and they do.
"Well, that definitely *is* a problem, but it's hardly the biggest. When 10 transmission towers are taken out, tree limbs are the least of your problems. It's crumbling infrastructure and a deregulated energy market that's not forced to do anything about it. That's the problem."
"All this on top of having to replace shingles,fence, and tons of leaks"
"It makes me sad that this is downvoted. If you think Republicans running Texas is *not* the problem here, you are the problem here."

I’m sorry. The State of Texas decides to manage its own electrical grid and you lay that at the feet of the federal government? Thats a bit of a leap don’t you think?

The brainwashing is real.
"What a weird flex. What you've described is the opposite of first world. It's more like Caribbean Strong. I have also lived in the USVI (Saint John) and other Caribbean islands (SXM and Antigua). The entire island of St. Croix is roughly the same size as George Bush Park. It is completely reasonable to expect the 4th largest city in the continental United States to have less expensive electricity and more reliable, convenient infrastructure than an island the size of George Bush Park.

"
"Expensive electricity and rolling blackouts are frequent and expected because they are remote Caribbean islands. Building quality, reliable infrastructure is difficult and more expensive than the main land. 

"
"A/C is a luxury and generally not needed because the weather is perfect in the VI. Not so in Houston.

"
"A lot of buildings have their own generators on the islands because grid type electricity is inconsistent or non-existent.

It's insane that you would even think about trying to compare Houston and the Caribbean.
"Why is it on us? We're paying our bills each month right? You're just reassigning responsibility from the people that should be keeping this from happening to us.

Oh my god your balls are so huge you're so HOUSTONSTRONGGGGGGGGG my panties are wetter than a Cat 5
"Well, people *actually* die in situations like this. It's not really overdramatic when it is a thing that happens. I mean I guess you can be blasé about it because it's usually only a few people each time, but some might think any death due to a simple loss of power is probably something to be a bit dramatic about."
Yes its too many people moving out here and their building houses in areas that shouldn’t be built on.

The whole state is a 3rd world shithole thanks to the state government
Pretty sure you have Stockholm Syndrome. A lot of people in Houston do.
"Some, yes. Our power went out because of a tree falling on a power line. That's act of God stuff that you can never control. 55% of customers losing power, for a city the size of Houston? Nope. That's unacceptable no matter how you cut it."
High voltage transmission lines were taken down during the derecho I havent seen any reports of that happening from the hurricane.
My came back today
And what’s infuriating is that the out of state “help” hasn’t all arrived yet! Wth? What kind of disaster aid / planning is this? This was a TS that passed through (not even a Cat 1)! The city should be ashamed!

Thats not right why do we have to burn time off for a natural disaster.
You have to use your PTO for a HURRICANE? America is so terrible.

"Yes to both of y’all! I’m highly considering leaving Texas in a couple years, but in the meantime, I’m saving all my PTO so I can ✌️ out the next time there’s a hurricane because I cannot"
They keep asking if I'm ok to work.  No I am not Dx.
This!!!! Can’t even save for a decent vacation
They won’t blame the power outages. They’ll just blame people that have conditions that caused the death. That’s their logic. Crazy.
I got word a family members neighbor seems to be in needs of some kid of help. They are working on it today. Elderly with mobility issues. He asked to have his windows opened and I’m sure some other small things. He likely needs to be in a shelter or cooling center for the daytime until they get power back. But they have pets so who knows
People work outside in the heat every day for a living. People survived a long time without A/C 😂. The only ones dealing with life threatening circumstances are the ones trying to repair the damages.

"
"Anyone who has ever lived in Illinois knows how damn reliable electric services are in extreme weather, whether thunderstorms or tornadoes or blizzards. Outages are quickly fixed with accurate maps. I also lived in Indonesia for work, and despite intense typhoons we rarely lost any power.

"But I also think people throwing stuff out already yesterday is crazy unless you’ve been opening your fridge and freezer a bunch. Milk and stuff might not be great today but condiments will be fine. Sandwich meat and cheese are still fine and can always be thrown in a cooler with ice. Fruit and vegetables will be fine for a few days. Just don’t keep opening the fridge over and over. If I threw away all my food every time the power was out for 4 hours I’d be cleaning out the fridge twice a month. 

"
Our power was out for 4 days after the derecho. I checked our chest freezer right when the power came back on and everything was still frozen solid. I keep that thing packed tight. That’s where all the meat is. The weaker freezer just has veggies and stuff. But if we get to this weekend and still don’t have power I guess I’ll be grilling while we try to get the fences put back up.
Yup. A lot of people said that. Like I’m not suppose to feed my wife and 3 kids.
"No they said people are dumb for buying more **perishables** than they can keep fresh with their setup in case of a hurricane, in a hurricane prone region, during hurricane season.

"Also, Mexico has an incredibly underfunded and mismanaged national electricity provider so maybe creates some understanding for why things are the way they are there. Centerpoint is a company making billions in profits and yet their infrastructure can’t even handle a light wind/rain? In our area the power went out way before the strong parts of the hurricane even got to us."
"In some “third world” countries, the power goes out less than it does in Houston. In Mumbai, we almost never lost power during insane monsoon storms and typhoons. The streets would be flooded completely, and people would still have power. It would take an absolute catastrophe for the whole grid to break down.

I've lost power exactly one time in my 6 years here and it was for less than 10 min lol
"While I largely agree with the sentiment, it's not that easy to uproot your life and move. I count myself lucky that I was able to. A lot of people have close ties to friends and family and it's hard to move jobs without already living in the city you want to work in. And moving is expensive, especially cross country. 

I wish I could get my parents to move. They are getting older and I get concerned for them every time this happens. They have lived their whole lives in Houston and don't want to leave their lifelong friends, so I get it, but it's hard to hear they lost power again (and the backup generator had a leak) while my mom has pneumonia."
Yes that’s why we’re all exhausted. Didn’t we just do this same exact shit a few weeks ago?
"Houston really always has had great community. But that was back when it was spread out over years. I think everyone is just exhausted. I remember back for Harvey, I bought a bunch of pizzas and drinks and drove around a hard hit neighborhood handing out food and drinks. I also cleaned out an older lady’s home that I didn’t even know with a crew I signed on with that was destroyed. But I just can’t do that anymore."
Not a lot of cities anywhere in the world built to withstand a direct hit from a Cat 5.
Can't gerrymander statewide positions. The truth is rurals vote and city folk don't for the most part.
Gerrymandering doesn’t impact statewide races at all.  Who wins statewide races?  Who did Texas vote for for President?
"Agree with much of this but people often don’t vote for the things that benefit or enrich their lives.  The so-called “pocketbook issues” frequently aren’t driving our/their political decisions. There are many different policies that rural areas can benefit from but they vote against the politicians who want to enact them for other reasons. And on the rare occasions when a beneficial policy gets through anyway, residents in those areas often don’t give credit where it’s really due."

"My power came back this afternoon thankfully but a power station saved my sanity so I could watch TV for a bit with the antenna. If I had a smaller TV I could probably watch for hours under one charge. I have the Jackery Explorer 880 and a smaller one (Costco package with solar panels) which wasn't cheap (originally got it for my late father's oxygen machine) but even a modest 300 or 500 watt hour one can really help out with electronics, a small fan, etc. and you can recharge it in your car, office, or at a friend's. 

"
"That's what got me. Power was out. Internet was out. Cell went down. Kept telling everyone to watch for updates, while I sit in the dark holding a useless brick that used to be a cell phone. Thanks."
Maybe something to consider getting for the next power outage...and we all know there will be another one. It's one of the things I don't regret buying at all.
“We’ll turn into California!!!”
It’s not so much the large cities. There are lot of suburbanites and rural voters causing this.
"Damn people are so dumb, Houston is run by a Liberal mayor and Judge for the longest time already… Ever since California people moved here with green energy it got very bad."
But Lina Hidalgo and her blue buddies are literally the ones ducking up with is situation right now. All the elected officials in Houston are democrats.
"I loved it when they blamed wind energy as cause of the deaths during the freeze.   The worse part is i had every red republican repeating that shit at work and most of my colleagues are college grads, some with masters and phd."
Because Houston’s democrat mayors have improved Houston’s infrastructure so much. Please. It’s both parties. They are both controlled by the special interest groups that pay them to agree on stuff.
"well, they do say yes to grift, profits, our laws&your order, religious indoctrination, tax breaks for themselves and lack of accountability."
Take a look at UK. They voted those fuckers out bc they couldn’t actually govern anything and here we are again having re-voted Abbott in. We have a new chance in November to get rid of Cruz.

There has to be some standards so no matter who is in the office no matter the side. They need to be accounted for those metrics otherwise they are sent to jail."
TIL California is the only blue state and loses power for millions in their largest city several times a year
PG&E issues were heavily caused by Enron.  A Houston  firm that was remarkable in how explicitly Republican it was
Kk so let's try some blue grease for a change
Let’s not let’s also not forget that they pay double what we do for unreliable electricity in California..
Lol what's the houston mayor gonna do
How are they investing in the grid or other infrastructure to prevent future energy shortages?
"Cool, but what about the infrastructure moving that power around? It seems like that is the problem, not power production."
"That’s exactly what it is. The democrats here in Houston are at best moderately liberal. So even if we outnumbered the rural conservative voters the O&G industry will still have these politicians in a chokehold. Texas is too dependent on it and Houston is still proud to be considered “ the energy capital of the world”. 

"
Houstonians can’t expect change in an area that is this dependent on an industry like O&G.
"Texas Democratic party is garbage, practically a fundraising subsidiary of the national party and nothing else. If someone ran on accepting federal Medicare money, finding public infrastructure projects, and just never said the word gun, they could be a full blown maoist and probably do better than the Dems."
If there is an impact of climate change on Houston energy infrastructure that should be explained. We need new ideas for protecting electrical transmission.
I work in o&g... Anyone afraid of renewable energy is working for the wrong company. Any good company has already divested at this point and has a side of their company dedicated to renewable because it's inevitable.
"And you thought Centerpoint doesn't have to answer to anyone.   Yeah, OK."
"Honest question, I cannot figure out what words you are mixing together with snovid.

" Some of the chemical plants could use hardening but that is likely impossible as a retrobuild.   I have not read anything that suggest that those chemicals would be leaked at scale during a flood.    The biggest worry I read was that the plants would be put out of service for an extended period of time. 

"
The weather events haven't been every 5 years.   2017 you had Harvey.  That is 7 years ago.  2011 was Ike.  It has always been like this but just has been made worse over the years due to wetlands being built on with no replacement so the water has no place to go but sit on the surface and flood.   The bayou needs an upgrade to help get the water out of the city as quickly as possible to mitigate flooding.  There was work on that after Harvey but I don't know how much was done.
start drinking small amounts of chemicals in your water to build immunity. Although if you have city water it’s already there

You heard it here folks... Identity politics is the reason why our power grid is so atrociously managed. What a joke.
"No. But I expect outreach, providing updates, and providing either contact info for resources or resources themselves. 

In other words, I expect THE BARE MINIMUM OF A PERSON WHO WAS ELECTED TO REPRESENT ME. All I’ve seen from his Twitter and website are a lack of listing of resources, no outreach to affected areas, but several posts of thoughts and prayers. 

I’ll ensure I return the latter this November."

"Your were not talking about the west coast, we are talking about Texas. Where Houston, Austin, Dallas, are. And they’re all democrat run cities. Leading the nation is reduced homelessness.

You can’t even go to work on a normal day without fearing that the energy grid is going to fail. Can’t even look at them with your ring cameras when that happens. Come home to heartbreak.
"My roommate’s calling in. They have more people at their job, so they won’t lose their job if they call in. Obviously, I was going to figure something out. I live paycheck to paycheck, but I also love my cat. I was just stressed because this shouldn’t be an issue."
"Depends on where you are - when I lived in Bellevue, WA it was quite diverse. 

"
Moved to Oregon a year ago and it is not diverse at all here. Even living in the college town Eugene.
Ah. That's a good idea. Setting aside 5k a year for emergency get out of x hurricane fund. Good idea. Rofl
Assuming you’ve got eh gas meter and infrastructure for a seamless install
A portable generator that will power the whole home plus utility hookups will run $3k.
Those same people can afford to just have 5k sitting around waiting for a hurricane like the poster said? Come on man
Fair enough. Nobody can fault you for taking hurricane vacations lol
Texas is a shit hole state. Perfect example of “free dumb” smh.
"The fact that 85% of Houston lost power from a Cat 1 hurricane should be a wake up call.

"I’ve lived all over the US, east coast, west coast, Midwest, south east. I’ve done it all. 

"
Or it never happened prior to 1996... who was in charge then? Go figure 🤔
You’re right about the last part. I’ve been here for 12 years. Originally from NJ. I lived through some crazy snow storms and blizzards growing up and never once did we lose power. I’m starting to get tired of it and want something more stable. That being said I know Dallas is still in Texas but does their power go out often like it does here? I would be willing to move to Dallas the job market seems better out there now that I’m looking.
"Part of my pre-hurricane checklist is getting a bag of ice and popping it in the freezer. No one is allowed to open the freezer for the first 24 hours after the power goes out. After that, fire up the grill."

Louisiana is a crime-ridden shithole, right along with Mississippi. Florida is an overpriced hellhole that continues its ""war on woke"" to the detriment of its citizens (insurance companies are jumping like rats on a sinking ship), Arkansas and Oklahoma is basically if ""The Handmaids Tale"" came to life..."
"This is not true for a lot of areas in Mexico. My husband and I split our time between Mexico and Houston. Our power in Mexico is out for sometimes 1-2x a week for almost the full day if it goes out. After the hurricane, it was out for 2-3 days without cell phone service as well.

Not defending Centerpoint as they're garbage. Just speaking from experience."
"To be honest, it is the same in CA with PGE power outage with small hurricane and rain. I have a feeling the foundation of electric grid system is flawed and they refuse to improve"
"In houston i have no idea what is going on anymore? What? The power only goes out when there is extreme weather like a hurricane, tornado, deep freeze which is a few days of the year. Its not like the power goes out everyday. What part of houston do you live in? Iam in westbury and light rain and wind does not cause a power outage."
"Exactly what I was going to comment! Some cities in ""third world"" countries like India, do restore power to storm-hit zones within 24 hours even in the case of extreme flooding."
"Here in Guatemala the power goes out almost everyday for hours which is more annoying. Been in houston over 25 years and the total number of days ive been without power is 7 days. So 7 days out of the 9,000 days is pretty good power grid system if u ask me."
Not the same. You were deployed there so u were taking care of by the USA.
"Literally all the elected representatives in Houston are democrats. The mayor, Lina Hidalgo...like all of them."

"I grew up around Houston, but lived most of my adult life in Chicago. It’s home. Moved to Hawaiʻi for a bit (got a divorce, and I was over the winters lol), but I’ve been back here taking care of my mom for a few months. I can’t take it, and I’m moving home to Chicago in September. Like you, I can think of *maybe* one time in 20+ years the power ever failed, and only for ten or fifteen minutes. Cannot wait to be back—winters and all. "
Moved here 3 months ago from Logan Square in Chicago. I regret every second 😪
The cold and wind don’t bother you?
How is the job market there?

A lot of cities would've been torn apart by Ike
"Harris County has some of the worst voter suppression in the county. Harris County, with 5 million people and greater in landmass than the state of Rhode Island, only has ONE ballot dropbox for the entire county. And the state government is trying to overturn elections in the county.

Gerrymandering depresses turnout

Because people have rightfully concluded that their vote won't change much when it comes to the pocketbook issues. It always comes back to the relative strength of particular interest groups in a given jurisdiction.
"Oh i agree with you friend, rest assured"
"Thanks. Yes, I have a small power bank that I’m charging my phone on right now. I am definitely planning more heavily when the power is back. I’m glad you got yours. I hope we get ours soon."

"I'm a proponent of alternative energy generation, but both solar and wind are not reliable under certain circumstances. Solar farms do not have near enough battery capacity to provide power when there's no sun. And if there's no wind, which certainly happens, wind turbines aren't generating power.

"

Stop voting for politicians who want to want to ban common sense electric generation like natural gas. Our population and electricity demand grow every year. We can't build enough alternative only generation to keep up."
"This. Lee Brown, Bill White, Annise Parker, and Sly Turner had almost a quarter century to improve Houston’s infrastructure and all they’ve done is propose and sign numerous bond proposals that saw them make money for themselves and their sponsors while the city’s infrastructure continued to crumble around them."
Turner did a lot of flood mitigation projects
A city's resources are a pittance compared to a state.
Im not really sure how much a city mayor can do about a states power grid
It’s not both parties.

"California Dems are very pro-market and pro-tech, too"
It’s pretty reliable for me. Hasn’t ever been out. I’ll pay a little extra for that reliability
"The energy shortage issues aren’t related to hurricanes knocking out power. New Orleans, Mississippi, and Florida all have outages during hurricanes and some on average are longer than ours. 

The energy capacity for outages / blackouts are an issue, but even if that was solved 100% we’d still be without power because if there was no shortage and down lines it wouldn’t make a difference from point A to point B."
Where did I say that?
Snow. You never heard the winter storm power outages mentioned as  snovid 2021?

"It wasn't 80MPH sustained winds. It made landfall at that but Houston at most got 60MPH and most areas were 40-50MPH.

"
"Regardless. In California, building codes enforce that structures need a minimum amount of earthquake resistance, for example. If you're building transmission towers on the coast, they should be able to withstand Hurricane force winds. It can be done. The problem is that it costs more money, and the if no one is forcing Centerpoint or the other energy providers to spend that money, they'll obviously choose not to. That's why you need some level of regulation. This is what you get with a completely unregulated energy market."
That's crazy.  Hope it gets fixed soon.

They just pass the cost to us so they don't have to possibly miss one damn payment to shareholders."
You are absolutely correct! More reason to leave this city that's just too big and mishandled.
"Absolutely no one is wondering what’s the big deal. Everyone understands how hot and miserable it is, including the people sitting in the AC with their generators. Side note, we have a shitty grid in a shitty town with shitty lawmakers who can’t navigate the shitty weather. Unfortunately generators are increasingly becoming an expensive necessity around here."

100%!! The U.S. would be so much better if the citizens were United
"What's difficult to understand? The situation outlined is a tenant who can't install a generator at all. So yes, moving somewhere where as a tenant they don't need to is the only alternative."
"Same. Well not the Pa part but I was born in Florida. We only lost power for the really bad hurricanes (category 3/4) but  it was usually restored the next day or so. When I moved to Texas, the first thing unnoticed is that flooding happened way too often and the power went out even if it was just sprinkling outside. I live in another state now and haven’t lost power in the 3 years I’ve been here. lol."
"Houston has a weird way of just looking the other way, like everyone forgets once we get power and lights back.  If you say you have problems with the current situation you're told shut up, this is life here, scram if you don't like it. 

Yet all these people in other states, you, person in FL will be like, hey you know we deal with the same and we had better infrastructure.

"I grew up in Houston and can’t tell you how many times we lost power during storms, but it was quite a bit; most memorable time was for over a week after hurricane Ike in 2008. I’ve lived in NJ now for over 10 years and have yet to experience a power outage."

I cannot remember a single notable power outage from anywhere I lived prior to Houston, and I grew up hiding in the tub for tornados and doing tornado drills often at school…I can also remember specific storms that disrupted school and tornados but no meaningful power outages. I had so many since moving here that I have a standby generator now. I didn’t even know what that was or that it existed residentially prior to moving here."

"There is no excuse for Houston, which has an insanely high per capita GDP, to lose power after a category 1 storm for multiple days, especially when we are in a hurricane prone region. Also, I know multiple people who have lost power for a week or more on multiple different occasions, so you must be lucky. Sure, there are worse places, but we are woefully underprepared compared to other similarly rich places prone to bad weather, and even many places which are poorer than us.

"

If you think we have a good grid, I am going to venture a guess that you haven’t lived many other places in the developed world. Our grid is a steaming pile of crap compared to what it should be."
There is absolutely no way you’ve lived here for 25 years and experienced only 7 days without power.  🙄
"it's all relative to your own experience, but we're allowed to have higher standards here."
I've been without power at least 25 days in the last few years and this is a multibillion dollar company. What's their excuse? We don't even have cell service. It happened with the last big storm too.
You don't know what my assignment was.
Houston’s power grid isn’t controlled solely internal to the city and most of your tax dollars don’t go to the city
"I guess I'm on my pro-Chicago soapbox today, so let's go with it. For anyone considering Chicago, just know that the ""loop"" isn't really where lots of people live and hang out. There are those that do, and it is beautiful as a downtown, but the neighborhoods outside of the loop are where the city shines imo. Kind of like in Houston how few people live in downtown proper, but there's a vibe to Montrose vs the Heights vs Rice Village etc. The difference is that in Chicago, there's a big variety of neighborhoods, and getting between each neighborhood is usually as simple as hopping on a bus or a train.

I would love better environmental protections too. Sure Cali has higher taxes but it seems like yall get something out of it. We have $$$ property taxes and the lights can’t even stay on when it rains much less in a hurricane.
Public transport worth mentioning in CA? Outside of SF? Where?!?!!? Or is ‘municipal bus system’ a dirty word in Tx?

One decision cost the lives of 100s during the freeze and we have yet to do what's needed.
I was with you till you said natural gas. There’s so much pumped and burned in west Texas that prices are negative sometimes. We aren’t lacking for natural gas generation of electricity. I think you meant to say nuclear energy. We can build nuclear energy plants wherever there is need. Not just closest to the source.

No need for the weird energy. Rolling blackouts have happened pretty much every year here. Often enough to need generators. That’s not an opinion just facts. My stupid garage apartment gets up to 113 degrees inside WITH a window unit running. Thats not an exaggeration I keep humidity and thermostats in every room to keep track and have pictures to prove it. If the power goes out during a heat wave my pups are cooked. And before you get condescending again yes I’m actively in the process of moving.
People losing power on a regular day is pretty normal occurrence. Power infrastructure is a shit show here.
Yes there’s a lot of underlying issues with infrastructure and the people that are in charge of our power. All of the solutions I present at least keep you comfortable until those issues are fixed.
"Also if I were renting, I’d have a 3-5k inverter generator with a window unit. That’s under $1k and can keep you cool and power your refrigerator.

"Get a soft start installed on your AC unit, and what the person you're replying to is saying not that far off. 10-15k watt generator is in that ball park and you just need an electrical hookup installed and gas line ran from your meter.

  You should never have anything plugged in when starting up your generator by the way. Also, if you're that concerned about frying your electronics, get an inverter generator."

"Been in houston for 25 years or 9000 days. 7 days out of those 9,000 days i have been without power. Thats rather good imo"
Oh i see. My dad told me the power went out during the storm not before
My power has never gone out on random sunny days. It only goes out on extreme weather conditions and most of the time it only goes out for a couple of minutes.
"Yes i have been very lucky or the houston grid is actually good. During Mays tornado storm, no power for 5 minutes. The big freeze in 2021 i was without power for 10 hours. When Hurricane Harvey hit the power was out for 1 hour. Hurricane Ike no power for 12 hours. Not bad"

"I grew up in SoCal and have bussed pretty much everywhere down here. I don't think there is anywhere you can't get by bus. Pretty much every beach, county resource and park around here has a bus stop near it. Some of the larger residential neighborhoods only have a few stops but some cities do it better than others though. I have ridden public transportation from LA to San Diego before and it's pretty awesome once you get out of the city, it just takes a few hours.
"
"
The times I've visited Houston it seemed the downtown area had some decent busses but I never had a chance to ride them."
"I was actually very surprised with San Diego’s train and bus system for $6 or so. Got me from the airport to Carlsbad where I had to pick up my car. An Uber would’ve cost $50+! The views on the train by the coast are better, too."
"Oh yeah LA sucks in general. I could’ve told you that. But I’ve explored pretty much every corner of this fine state and find the claims against it exaggerated. Yes I’ve seen needles in a parking lot at Vons. Yes I’ve seen homeless people yell and even urinate in an alley. Yes I’ve seen my share of poop and litter. I find it all pretty rare though. I guess San Diego county, Monterey, the OC, Humboldt county and outer sunset San Francisco is pretty nice for the most part because that’s where I’ve spent most of my time here. Right now I’m in a renovated McDonald’s in a nice subdivision called Valley Center. Nice, new family homes with solar panels. Clean, pothole free streets. A few RVs. So be it. I find it beautiful here and in most of the state. Yes there is Skid Row and tenderloin if you want to cherry pick the worst areas and assume the entire state is like that but for the most part it seems safe and clean in CA. Spent about 6 years out here so far. Back in Houston I recall littered Lake Houston, couches dumped on off ramps, burned down houses around Aldine, Gunspoint mall, my siblings having guns pulled on them, being burgled, seeing cart pushing bums, drug dealers everywhere, dog crap, thieves, graffiti… Houston’s not perfect either. Lived there roughly 20 years and I’d much rather spend 20 years in California. I’ll let you know in 14 years if I redact my statement!"
I have family on my husband's side that irritated me so much with that. I would bring up an issue and a solution that Democrats have without mentioning party lines and she would agree. But then I asked why she didn't vote for people that agree with those same policies and she brought up that her and family all vote red because of abortion.
I mentioned NG because it one resource that's being pushed to ban in many liberal states.  I think some places like California ban NG appliances outright in new home construction in certain regional areas.  NG and Nuclear need to remain an option regardless of how much renewable energy we produce.   Batteries or other means of energy storage need to be cost affordable before there is any talk of eliminating NG or Nuclear.
"Nah dudes a dipshit. Battery availability isn't a function of solar efficiency. If his complaint about solar was ""there aren't enough batteries"" was genuine, the solution is more batteries, which doesn't effect the actual generation of power."

Houston has plenty of funding. Unfortunately we are spending billions to try to protect our borders which could have been used to fix infrastructure. Will it ever be fixed? Doubtful but it needs an overhaul ASAP

I'm not defending Centerpoint because they especially suck right now,  but the willful ignorance people are displaying simply bc another's reality goes against their beliefs. SMH"
"You are incredibly lucky. I was out of power for 2 weeks after Ike, 5 days after the big freeze, 5 days after the delecho and now- who knows?"
"That is not rather good, compared to the rest of the developed world, especially when you can easily triple that number for many people, and we have had outages during extreme temperatures multiple times in the last few years. It has gotten worse since the freeze.

Why are you so accepting of sheer mediocrity and corruption from our government?"
My internet and power go on on random days as well. Infrastructure here is absolutely a joke. I’m from the NE and never had to deal with these issues before moving here. Going back asap. It’s sad that folks like you normalize these issues and just accept them.
"You are just lucky. During the big freeze, we didn’t have power for over 48 hours (it was literally freezing inside), during Ike, we didn’t have power for like 10 days, and during Harvey, we didn’t have power for about 2 days luckily (but the same cannot be said about the people in flood plains). We also lost power for like 3-4 days after the derecho, and there were a couple of times we lost it for a day or so at our office every time the wind picked up a little. 

This is spread out across 4 different addresses too in different parts of the city."
I didn’t have power for 2+ weeks during Ike and it was miserable.
"- Lakeview / Lincoln Park: Lots of transplants move here when they first come to Chicago. Lakeview (including Wrigleyville where the cubs play) is lots of early to mid 20-somethings, big party scene with lots of bars and restaurants. You do have some folks in their 30s but it's catered to a younger crowd with lots of sports bars and dive bars. Lincoln Park kinda mixes in with Lakeview but trends a bit older minus the area around DePaul. Decently more expensive, but right in the action of the city in terms of things to do and nightlife. Convenient to get anywhere on the train, especially downtown for commuters (used to be 30 min door to door for me). It can be kind of chaotic just with how many people live there and are out and about all the time, but that's my 30s talking. I lived there for my first 4 years and it was great for what I wanted at the time.   

-"
"Lincoln Square: Where I live now, and I'm biased, but I think it's the best and I don't see myself leaving. Largely 30/40 somethings, more families, but feels like a small town within a big city. Also home to a bunch of awesome restaurants/bars/cute shops. Artsy. Live music in the square in the sunny months, community events very common and well attended. Further from downtown, but it's still easily accessible by train (probably an hour commute door to door on public transit). We have a 2BR for about 2k now.

-"
"Andersonville: Very LGBTQ friendly and centered. I'm a lesbian and my partner and I adore the area. It's one of two ""gayborhoods"" in Chicago, the other one being Boystown which is a part of Lakeview. If I were to stereotype, boystown is for younger energetic gays and andersonville is for the tired gays and lesbians. 

-"
"Really depends what you're looking for, but here are ones I'm most familiar with and could recommend:

"
"Edgewater: Right on the lake and very chill bar/restaurant scene. Definitely more 30+ crowd. Beautiful area and you really can't beat being so close to the lakefront with the beaches right there. Parking really sucks in this area though.

-"
"Rogers Park: I have a couple favorite bars in this area. It's catered towards 30+ and got a much more relaxed vibe as its farther north, but still has access to public transit to go south to other city things. Probably the best bang for your buck on this list in terms of cost - would likely move here if I got priced out of Lincoln Square. Close to Loyola so there are college folks, but it seems like a good community feel in the city from the time I've spent there. 

-"
"Sorry for the novel. I had the time so figured I'd type it out. There are other great neighborhoods that are further from public transit, but I don't go as much because I tend to use public transit as much as possible. My biggest piece of advice is to live near an el stop or a bus stop that gets you close to an el stop."
"Wicker Park: Don't know what age this swings these days, but I'd say its probably a good mix of 20s and 30s. I used to go here more often when I was younger - they've got a fun live comedy theater with some great plays and standup acts. Huge bar/restaurant scene, but imo on the bougier side compared to Lincoln Square. 

  
"
"Honestly not that bad, I’ve been told they used to be a lot worse but with climate change they have been more mild. I was most afraid of winters when I moved, but I don’t mind them at all anymore. There’s something cozy about being in a warm bar when it’s snowing. 

"
"For anyone considering, visit in Jan/Feb timeframe and see how you like it. It’s really cheap to be here then and if you like the city enough at that time, you’ll love it every other season of the year."
"Jobs do tend to pay a little more to offset cost of living, but I will say the state income tax is noticeable on salary coming from Texas.

"Yeah that's definitely the hardest part. I was able to make the move because I was traveling all the time for work back then, and they didn't care where I lived as long as I was near a major airport. I knew it was then or never for me, because there wasn't gonna be an easier time to make the move from a job perspective. Best of luck!"
"I’m moving home to Chicago soon, but I decided I’m just going to go and get a job when I get there. It’s so hard finding work right now regardless of where you are, and even harder when you’re trying to relocate.

San Diego is such a sleeper city!
Agreed but to be fair OC and the other places you mentioned are really Republican or at least Conservative leaning. Again I just want to point that out and I’m in no way a hardcore conservative or anything but that is something I observed in CA. It is very beautiful in California as a whole no doubt and hopeful I can return someday. I also lived in San Francisco which is arguably even worse than LA apart from a few very well of neighborhoods that are again very conservative. But to be fair San Diego is probably one of most beautiful places in the world so I don’t want to argue with you here at all.
