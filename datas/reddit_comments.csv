What fucking idiots left canopy's and trampolines outside to be gathered up by an impending hurricane/tropical storm?
Shopping cart sailing down a flooded street seems  like a legit good time.
Did people not see this coming. You’re not going to put away your patio furniture ahead of a hurricane?
"That’s not aftermath, that’s inthemath."
"""BeAmazed"" by some trash idiot out in Katy leaving his entirety backyard outside when having 2-3 days of prep time to put it in his garage. This storm wasn't that amazing folks. Minor fence damage, typical flooding in certain parts that always flood even during strong thunderstorms, older trees snapping/falling, etc. It was a weak cat 1.

What's amazing is the Texas government and Centerpoints incompetence. Our grid system fails when a mosquito farts on it."
"I mean, what did they think was going to happen with that tent?"
"oh man. there are going to be a lot of flood damaged cars and trucks on the market from texas. 

BEWARE!"
“Just look at that”
I have done cart sailing during hurricane wilma. 10/10 would recommend. 10/10 almost fucking died.
These people didn't prep for shit
You know what's amazing to me? How people still had their outdoor sun tents up as if they didn't realize a hurricane was coming.
01:00 the ~~boy~~ man who harnessed the wind.
I wonder how the water sweeper is doing?
"Okay, but like, these are not snapshots, and they are not aftermath. This is video, during."
Not the Academy pop up gazebo shade!
That guy in the grocery cart is making me anxious ah.
Why would you leave your tree outside? I would store my tree in my crawl space during a hurricane
"Meanwhile San Antonio is in stage 3 water restrictions. 

And it only rains enough to maintain humidity"
Will someone think of that poor smoker. Put a cover on it for crists sake. It’s gonna rust.
Damn insurance gonna go up again.
"You know there’s a massive storm coming. So, you leave all your shit out in your backyard.

Texan logic, I guess?"
"didn't Houston just have flooding in May, too?"
"It was a category 1 hurricane, not a tropical storm"
Just look at it
Was…was that girl sweeping the water away from her car?
It’s amazing how parking a few feet away makes a difference. Some cars flooded. Others looked fine
Still wonder why people are so adamant to live in Houston  … smh
"I keep hearing those religious folks asking for ""a sign from God"".....

Well with the frequency of devastating storms that'd been hitting the country of late I think y'all just ain't paying attention."
"State says “Please don’t drive, flooding will occur” Typical Texan “I’m driving through that puddle, I’ll be fine”."
Looks like normal climate…
Walking through deep water with downed power lines. This is how people die in hurricanes/flooding
Omg those poor patio cushions. How do I unsee???
Oh my a storm…we should all panic.
DamN
😻

"Trampoline made me laugh like... u KNEW there was a hurricane coming, right? Anyway, I hope my city rebounds quickly."
"![gif](giphy|SyqNMsyOJedWw)

Look at it"
"The lady sweeping water away from her car. 

When you don't know what else to do...

It's either that or kart surf."
"50% of these are just people being idiots. The giant flimsy canopy, the rotten flimsy fence and the unsecured trampoline all belong in that category."
"“Just look at it! Just look at it!” 

“I am MF!”"
"Not sure how long the storm took to get here. it here in my country a lot of times they cut the trees down to make them less of a wind catcher. Could've maybe helped here too. Too bad, looked like a beautiful tree!"
JUST LOOK AT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazed at their stupidity
The Texas BBQ remains intact
"Is this ai or an idiot? these are videos, not snapshots"
The man in the cart should go to Ekstensive for a better suspension.
The screeching eagle tho 🤣
My shopping cart guy was having a good time. I'm here for it.
"“Looks like it’s going to fly away or something…but…oh shit! It’s alright guys, I’m safe.” - Man with unsecured canopy and backyard littered with potentially deadly loose debris"
"Oh no a storm is coming, how bout we leave our shit OUTSIDE"
[deleted]
"There’s gonna be a lot of cars on sale from Texas. Y'all keep a lookout for them discounts. No accidents. Really. Water damage don’t count as accident, right?"
Gotta love flash flooding
The Star Spangled Banner music and eagle screech was a nice touch
It's because Texas is full of right wing sinners. God hates the GOP!
Drill Baby drill
"Hey honey, there's a hurricane heading right our way, can you take down the canopy on our patio??? "" Nah should be fine """
"Hurry, get your broom and sweep the water away from your cars!"
"I’m sorry but if you are showing me a video of a “disaster” that couldn’t even blow away Chad’s sun tent I’m under impressed by natures fury

Maybe move the car instead of complaining to Reddit about insurance rates"
They knew it was coming and yet they didn't move any of their stuff outside? Not the brightest bulbs and the lamp. And was she sweeping the water away from her car? 😆
"A hurricane is coming!! Well, I better leave this easily collapsible canopy up."
"Texas gotta be the worst state to live in, tropical storms and hurricanes, dust storms, tornados, blizzards, heat waves, what kinda natural disaster don’t they have??"
"Houston, we have a problem"
"The guy with the shopping cart.... Use the force, Luke!!!!! Use the force! 
🤣🤣"
The brooming of the water....hilarious
Friendly reminder. Driving through floodwater is only fun until your car breaks down and you become stranded or are forced to abandon your car.
Please come back!... that was funny
"It's not a hurricane in houston, unless you see someone sailing down the street with a tarp. Seriously, everytime."
It's god punishing Texas for continuing to put Republicans in charge.  /s
Beryl trying to teach Texans to not discriminate
"Seriously, if the water is gonna be that high, park the car in the front yard!"
That guy in the shopping cart 🤣
But keep voting Red and worrying about dumb shit like abortion.
"People naming storms: We need to be fucking serious about this people! Stop with the soft and silly names!

Also these people: We shall call it... Beryl"
Why it's called now a Tropical storm?
What the girl with the broom was trying to achieve?
Too funny
The shopping cart guy needs the pirates of the Caribbean music playing
The Prayers didn't help!
Shopping cart man has no direction. He goes where the wind takes him
Bruh that’s a Duringmath
lol did I see a woman trying to sweep away flood water that’s 8-12” deep
Is that girl sweeping the fuckin flood?!
Hhm I guess jamaica wasn't too bad
Thank god Ted Cruz is in Cancun!
I doubt this was category 1 like the Weather Channel mentioned. Seems like 2 or 3.
"My damn fences got destroyed, and my gazebo cover. This is too early in the season, too much time for it to happen again this year"
God is punishing the people of Texas for their errant ways
That ain’t shit I went thru Andrew and Wilma
"Gotta say, as someone who has flooded before, people driving around to record damage to post online should think about other people and the fukin big ass wave they are just sending into their homes, cars ECT. For a lot of people there's the difference between a few inches from road flooding to their doorstep so maybe not send a 2 foot wave into everyone's stuff and make shit worse. 

Okay rant over."
"That's only a topical storm right?


What happens when it's a real one?"
"Sweeping flood won't save your car, lady!"
"Honestly good. I'm sorry for yall, but the sooner the realities of climate change are shoved right down the throats of middle America,  the sooner climate action can accelerate without ignorant resistance."
That girl with the broom in the 3 feet of water wtf lol
Why was that person raking the water
Why is that dumbass sweeping the water?
Was more of a windstorm than a hurricane 🌀
"broad sweeping the flood water, smmfh"
Why was that lady pushing the water with a broom?
Was she seriously trying to move water with a RAKE??
That mf really trying to sweep water
To the one with the broom... What's the plan here?
[removed]
"My neighbor's gazebo flew over their fence onto my garage during mild wind in Pittsburgh. We are constantly worried about the structures he builds in his yard. Idiots like him are a dime a dozen. They skip the sand bags and permits to save themselves the hassle, too."
People who live in Houston actively choose a life of suffering.
The same kind of idiot that tries to sweep away flood waters
People are so inconsiderate…
Negligent idiots
Or that super nice grill
"Definitely idiots, but I do kinda wonder... Unless you have a huge garage or something where on earth can you store a trampoline that big? Can they even be disassembled?"
This. No sympathy with stupidity.
Texans
I mean one of them is literally sweeping water away from their submerged car
"….Texans.

Look at who they voted for to run their government.

Then are all Pikachu face when their infrastructure catastrophically fails because of one stormy boi."
"THIS and the girl literally sweeping the water away from her car 😂 Ma, bring me the dust pan!!"
beryl said fuck yo trampoline
My guess is they already know there is going to be an insurance claim filed so they’re planning to get paid for the trampoline they don’t want anymore and get new patio furniture since the old stuff got blown away.
I just set mine up to be a kite and just fly it as such.
But you didn't mention thr last trying to scoop away flood water with a shovel? Lol
"I more concerned with the person trying to sweep flood water away from their car.  Then again, it’s Texas and they aren’t exactly known for being the most intelligent state we have."
Texans
"Not the patio furniture!!!


Oh the huMANiteee!!!"
Americans :)
Exactly and move your damn car on the grass if its higher..and get bigger broom )
Word is he’s still sailing today.
I only looked through comments to find one about this part
Can’t believe that clip isn’t the hottest new meme by now
"Would you just look at that, look at it"
"Here for a good time, not a long time lol"
The song sail away by styx wasn't an actual call to go sail away guys
I legit went back and watched the video to find this part. Not disappointed and really want to try it myself.
Aren’t the sewers all overflowing into the water too?
I was gonna say has nobody seen the dexterity on this guy!? Hes crazy for that though.
That fucking tent for me.  What the fuck did they expect???
I mean it's been tearing through the Caribbean of the Gulf of Mexico for like a week and a half
"It was right after the 4th of July holiday. A lot of us travel that week to get out of the heat. I went on vacation the week before it hit. Only barely got back to prepare. Others may not have been able to. 

When I left and for half the trip it was not supposed to even come close to hitting Houston. 

There’s a pretty cool gif circulating around that shows the sudden northward movement it takes.   Basically every model had it wrong until about 48 hours from landfall. If you weren’t already heading back by then…"
"A lot didn’t take it seriously because it wasn’t projected to hit us at first. Not as immediately. 

They still should’ve had time to get their wind sails down"
people cannot be fucked to spend the 10 minutes it would take to pull the canvas off.
![gif](giphy|Bng9nsAhSaDVxWsSLh)
"Is there any change in the populations stance on utilities availability, or are people just not willing to reconcile that with their political views? Like yeah yeah, we get it, not gonna give up guns. But has there been any significant move towards correcting the way Texas provides utilities?"
"Also that tree has horrible root structure


But my guy floating down the street he’ll yeah"
Would you look at that?
"I would look at that, oh my, look at that...look at it, I would just look at it!"
"It's Texas, baby! It's in our DNA.

Which is why I fucking left lol."
"She trying to clear the drains which clog up with debris.  If can make a huge difference to local small scale rain induced flooding. 

Seems to me she a little late though"
She’s just doing her part
"Right. The aftermath is me sitting in my house that’s  probably 85° at 8:30pm rn, and have been sitting around all day when the heat index is 100+ and CenterPoint is showing that I should’ve had power yesterday. And my dog overheating last night and my gf having to drive 5 hours to get him to a safe area."
Thank you.
"I feel it. 

I also remember the time Houston was flooded af from a different storm while the PNW was on fire again. Really sucks that water couldn't've been moved in an economical fashion to help."
Ut was both it wasn’t cat 1 forever
I think she was trying to clear debris off a drain. I hope lol
"I wouldn’t be surprised. A lot of times when people have nothing to do in bad weather , they’ll get High af. The other day I smoked a fat joint in the car and left my car door opened afterwards because I forgot it was raining…"
One would think the crappy infrastructure crapping out that winter would've been a sign
"Nope, just a Cat 1. I live north of Houston."
Clearing a drain might help though
"Cleaning the drains. If they get clogged, water can't flow."
She's clearing the storm grate to help the water drain.
Sounds like a real jagoff
"From Houston, born and raised all my life (51 years).  Finally ready to tap out.  Fuck this shithole."
"I think she was trying to clear the sewer grate, but I got a laugh out of your comment."
"This is hilarious to me because that’s what we did in the Navy when it rained. Just sweep water off the ship and into drains which were completely useless placed in awkward places. 

I do _not_ miss those times."
That was my first thought. WHO the hell sweeps water??? I would be on the sideline encouraging her….. You’re doing great! I think you’re starting to make a dent ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)
A female Sisyphus.
Flip it upside down and add some tie downs to hold it in place.
Nope. That's how they come in the box.
They can be anchored down as well. 
"Well, you can take the parts that act like sails or kites off and roll them up. The framework is less likely to blow away. Just takes less laziness."
She was trying to clear the drains.  You would be amazed at how much flooding is caused by the drains being plugged with debris.
Did Abbot really skip town?
Let's vote them back into office to protect their self interests! Who cares whats best for me and my family.
"Supposedly he finally slowed down enough to jump off right outside Little Rock , Arkansas . Just what I heard.."
Ed Bassmaster... That clip of him with the car guy... Hilarious! Would you look at that! 🤣🤣
Same
Texas ranked 41/50 in most educated states…..
"It took an unexpected turn towards Houston in the last 24 hours, before that it was supposed to hit the Texas/Mexico border. Plus, a lot of people were away for the 4th. Most Houstonians don’t stay in town for the 4th."
That's pretty much what happened with Ike too. That shit was a clusterfuck.
"I have relatives in the Houston area and they literally made the comment ""and all of these poor areas think they deserve to get stuff for free. Just gimme gimme gimme.""

Not one of my relatives seem to acknowledge or care that their utilities are shit, and even if they did, they're of the staunch belief that not every human being deserves basic shit because they have to ""earn it."" These are the same people that think low income people don't deserve health insurance because they're ""druggies and have to earn the right to healthcare."" And when faced with the fact that I get government assisted healthcare, am low income, and am not a ""druggie,"" their response is that it's different.

Honestly, I don't get why people are so proud of that state. I've visited and even had to live in Texas for 9 months. Texas is nothing to write home about, especially how they treat their fellow man. There's a reason I call that state TexASS and will refuse to live there."
You don’t have to give up guns to interconnect Texas with other regional grids around it.
I wonder if it was a piece of shit cottonwood
"Yep, gets sprinkler water, if that."
![gif](giphy|ete9HLBYGmXIY)
The boy?
"Not too late. Had to do this during the eye of Irene back in 1999. The roads were as deep as she's in but we were able to get the streets to drain again before the other side of the eye hit. It all depends on if the rain is pooling due to debris or is the lake/creek that the drain empties into full. If it's the latter, you're screwed."
But she's not sweeping near the drain hole? It looks more like she's sweeping the surface of the water
Oh wow!!
"My friend,  I'm so sorry.  I'm a Florida girl, and Hurricane Ian was a fucking nightmare.  I wish I could offer you help. Just know, it sucks. It fucking sucks. Myself and my dog sweated/panted through some bullshit.  Ugh.  All I can say is, you'll fucking get back to normal.  But, it takes time and patience, and you will want to punch all the things. You'll get there, my friend.  And, if you need a bad joke, I got you.  ...all things are temporary...that's good, or bad.  Hell, I don't know."
"Started in the gulf as a tropical storm (just like every hurricane in history) and increased its category as it got worse. It was a cat 1 hurricane, not a tropical storm"
Oh wow. The Cat 1s I’ve experienced were far more mild.
He is! Threatened me with a hammer for putting his bucket back on his property when he first moved here. He tried to say it was my bucket lol He hates women per his social media page. He's married with two little girls. The guy already had the neighbors on both sides of him move after run-ins with him. Guy is a ticking time bomb.
"It’s pretty funny how judgey people are when they dont even know what that person is doing! “What a moron, who tries to save their car!?”"
A buddy of mine in the navy used to tell me stories of having to mop up the rain if he fucked up on something stupid
"I mean it looks like she has a net of some kind to me. Maybe she's trying to keep leaves and sticks and shit away. 

I dunno, whatever she's doing is fucking futile either way."
Lmfao.
He can’t skip anything
"Lone Star state? 

More like 1 star state"
It sounded like it was from Reno 911
She using a rake and the water is only ankle deep.
"Unfortunately this is the second time in 2? Months. I’m fine. I can take it. I have friends with power I can go to but 90% of my neighbors left and someone needs to watch their houses as much as I/We (my bad ass neighbor who roughed it out with me last time) can. My GF and Dog are safe so are my neighbors. I’m okay! 
I have a gas stove and water heater, can shower/cook. My job had power so I can get ice from them to keep food and beer (lots of beer :’)) cold."
"In Florida. Last time my city took a direct hit I was only a day or so without power (if that) because I was on the same grid as a blood center, which was literally next door.

Otherwise, while the local utility is almost unreasonably expensive, it gets the ""almost"" qualifier because so long as you're within city limits, they get the power back on pretty fast."
"Sometimes the gutters get clogged with debree, and trash bags. So if you get out there and remove it, you can avoid flooding in the street."
"I mean, does she think all the grates are just blocked? No amount of grate clearing is going to save shit at that point, the system is already full and can't keep up."
JFC
He done rolled up out of there.
"Ugh. My friend.  I get it.  During hurricane season, I'm on edge.  Will my family survive? Will my house survive? Will my insurance pay for repairs?...NOPE.  Anyway, I hope y'all get through it.  And, if a reddit homie can do anything,  let me know."
Thank you it really means a lot. All my people are good so as long as I can keep keeping on like I have we’ll see the end. No damage thankfully. Just a big fuck CenterPoint
No in fact in Texas they can fire you for no reason whatsoever as well
You can file an emergency unemployment if they do not pay for them days
Got laid off during the middle of it with no electricity after 12 years of service. These mf’s don’t give a fuck about you.
Are you an hourly (non-exempt) or salaried (exempt) who worked a partial week of your regularly scheduled work week?
"Lol, you think you have worker protections in Texas?  Oh, I have some bad news for you."
If you are hourly you should be able to appt for disaster unemployment.
Our company has a code “natural disaster” that we used for our non exempt employees so they can get paid during this time without power.
"My job is still powerless too. It's a hotel also - you'd think they'd have prioritized getting its power up. Sadly, the huge luxury apartment complex across the street also still doesn't have power. I just know those people are FURIOUS because those apartments are not cheap."
Not necessarily. Depends on any contract you have.
"Right to Work State FTW 🙌🏽 /s

Your employer has no obligation to pay you due to power outages! If they do, be thankful. If they don’t, I would look for employment somewhere else."
Thank you
I’m hourly
"It was a question 
No need to be sarcastic about it"
Like 6 years ago when I worked for a grocery store chain managing inventory they didn’t want us working during the holidays because we got in people’s way so we had a lot of November and December off and someone told me about underemployment and I filed for it and got it without any hassle except for a quick phone call. There are some worker protections in Texas.
Is there a state that does require employers to pay during power outages?
"\*At-Will. Right to Work deals with unions. 

But yes, they do not have to pay you, OP. As someone else mentioned, you *may* be able to file for temporary unemployment. [https://www.twc.texas.gov/programs/unemployment-benefits/disaster-unemployment-assistance](https://www.twc.texas.gov/programs/unemployment-benefits/disaster-unemployment-assistance)"
Right to work… for less!
"Hourly employees are paid for actual hours worked. Unless you have PTO or other paid benefits that cover absences, usually, you are not paid for time off. Your employer has the option to pay you for the time off but is not obligated. Check your employee handbook to see if your company has a policy on office closures due to inclement weather."
This state makes me sarcastic.
"Texas is both At-Will and Right To Work.

Just clarifying for the passer-bys."
Good Reddit users give links for help!
Thank you!
True hate it here
Were you on the schedule during those days and have proof? Disaster unemployment.
Second that
"Is “disaster unemployment” available in Texas? 
What is the criteria for being eligible?"
Thirded.
"Heights (77008) - no power since the storm hit. A lot of big trees came down on roads, houses, and cars. As of last night, several streets fully impassable and that’s just in the couple blocks we walked around

Update as of 2:30pm: still without power

5/18 7pm: still no power, but lots of electric trucks spotted today! Near 9th&yale and along MKT trail

Hopefully final update 5/19 7:50pm: I’m at work, but I’m told we just got power!"
Reporting in for my boss over in 77079. has emailed me 6 times since 6:14 am. They definitely got power over there.
"77064 Jersey Village area, no power since about 6:30PM. I have not driven around but my sense is that most homes and businesses nearby are without power as well."
"77092, Oak Forest 290/ W43rd. No power since about 7 last night. Phone signal in and out"
77429 off of Jones and Grant. Cypress North Houston towards 290 seemed to have power as of 8pm last night same goes for the corner store at Grant and Jones and the McDonald’s near there. They seemed to have power so if they’re open that’s some food for anyone nearby. Currently still do not have power but at 3:20am we had a short surge of power before it went off again. Nothing since.
Salute to the Linemen working hard to get the power back on after the storm! We appreciate you guys!
"77433, Cypress. My neighborhood doesn't have power. But a few exits down on 90, there is power. 

We've been out of power now 12 hours. Do we trash everything in the fridge?"
77055- Spring Branch/ Afton Village Neighborhood. No power since 6:45 last night. Tree down on Antoine and all around. Most neighbors have moved trees so neighborhood roads are passable.
"77056/galleria uptown, I was woken up about 15 mins ago by lights and AC cranking on, we have power after almost 12 hours. Never lost water.

Edit: we lost power again but it came back on"
290 near Tidwell rd. has no power
"77024, no power and low water pressure"
"Independent Heights; No power since about 6:40. Pitch black over here

Update: 3:15 pm- still no power
Update: 3:21 pm- power restored"
"77035, no damages that I know of. We got lucky that we only got the tail of the storm, so we only got 30 mins of bad weather"
77008 heights still no power
"Centerpoint's [Outage Tracking web site](https://gis.centerpointenergy.com/outagetracker/index.html) IS working (at least it is for me) but takes almost a full minute before the numbers finally populate.

At 9:49 AM Friday, [727,691 customers without power.](https://i.imgur.com/138hHlD.jpg)  

I expect CenterPoint will get crews in from all across the state - it's going to take a LOT of people and equipment to get the power back on for everyone.

It's pretty impressive that the wind was strong enough to take out several of the big power-line towers.  Even hurricanes have never caused that much [damage to those structures.](https://i.imgur.com/51Ce8R4.jpg)"
77084 still no power since yesterday. Right now I don't really care but starting tomorrow we are getting summer heat days so that is concerning. Praying for power to be restored sometime tomorrow
[deleted]
"Grapevine, but reliable info.  The high tension lines that are down on the NW side will be a VERY long project, not measured in mere days.  That's the bad news.  The good news is Centerpoint put a plan in action that will have crews coming in from all over to literally build a set of temporary electric substations to reconnect big swaths of the service area comparatively very quickly.  At last report, Centerpoint has already restored service to about 300,000 points."
"Brit here travelling around Texas. Houston is our last stop. Was staying in a sky-rise Airbnb in the Rice Neighbourhood. That shit was crazy. Sirens were going off on my phone (we don’t get that in the UK!), power went out and then the downtown buildings disappeared in the black sky.

In our shared experience, can I be anointed as an honorary Houston-citizen?

Hope those still without power get back on soon. Stay safe everyone!"
"Who has cell service? I've never experienced zero cell reception/data for almost 24 hours in Houston before. I switched to AT&T 2 months ago and my wife is furious, convinced that Verizon would still be working. The only reason I can read/post this is because I connected the home internet to our generator.

Edit: as if 8PM, AT&T 5g has been working much better for me for the last 1.5 hours (77092)"
77011 no power since 6:30 but I think I hear power trucks nearby. There's a shell like down the block so I might walk down there to see if they have power or at least some ice when the sun comes up.
77007.  No water or power.  Anyone else still not have water?
77449 no power since 6:30.  Across from us has power and people I know within a 2-5mile area have power
"77450 - lost power around 6pm last evening, still no power. We do have water though

Edit: as of 5:20pm, we have power!"
"77447, no power yet, going insane. Taking care of my fully dependent bedridden nonverbal mother with no power is rough"
"77065. No power and news says we are probably screwed for at least half a week. I drove to willis and the Loves truck stop there is open and clean for a $20 shower for those who need it. IMO its worth it. I spent 20 mins in there and felt way better after since i had to do some major repairs on my animal enclosures after the storm (everyone is okay) The Loves also have 32ct water for about $10. The Loves down 290 is CLOSED due to a sign being felled on power lines. I was lucky enough to stock up on wet cat food (friskies) and 9lives dry cat food before the storm, so if someone needs a couple of cans lmk but give me a couple hours to respond as i dont have well enough power supply to be constantly online. 

Most if not all of conroe has power. I was over near Mezcal and the HEB thats near there is open. As with the walmart and many other amenities and restaurants. Gas up in conroe is roughly 2.92-3.16"
"I'm in 77012.

No power,  internet comes and goes.  Jack in the box on Harrisburg has power... it's going to be slammed."
"River Oaks and Greenway Plaza has power/ gas/ food etc.  The Whole Foods on Kirby is open (not that I shop there but saw it).  The gas station on Washington is open (on Shepherd).  Shepherd Walgreens near Allen Parkway looked to have power as well.

  
Timbergrove is shit.  TC Jester to 11th is a nightmare, trees all down all over 77008 but not the Heights-Heights area.  Entire trees blocking the roads, but I did see two tree trimming trucks this morning there.  Also saw a Centerpoint crew on E TC Jester this morning 7 AM. 

  
Hope this helps someone looking for gas/water/food."
77035. None of my neighbors lost power at any point. Had no idea the extent of the damage until I saw on socials that we were spared from the worst of the storm. Feeling very lucky and grateful. Hope yall are doing okay
"77095 near barker cypress and 529, still no power.  Gonna go stay with in laws tomorrow if this keeps up, the heat is coming"
77003 East End no power since last night.
77007 next to St Thomas High School and still no power.  Not looking good
"77006 Montrose - power came back at 436am - Cucharita’s, Barnaby’s, Katz’s all open, people having breakfast - on dog walking route saw not much damage except a tree down on Whitney next to Osaka "
77065 (jersey village/cypress) - been out since 6:30 yesterday - got power back minutes ago.
"77429, no power as of 6:10pm.

For people who are really wanting a hot meal, a/c, necessities -- Bellaire Blvd. (Chinatown) was open with power - groceries, restaurants, tea shops as of 4pm."

"77433 - Creekland @ 99/290 power back on.

Saw the tornado forming in the field behind our development before running in the house. I was a small multi-vortex that got wrapped in rain within 20 seconds of it touching down. I got stuck in the garage because of the pressure from the wind pushing against the house door. Just glad to have power back after seeing the damage it did to the transmission lines in our easements."

"77006, Montrose, right along the Westheimer curve. Still no power since 18:30 yesterday, but so much stuff around us is on!"
"Mods: can we have a seeking help/advice thread sorted by new? 

I need to find a hotel room for a friend with a baby and no power and everywhere I’ve called either a) has no vacancy, b) doesn’t pick up (maybe no power)

Does anyone know of a reasonably priced hotel with power that’s safe for a single mom with a baby? It’s too hot for a baby to sleep in this."
"77084 near Hwy 6 and I-10 - power went out yesterday but came back quickly. Wind blew down some trees and a few power lines. Haven’t left the house since coming home yesterday, as a downed tree in my apartment parking lot prevented my going to work. Currently pouring rain AGAIN."
77003 has power. Except the grid with my house on it. There’s an entire tree in 3 transformers. They have it taped off but no progress yet.
77023/ Second Ward area just got power back not to long ago around 5:40am. We hadn’t had power since yesterday at 6:40pm. We always had water.
"77004- power is on, plenty of trees in the streets, on cars, quiet outside this morning. A lot of damage between Durham and 16th heading down to med center."
"Spring Branch, 77055. Trees literally knocked down power lines last night. Not expecting power until Monday, if I'm being honest.

Still out. Looks like Ike. I have small kids and we said fuckit and went out of town. Gonna be hot tomorrow. No thanks.

I'm tired. Too many catastrophic weather events, and hurricanes are starting next month. It's getting hot. It gets so fucking hot."

[deleted]
77005 - West U.  Never lost power.  All good.  Hope everyone gets restored soon.
">!77546, Friendswood/Webster area.!< What sucks is that the vast majority of people in my general area aren't affected, so schools and jobs are still going like nothing's happened and haven't addressed it, when our neighborhood has been completely in the dark since 7:20 PM yesterday. Waking up with the power still out was demoralizing to say the least, big RIP to all the ice cream I bought yesterday 🥲"

"Katy (77450) - power's been out since the start of the storm since about 6pm last night. Supposedly it came on for about a minute at 3am then went right back off. So fridge is definitely gone :(


Friend of mine said his apartment is flooding near downstream from the Barker, so if you have property there call your neighbors and check in. 


Also if any of yall have a renters or homeowners policy, check your policy papers carefully. Supposedly according to another redditor some policys will have an exemption for spoiled food from power loss and will not make you count that toward deductable."

77429 Cypress. Power still out and ours literally never goes out ever.
"77007, north of Washington, but south of I10. Tree limbs down but powerlines appear undamaged. No power since storm hit (unless it came back briefly overnight and I slept through it.) Power failed in a series of flickers and brownouts- seemed like the grid was attempting to compensate. Internet connectivity via cell network is spotty- sometimes it works, and sometimes not. We still have water, but I'm filling some jugs just in case."
77007 has no power as of 10:16am. Assuming nearby businesses also have no power.
"montrose 77006 — no power since storm last night, but water is fine. i’m going to sugarland where my mom lives until the powers back, which i suspect won’t be anytime soon"
77449- I guess we’re lucky cause our power came back on at about 5am and has been on ever since. My brother drove around the neighborhood and said a lot of people around here still don’t have power and are just chillin outside so no idea how the grid works around here.
77040 no power since 6:30pm. We’re averaging 2 outages a month so I fear we’ll be the last to get power back.

Some tree limbs (or half trees) down here and there, but nothing blocking the main roads that I saw, no real flooding. We were without power for about 8 hours but I guess it was an easy fix."
77070… our lights came on for about an hour but just powered back off again 😭

"77433/Cypress, I live in the new Bridgeland section just behind 99. I was caught in the worst of the storm on the HOV on 290 yesterday, thought i was going to die. Power has been out since about 6pm and hasn’t come back, but we’ve got wifi and our fridge + freezer operating on a generator for now."
"77080 at Blalock and kempwood, no power since the storm hit last night but fortunately still have water. Went for a drive and trees are down everywhere, as far as I can tell power is out for a good 2-3 mile radius. Huge line at Kroger at gessner and hammerly, didn't check kempwood heb. Saw a few taco trucks with generators running with massive lines 😂"
Anyone know of any hotels open near downtown or hobby airport
"Those of you with solar panels and in outage areas, please let me know if y'all get power from those panels. My mom wants to know.

Also, 77084 here, still no power as of 5/17 at 5:53 PM"
"Cypress Station, 77090. I don't know if Spring is in yall's radar but we had our power out for awhile, just came back on a few hours ago. Flooding ain't that bad though."

77493 No power since the storm. Xfinity internet was working immediately after the storm but has been off since Thurs night.
Is it true that living close to a hospital protects you during outages like this? I used to be in 77018 by Memorial North and chilled through Rita. Now I’m in 77082 by HCA West and same deal. Makes me want to plan my moves very wisely. 
77007 no power since 6:35pm

ETA: if anyone has info on what's going on at the humane society on almeda/beltway 8 please share, i have cats in boarding there and I'm concerned for their safety.

Correction, target has power."
"Anyone else have power but no internet? Oddly enough, had internet during the storm and just after but went offline early this morning around 5am.

Very happy the lights are on at least, but I’m annoyed with the lack of communication from Xfinity. I’ve heard exactly nothing from them all day. Usually I’d receive a text message or something with an update or estimated time of service restoration. I assume their facilities are having power issues, but it would be nice to know a detailing of the situation so I can plan accordingly."

Just drove from Rice Military to Sugar Land. Trees and branches down in the River Oaks area.

I don't see any wind damage at all where I work in SL"

Wondering if it’s worth venturing out on the roads to get to the office, but fearful of all the morons out on the roads. I tried to venture out for food last night and turned around because people were driving like absolute maniacs and blowing through every intersection since the lights were all out- even with all the road debris."
"77004 - Southmore & Emancipation, never lost power or internet"
"77007, near Memorial, no power since 6:30pm, have a video of it going out when the transformer blew. No running water since we’re on a higher floor, got bottled water from the Walmart on Yale last night.

Never lost power, no serious damage to any nearby properties.

Internet/phones at work stayed up until a little after 9 this morning (Friday).  Logix Communications (fiber data) facility on Cutten Road was on battery backup but batteries finally gave out.

Had to forward our phones to a cell phone, and used our cell phones as WiFi hotspots to connect our PCs to internet for email, etc.

The boss decided to close down early and we went home around 3 PM."

"77058 - never lost power, I share a grid with JSC & a bunch of hospitals though. Ironically JSC did lose power last night but that was apparently because of a raccoon (rip). Everything down here is open, just some branches in the road. I haven’t seen like, damage or anything."

Temperatures gonna be feel like 100 soon with no ac, make sure everyone stays hydrated and to hang or put on damp clothes or towels if it gets too much. Gonna be a rough few days"

"77018 - Oak Forest - Lost power as the storm passed around 6:40 last night. Water is still on numerous large trees have falled all over the neighborhood. Large pine blocking my street entirely. Some trees have fallen on homes. Visible damage to overhead power lines, may are laying in yards. Its going to take many days/weeks I would guess to get all the power on and clear all the trees, just not enough linemen and arborists to clean up.  
If you guys know of a gas station near Oak Forest with gas, please let me know."

Trees down, Valley Oaks Gate ripped away. Construction boards were everywhere in the streets. Areas are flooded...trees are in people's roofs. The whole area is without power and it's looking to be a week or two in darkness.."

In Tomball no power but got the last generator at home Depot last night!! Good luck stay safe 😎
"77009 - East Montrose: No Power in patchy areas.  No power for me from 6:30 pm until 4:30 am when power was restored.  Thankfully I have a standby generator which automatically kicked in, so the whole house was powered the A/C and all, including internet. Phew!"

"Had to drive into work at 610 and Memorial to get my laptop and other critical items. Memorial has a good deal of trees down, but is largely passable. There isn't a light on from the Memorial exit off 45 north to Woodway drive. Some of the tree debris has clogged culverts and there is pooling water in a few places."
"Huge tree down on Lockwood between Canal and Navigation, pulled a big line down with it so 77011 is going to be without power for a while (unless you were lucky and aren’t connected to that line)."

Getting slammed at kirby and weassstiner

Anyone have power in 77040?
"77055 - Pine Chase Dr. Lots of trees down and power out since Thursday. This is absurd. This year is election year, and it does not matter if you are Red or Blue, we all need to embrace each other and make a change. This is not acceptable. VOTE FOR ME and I will make my priority. I am not into politics, BUT will get into it if needed. #HoustonStong"
"I live in Sugar Land, living life as usual. We were lucky down here."
Same over in the 09 side of the Heights.

Also 77008. Sitting at HEB charging my phone. They're the only place with power.
77008 also but in Shady Acres - Power came back on at midnight last night. It appears to be 22nd and north. 21st and South is still without power.
[deleted]
I’m in 77008- no power here. I’m going to have to get my car out of the garage and start hunting down fuel for the generator soon. Going through my supply very quickly
"77008 here (24th near Durham). We lost power around 6:30PM last night, and we still don’t have power. We do have water, thankfully.

ETA: As of 6:45PM on Saturday 5/18, we have power and wifi!"

In the woodland heights (Near the Taylor exit). We got power back around 3 am (best guess based on my clocks currently reading 6:30).
"I live in 77009 but I'm out of town. Having to worry if my place got buttfucked by a storm when I'm traveling is getting old, Houston."

In the heights by TC Jester & my apartment still doesn’t have power :/

Just got power back on 24th and Bevis!
"009 here, nothing yet"
"I work off of 12th and the only reason our main office was open was because we have back up generator. Major damage to our warehouse (mostly its doors that roll up). Two doors down an empty freight trailer had blown on its side. All wooden fencing we had dividing us between the daycare next door’s playground blew down.

When I left at 5PM, no power still. Those who had an AT&T cell provider did not have service the whole day."
Still no power as of today. Yall?
Looks like I'm going to work then. Thanks stranger.
I'm at 77079 and we don't have power
"Also in the 77079, no power. Seems like only partial outage in the area."
He could be charging his phone in my car.
Not all of it. Some buildings do have power but most homes are out
Same in 77040
Live in 065 power is still out other than people with generators.
Same at 77095. No power in the traffic lights and some parts have a bunch of debris.

My work in that area (around Eldridge and West Little York) emailed early this morning to say the building still had now power.

"Just went down Antoine a few hours ago looking for open gas stations and it was a shit show. Was about to give up and started heading home down tc jester. Luckily  the shell at tidwell and tc only had one car at each pump. 

Got both my 5gal gas cans and my tank filled up. I'm expecting 2-3 days before we see any power again. 🤷🏼‍♂️"
Yep! Right around there too and no power since last night
Been calling all the power companies with no answer thinking may be a few days before power
Any idea when power will be restored?
Any idea when power will be restored?
"Turn your AC off if you haven't already. If you can't, turn it off at the breaker box."
"Update: Jones road is almost completely off. From Grant all the way till Steeple Park heading towards 290 is out. From Steeple Park till 290 there are lights on but only gas stations are open. The light at 290 and Jones is also out. Checking 1960 now. Also there is a gas station on Cypress North Houston close to Jones that is open if you need ice or gas

Edit: this was recorded as of 7:30 am on May 17th"
Ok so I wasn't crazy? I was in the bathroom in the middle of the night and swore the lights flashed for a second but doubted myself cause I haven't slept a wink.
Update 2: lights and businesses from Jones to 1960 on 290 are open and have power. 1960 is strange though. There are places that have power but the lights are out. There are stores that are open closer towards 290 on 1960 but most are closed. Also for clarification by lights out I mean completely off. I’ve only seen 1 set of blinking red lights at 290 and 1960 all other lights that I’ve mentioned are completely turned off. There are long lines for Burger King and McDonald’s at 1960 and 290 but they are open and have power as of 7:40 am May 17th
Grant and Louetta has spotty power but we’ve been out since 6:30 yesterday. Say about 6 utility trucks near Hamilton elementary so hoping we get it restored soon.
77429 at Huffmeister and Barker Cypress. Power has been out since the storm hit. All traffic lights completely out as well. Lots of branches and fences down.
How do the homes look in 77429?
Update 4: We have power at my place now! As of 3:30 pm we have power back. This is off of Jones and Grant.
yes unfortunately
"77433 also, Barker Cypress and 529. Still no power as of 30 minutes ago. I'm at my parents house in 77449 now and they've had power since a little before 5am."
Same here. Came back for a few minutes at 4am before going again.
"77433, at the front of Bridgeland at Bridgeland Creek and Fry.

No power as of 6:20 Thursday. ATT says we have Internet but I can't verify. Cell service has been fine.

Bought a bunch of chicken and milk literally yesterday I am gonna have to trash."
you still have time to transfer it to a cooler and ice it.
"Start cooking if you can. We used a gas grill, outside obviously, during the freeze as an oven. It worked pretty well. Made frozen pizzas. I’m about to do some frozen salmon for dinner if the power stays off."
"FM529 and 99 stoplight is on, but east of that nothing. Major damage in the neighborhoods around here, thankful that we just lost a few shingles."
Can confirm no power over by logenbaugh and greenhouse. Been down since just before the worst mess hit at 630. No problems with water.
How about now? We are just behind HEB and have power
West side of Gessner seemed to have some power. But to the east of Gessner it was dark as far as I could see down I-10 at 5am.
"77080, Spring Branch here, East side of Gessner. Got hit hard, trees on neighboring houses everywhere. No power since yesterday at 6:30 like everybody else"
I'm on Westview near Valley Oaks Elem...u think there will be a boil notice? Last night was really scary and I've been helping move branches within my apartments
Same. At Westwood & Wirt. No power since 6:45pm yesterday. No cell service. Been driving to I-10 & Gessner to get cell service and charge phones.
My grandmother lives in that neighborhood! Hope her neighbors would help if needed. I can't talk to any of my family there because I guess cell service is down. 😭
"This gives me hope, 77057 here and still dark"
"I don’t live there, but could you let me know when you get power back? I have friends there that I can’t reach."
"Glad you have power. I’m right by you in Tanglewood, so I hope we’re back on soon."
Thanks for sharing. My elderly parents are in 056 and I can’t get in touch with them. Suspect they’re still asleep but hadn’t seen any coverage of the Galleria high rises so this update is very much appreciated. Fingers crossed…
It's safe to expect more power blips as they connect more people to the grid. Coming up on 18 hours without power in 77007. RIP refrigerators.
I was at the galleria about an hour before it happened. I was literally sitting on the curb next to the oyster bar waiting for my Uber home. Do you think there will be a boil notice? I'm in 77055 Spring Branch.
anyone know if any gas stations are open near the galleria? haven’t ventured out yet
All the gas stations are out around there too? Need some gas
"77024 near Gessner and Memorial, no power either but fine on the water"
"We're right by the mall, to the Southeast. Only had the power flicker off a bit during the storm. Been solid since."
77024 near 610. Same situation on power and water. Two trees fell in front of our apt and blocking half the street
Was told there would be no power in this area for potentially a couple weeks. I live right next to the Marq-E. My job is also in this area so they will notify me once it’s back on
I'm probably a few blocks away from you. Do you have water? Our pressure is super low
Glad to find the one other person with a TSU flair lol
Any word on power coming back?
Any word on power coming back?
No joke if I didn’t check social media I’d assume that this storm was just a weird quirk. Walked by Hillcroft @ West Bellfort last night and things look pretty good aside from a few small branches
"I’m in same area code and somehow have lost power sometime after I went to bed last night, likely after midnight. Makes no sense"
"Yup, in 77096 it was just some heavy rain. We are very fortunate."
I haven’t even seen a centerpoint truck up here. Nothing. I could throw a rock and hit people with power but we’ve been out 26 hours
"I asked but they have no ETA at all for anything, I asked as well since thats where I am too."
"Was talking to a buddy of mine who works with electrical and responds to these types of events, he was tellin me houston’s ass backwards with how they tackle these situations:( hope yall stay safe though. Hopeful for tomorrow!"
It would be really helpful if they let people know which zip codes they are prioritizing. It would help people plan.
The website seems to be overloaded
I’m praying for y’all as well. I got relatives in the area and it’s so worrying the power hasn’t come back. Inshallah by tomorrow’s end there’s power. Hang in there friend.
Yep hasn’t worked for a bit
Can you be specific in terms of landmarks? Below/above  290? Along Hwy6?
Northwest is huge. Where are you talking about specifically? 
"I have read many responses that the restoration of the downed high tension lines was benchmark for  regaining power. it seemed possible but my wishful thinking assumed alternate shortterm options were being used. It's good to hear. 
  "
the fact that you went through that and still want to be one of us is evidence enough that you're crazy enough to be a houstonian.
As a traveler and to have experienced spastic weather of that magnitude automatically makes you a Houstonian in my opinion. Welcome! Lol.
You’re in. The secret password is >!Feeder Road!<
You're anointed and have a key to the city🥰
"I’ve lived here basically my entire life and this is easily one of the craziest weather events I’ve experienced. Sorry it had to happen on your trip, but I guess you got a story to share when you get back home! Stay safe and enjoy the rest of your trip! "
You’re a fellow Houstonian for experiencing this bizarre freak storm in our book. Hope you’re able to get back home safely.
"This was some Harvey level event.  You got the authentic Houston experience.

Side note, we are going to London this year.  I used to live there but haven’t been in 20 years.  Have things changed safety wise for touristy things there? "

"As a native Houstonian, I grant you special Houstonian privileges. Your next level up will be hunkering down in a hurricane."
You're official. You have all the rights given to Houston locals by our FREEDUMB leadership.
Scurvy redcoat!  Just kidding...we'll give you a Houston membership card!
Verizon has been spotty in several areas of Houston for us.
I have Verizon in spring branch and it’s been solid throughout the storm. My xfinity has been down the whole time so we’ve been tethering to our PCs without any issues.
"I was really struggling with T-Mobile throughout the morning, but it's been back to normal after like 2pm for me (77007)."
"AT&T is having a national wide issue with their service, what’s going on here isn’t helping at all.

For what it’s worth, all the carriers are struggling right now in Houston. Some areas work better for others right now, and is also carrier specific."
"Hi neighbor! Magnolia park is getting power back, so I’m hopeful navigation will too."
I'm in 77011 as well. Our power finally came back on about 30 minutes ago. So hopefully yours will come back on soon. It's been quite a night!
"77011 also, still no power since last night but saw some lights on at Lockwood and Canal"
77011 as well - power came back on around 5:30a - tree down behind us and lots of debris - but generally everything else is ok.

"Thanks for the post! In timergrove, but haven’t driven around yet. Definitely no power at all here with all the trees and lines down."
"I’m in same area code and somehow have lost power sometime after I went to bed last night, likely after midnight. Makes no sense"
"Thats our zip code.  Unfortunately, there’s a tree on our power line.  Unhappiness!"
"My parents are near west and hwy 6 and they just got power back, I hope you get as lucky."
"Same, will probably head to Austin to stay with in laws before the 90 degree weather hits. went out last night and this morning, the only place with power and open was Walmart on 529. The McDonald’s inside had a huge line. Ended up going north on hwy 6 this morning and everythhing past huffmeister was open though."

Lucky!! No power near Menil
No power near Tiger Market still.

castle ct is effed
We got power today around 2pm! Have you?
"Some assholes always blame the victims because if it's the victims fault, then the assholes feel safe from disaster because "" they aren't stupid enough to let that happen to them."""
"Why shouldn't they blame it on us, just like the winter storm? Aren't we all one hivemind that thinks and votes alike?"
"Sounds about right. What's funny is that we know the majority that truly feel that way are in-between cities. Inside the cities it's more of a different story, lol.

Seeing people mock Texas because we ""couldn't handle the cold and are pussies"" during the winter storm are just ignorant POSs. Not like anyone here could control anything, lol."
77055 no power…barely any cell service with verizon
Power restored @8pm (behind the HEB on Bunker Hill)
"I’m at Westview and Voss, no power yet."
"What part of Spring Branch are you in? We're at 10 and Campbell and in a hotel, hoping to come home tmrw 🤞🏻"
Wirt & Westview- no power.
I’m 77429 near Barker Cypress and 290 still no power.
Lakewood forest?
Found something! But thread may still be helpful
Sugarland has availability.
is that near the reservoir?
"77003 here, me and my whole hood are still out"
Would love any updates if they start doing any work! Thanks!!
"I am also in second ward and currently have no power, but you have given me hope!"
Also 77023 - still no power. Friends up the street have power though.
"Yeah, I’ve been in Houston for a very long time and I think I’m done. Houston infrastructure can’t handle someone sneezing much less a 30 minute power storm. I think this one made my mind up about leaving."
"Don't open your fridge, it'll be good for at least a day."
Depends how long this last. You have a good 2 days without opening the fridge
We're in the same boat. Good luck!
They are opened. My company actually dropped off product to them this morning
This guy knows how to weather a power outage ^
I have friends around Link and Walton that got it back yesterday evening.
"It went out, and is still out, in other parts of West U."
"I'm also 77005, but our block lost power."
Never lost power either
I’m 77546 as well and never lost power. Hope it gets turned back on soon for you!
Why does that suck that most people weren’t affected?
Same here! I’m just a few blocks from the HEB on west Alabama’s and looks like they have power
"Still no power, but the whole foods have power and look like they're going to open. 

Looks like there's power along laugh.

Lots of branches down, but the streets look clear for the most part."
77006 no power no water
"same same, yet the streets around me have power"
As on noon today we have power and water just north of Westheimer on Pacific street
"06, no power, have water too. Seems like stuff around me has power but I’m not sure what the pattern is. Fix coffee has power on Westheimer if anybody needs caffeine this morning. "
77003 Sherman near Paige we just got power back about a half hour ago.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I'm a couple blocks south of Patterson and I-10. Power was out for approx. 20 min last night. Cellular has been off/on though.
"Fuuuck.  So they're no longer in the area?  I live in 77013 near 610 and Wallisville.  The power is back (as of around 7) right down the street from me right around 610, but no luck in my neighborhood."
Not all of it just like that one bit too. I’m going insane.
lights were on south of Washington yesterday and someone just said lights came on at the farmer's market just north about an hour ago. Fingers crossed its soon for 77007!
77066 here - we lost power 😭
Also 77066. We had flickering but never lost power. Our power had gone out a few weeks ago overnight night so we think whatever repairs they made at that time bolstered things.
I'm in the same area and the same thing happened to us. 
Update: power is back on
"Yep, we had the same thing happen to us in 77007"
77004- McGowan and Crawford still out. Saw a CP truck at Austin on McGowan around 5pm-ish. Hoping tomorrow will be on...
77375 off three lakes has power. restored earlier this afternoon. sorry to hear you’re still out :(
[deleted]
"Didn’t follow your own post guidelines 😂

Hope you and yours are safe! 🙏🏽"
"Depends on which part, pretty much no power where it hits 59 east Tex"
610 north or south
Still I figured...
"Are there any areas over here where we can go to? Like a bookstore or maybe the whole foods near by? I'm on Westview, near Valley Oaks elementary...there's a tree down right beside my complex... actually..all around my complex there are trees down..no power..nothing"
Hi neighbor. We have no power and no cell service. At my parents house now charging phones and checking the news since we’ve been in the dark (literally) since last night .
Last night we had to drive to wherever we could see functional street lights and figured they had power. Went to a gas station on I-10 and Kirkwood
"Gulfgate area has power all over, not that specific but hope it’s close enough for you"
"I drove from Oak Forest to Washington to Westheimer looking for gas.

The Chevron at I-10 & Washington/Wescott had power this afternoon"
Thank you! 🙏🏻
"77004 - Alabama & Ennis, power has been out since around 6:40 PM last night. Water is fine. Centerpoint shows a ton of outages in the area so you are lucky!"
"77004 - near southmore & almeda, power flickered a lot last night but haven’t lost it "
"Damn, I'm right across Gessner in 77043. I think we'll be one of those neighborhoods that takes days to get it back, tons of downed trees. Spring Branch got the strongesg portion of the winds from the storm along with Cypress and Jersey Village"
Have any idea when power might be restored? The centerpoint outage tracker is useless with providing any updates.
yup right next to the menil and no power. every block around us has it 🥲 we got power for half a second last night and it disappeared. thinking they’re funneling the power to around us or something
Same thing in the energy corridor. Specifically south dairy ashford. Everything has power except my apartment complex and the neighborhood behind and adjacent to the front. And now it’s raining again😔
"We are in 77006 too, but a little further north. Power all around except for our two blocks."
"No damage, no loss of power in TerraNova. 77379. I know we are lucky here."
Same zip. Still nothing in our area as well. Any idea when we would have power back?
"77449- Still no power on greenhouse road/W little york area as of 430 pm. It came on for a second and then off 2 hours ago so gives us some hope

7:30 pm, power works!!!"
Yeah with how bad the outages are there it'll probably be back on by this time of year in 2028
"If you’re in the same neighborhood as me, I saw a transformer explosion (brilliant blue sky) a little after 3:30am and the power shut back down."
Copy that. 77022 no power as of 6pm~ish last night. Downed power lines due to several mature trees going down.
Man I’ve been hoping y’all would get power so I could go back to work 😭
"General Heights update:
Target Sawyer heights and Kroger studewood are (were) open. Crews are staging out of Target parking lot - saw convoy of ~20 arrive.
Snapped power pole on Studewood at White Oak has been replaced.
Additional crews spotted at 9th & Yale, 10th & Heights, 12th & Heights."
That's the first Ive heard power coming back up in that zip. Encouraging
[deleted]
Can update us when it’s restored around 20th please
"Not 77008, but reports of power being restored to some residences near Monte Beach Park, east of Main."
Any idea if this goes all the way up Jackson Hill?
I live few blocks away and power still off. But thank you. Gives some hopie.
What street or area? Close to westheimer there is still no power
WherI in 77011? I’m in 77011 near navigation and wayside and ours is still out. But I can maybe guess based on you having it again hopefully 
When did it return?
Where are you? I’m near barker and spring cypress and nothing yet… getting worried I am in the zone that got his ‘hard’
I’m in 77077 as well and we still don’t have power :(
"Howdy 🤠 I am current out of town, but reside in Sharpstown. My biggest question to you; are you seeing any major wind damage? I’ve been trying to hail friends and family to swing by and check, but no one has responded to me nor have the time due to the storm."
"That whole strip- whataburger, chick fil a, potbelly, chipotle and salata all have power and are open"
Sometime around 6:15pm
I'm also without power but with water in 77080. Did you notice any gas stations operating in the area?
There’s a Holiday Inn Express on the northbound feeder of the Gulf Freeway at Airport Blvd. that’s open. There’s also a Marriott on the southbound side of the freeway that’s open. There’s also the Doubletree in front of the airport and a regular Holiday Inn catty corner to it on Airport Blvd. and Monroe Dr. There’s also the Hilton Garden Inn next to Enterprise on Monroe.
"I have solar, but I also have a battery, which is crucial in times like these.  If I didn't have my powerwall, I would still be in the dark like everyone else."
Will be interesting to see how much power they got today with all these clouds. Bet it's better than what I got (nothing).
"Re: panels. Yes, we’re off grid all day but have had solar and battery. Gonna run out of battery any minute now, but have been fine sine grid went out yesterday at 7, and will be good when sun comes out tomorrow."
Same zipcode but no power here yet.
"77015, we're still without power too."
77009 - southern part of north side village: we got power back 2 hours ago. You might be due soon.
Where can I find the outage map??
Probably the batteries running the networking equipment behind the scenes ran out.
"I’m in same zip no power as well, LTE/5g working now though"
It’s true.  Live near some.  Never out for more than an hour or so except during the freeze.
it might make your area a priority for restoring power but it won't exactly stop a freak storm from collapsing the power grid
"Utilities have a priority list of substations with critical loads (hospital, fire dept, etc). If they have to do rolling blackouts they will not cut power to those. And when they are doing storm recovery those station are priority to get power back first.

You could always look at inhome energy storage then it won't matter where you live"
"Wouldn’t say protect but hospitals and critical infrastructure grids are the first to get back online because they are the most important. If you live on the same grid as them then you’ll also be part of those services. The thing that most people don’t realize is that the opposite is true as well, so if the critical infrastructure is in a scenario where it doesn’t have enough power but you have available electricity, they will cut you off first and redirect it towards the hospitals."
"That would depend on which routes the electricity goes through. 

Unless you live in an apartment, you're better off just getting a generator or other energy storage solution."
Sounds like me! Thanks for the good news. I ran to my mom’s house to get some of her power lol.
Same
"Fry Rd and Saums 77084 seems to be fine, more or less. Still has power and internet."
I’m driving in from the airport around noon to try and get back to my house in 77084. Any idea if the main roads coming in are clear?
"77084 too, close to Clay and 6. No power. H-E-B on 6 is open but I think the neighborhood Walmart is closed. Haven’t left the house my husband did."
"Just wanted to add Whole Foods on Bellaire/Stella link is fully stocked and has a coffee bar, pizza, and food bar that is good and pretty affordable."
I don’t have power yet. Got an email it was restored and then another one later that they have issues.
What part?
The area of this zip code I am staying has no power in a significant portion.  Service perhaps may be spotty.
Call around Kingwood.  They didn’t lose power.
I found one in Sugarland area.... Good luck
Galleria has some
I would do unspeakable things for a 313 pizza or goode company pie right now.
The part of Hedwig Village we live in hasn’t had power and probably won’t for a while. Power lines are down on the sidewalk at Beinhorn and Piney Point.
"Probably the best bet, unfortunately."
Use the fast food apps. I noticed the Chik Fil A app shows you which ones have power for example.
There are a few places with power on fallbrook and the beltway as of last night. There is a subway in that strip. You could call first before driving over
77026 5th ward no power is there any eta on long were looking at?
We have water in 77018 but no power since last night.
Any word on the bucees Katy?
Any power back?
Where in 77018? We're in Shepherd Park Plaza and really hoping it comes back soon!
the cell service has been terrible. still no power over here & it looks like almost all of spring branch east is still out
Just got power
77055. No power. No cell service. Can’t access centerpoint either….ive heard there is no point anyways. They aren’t giving specific times to any address
"In NE Montrose, didn't lose power. Immediate streets I can see are clear. We were in the Heights when it hit. Lots of damage there and trees down everywhere."
"Think of it this way, it’s backup in case the power coming back is just temporary!"
What part?
"Cooking centers are open around Houston

https://www.ehcma.org/news/672861/

Call 311 tomorrow and see if they have same hours"
"Galena park here still without power since Thursday, saw center point yesterday working on the Main Street but nothing yet"
What part of 77029? I'm in a neighboring zip code and also without power still. 😩
Power has been restored as of about 3:45 PM.
"also 77070 on fm 1960 and Perry no power, it actually went out after the storm died down lol

UPDATE we have power now! 1960 near Willowbrook"
I saw the building yesterday afterwards. So crazy!
Hopefully! I'm off watonga and 43rd and have been without power since 6pm yesterday.
"We are at Spring Cypress and Eldridge area, no power.  Thanks for the heads up about Target."
"Buddy had the same, came over to my att house. I’d suggest you switch"
Is there still no power in the area? I haven't been home since 9 am and was thinking of taking a drive to see if it's back yet
"You have a lobby? 

Damn! All I have is a foyer!"
"Can you tell me more about this HEB, perv?"
"Hopefully you get it back soon! Also in 77004, and we got it back around 10 last night."
My dad lives behind memorial city mall and has power
"Try using a different browser. It doesn’t work with Safari, but works with Chrome"
"77043 still none here, Gessner and Clay"
"77043 Just south of Spring Woods HS, no power, don't come here unless you absolutely have to. Trees and powerlines down on streets and houses (but slowly getting cleaned up)."
It's working. Refresh.
"Outage map doesn’t work using Safari app, but Chrome works."
"Did it flicker on briefly around 8 or so last night?  I’m further south on Voss towards Westheimer

Update: No power or water for us still at 10:30 AM, which is when I headed out. Looks like the Kroger shopping center on Voss and San Felipe has power. I made it to Trotter Y - they have power. They may be letting people that are not members come in to charge? Worth calling to ask."
[deleted]
"77389 gosling and 99 area, never lost power"
Hi neighbor! No damage to houses around but a lot of fallen trees and no power.
"Lots of downed trees/branches in Spring Branch, fences, lawn furniture so it's possible your house got hit but I didn't see any driving around today. The whole area is completely fucked as far as power (no street lights for miles) but destruction-wise doesn't seem too bad."
"Same here… no power, water works but horrible cell service. Took the animals to my parents in Magnolia where they have power"
Hi neighbor! Same here. Debris everywhere. Still no power.
"Same here, there’s a few lines down in the area, I want to say one on lomax and another one down by the berry bridge on e Hardy rd."
I work on Telge(77095) and am like 3 minutes from Cypress Falls too. We have power if that makes you feel any better. They are working on it
also i never lost water!
y’all be safe! 🫶🥹
77084 here. Out of power since last evening 
"I'm in 77084, no power here, cell service is pretty bad since stornadocane and as of Friday 1pm."
I've was able to get ahold of them and they're ok no power and roof damage.
"Yeah, 77012 here, 75th and Harrisburg. Still waiting on power. The Jack In The Box felt like it was taunting us last night, lol. The neighborhood was pitch black but their store was lit up like a beacon of hope."
Kingwood and the area around it barely got hit. Call up there.
My sister in Tomball got hers back around a hour ago
"One area I saw was the transmission line going over 99 along west rd, towards cypress. Multiple towers down and twisted up"
Same zip code. Half of my neighborhood has power and the other half doesn’t. I’m in the half that doesn’t unfortunately.
Still out at TC Jester and Dacoma
"Also 77053 near Spring Woods HS , / Emnora lane no power yet . As of 6:43 am "
WFP is evacuating again because Centerpoint has to turn off all power to do repairs - probably better to hit up a coffee shop
"I work at Allen Center. Our building is fine, but we were told not to come downtown because of all the mess."
Hey neighbor! In memorial towers (Memorial X Deterring). Power has also been out since 6:30. Can you send me a video of that transformer blowing?
Wind knocked the pole over.
No power still in 77006 menil area. Businesses north of Westheimer and south of Richmond seem to have power
Someone else posted they had power but no Internet in 77006
I'd stay home unless you have a reason to be out. A lot of stoplights are out and not everyone is treating them like stop signs. Also a lot of down trees and power lines. Biggest risk is being t-boned at a stoplight.
It's fine
Woot we in kashmir gardens hopeful our section soon but we have lots of lines down around us
not yet on our street
77023 here. Still no power (since Thursday).
Is there major wind damage in your area? We live there also but are out of town.
I'm near Wallisville and 610 and still no power.  My trees are all gone to shit.
"I am currently in Town and Country, do you think this gives us hope for our power to come on soon too?"
Cypress Costco was open for gas. We were there at around 7:20am today
"I'm at the Bunker Hill one in line for gas, line is long."
"77447 as well and no power for us, I really hope it’s back soon. When did your power return?"
"Ugh finally, scrolled forever! Following for this but ours is still out. Whole street it seems."
I never lost power aside from some flickering Thursday night. Pretty amazing considering I've lost power many times during much weaker storms.
So sorry. Good luck
Not my neighborhood.
"Nope, Woodway gardens still out."
Yes it came back on last night around 9:30
"S Heights Blvd and Waugh, no power"
"Not sure unfortunately. 77012 here, our neighborhood started getting some power yesterday. But we're still out. More traffic lights are on in the area, and businesses. Since yesterday."
I am in 77095 and I can see heard more people got there lights back. We are still no power as well.
I’m at Antoine & Pinemont.  Still no power.  Rode my bike earlier near your section and signal lights still out.
Because they're the same dummies who panic buy hours before a hurricane. Terrible planners.
My parents are in your area. Also no power and limited cell service.
Thanks for reporting in. My sister and BIL are in your zip. Hope recovery is easier than expected.
"Can confirm still no power, some of barker cypress had power around 10pm last night and closer to 290 had working gas stations. All signals i went past were working but some areas were pitch black, saw 0 houses with power. The fast food joints between west road and tuckerton on barker cypress were all open last night."
That’s cap. my apartment has no power and I’m on dairy ashford
"Guess I got lucky, ours came back on."
"I’m on the west side of 69 near Sinfull Bakery in 77003, we are still out. It’s like everything east of Fannin, west of 69, north of Elgin, south of I-45 if that makes sense. I’m trying to draw a square/rectangle in your mind"
Power/water is back!
"The Burger Joint posted they have electricity since this am, other than that I don’t know much"
grizzy's hood news is already reporting looting near hwy 59 so his concerns aren't exactly unwarranted. 
Yup. If you catch wind of any gas pumps that have power could you let me know if you remember. Been asking around but can’t really drive in search of one or my car might run out lmao
"I'm assuming you're not in the area: 

Call the Houston non emergency number at 713.884.3131, and the Red Cross might be able to help.

Just be aware they HPD may not get to them for some time."
"Cell service has been trash since the storm, that might be the reason. Hope you hear from them soon. 🙏🏽"
All the surrounding zip codes have gotten power but we’re right in the middle but here’s hoping
What’s your cross street? Near main and Michaux (Norhill). We’re staying at a friends tonight and trying to figure out from afar.
Update: still no power in my apartment complex but everything around us has power 😔
77007 Sabine st between Allen and Washington just got power and water back
East montrose 77009?
I’m 77043 on upland and we have power and water is good. Hopefully that changes for you too.
What street? Checking for my out of town friend that lives near navigation and Cesar Chavez
Yeah I'm in that area and we still don't have any power. Any estimates
I'm near hobby now and everything is on around here
I’m near hobby without power
Spec's downtown is open.
"HEB was closed so I assume not, but I heard the power varied block to block"
"My mom lives there, still no power"
any power yet?
"77007, still no power also"
"Same everyone around this area never lost power except like 1,000 it’s irritating"
[Houston Transtar](https://www.houstontranstar.org/) or Google Maps
"Coming from where?Lots of areas in Houston have power, generally south. I went into Montrose yesterday for a hot meal & supplies at Tar-jay."
I don’t know what these idiots are doing but my power keeps turning on and then back off
"009 over in Lindale Park, no power since 6:30. Lots of downed branches but nowhere near the damage I’ve seen elsewhere."
In the 77009 zip code and we have power. On E 28th between airline and N Main
Any update on power in the 09 area? We went to my sisters in Katy since that have power.
Also shady acres and north of 22nd and I don’t have power!
Shady Acres 18th and Beall - haven’t had power since the storm hit.
Yeah I’m 21st and Couch and no power.
"I’m at 26th and Couch and still no power. 

My neighbor went out this morning and said at 25th and Couch a tree is down and took some power lines with it."
That intersection was completely blacked out when I drove by at 6 AM
"It's open, was there at 7am, got ice.  No perishables for sale.  Credit/debit only, no power, limited staff."
"Not only is Kroger open for non-perishables (card only), I am actually getting decent 5G reception in their parking lot."
I drove by that Kroger a couple hours ago. It looked like the store might be open as there were plenty of cars and looked like a line of people at the doors. The gas station did not look open at all. I didn't see any gas stations open along Shepherd from I-10 to 19th. Places look more open down near Washington and Memorial.
My husband had to drive all the way into downtown to find a gas station that was open last night. Hopefully there's some closer options that have power today.
Area near el gato coffeehouse looked like it had power when I was on my way to work this morning
"Gas station on Main near 45 (near Cantina Barba, which is also open) had power and gas as of 1 hr ago when I drove by. I think the gas station at Main and Airline may even have power."
Try turning off the A/C.
so frustrating
"Of course they do. They arent about to share it right now because people would lose their shit. They are going to pad the news by eating up the next few days before they soft trickle the ETA to the public. Imagine how the overall demeanor of everyone would change if they just went on and dropped that ""3  weeks"" ETA out there at a news briefing. They know the power that message holds (no pun intended). Everybody is hopeful right now. They use that to their advantage cause that ""3 weeks eta"" is going to bring out some folks true colors."
[deleted]
I’m in 77009 didn’t see a lot of damage on cavalcade/airline but didn’t go into the neighborhoods as I had to rush to work
Ugh sorry man. Hopefully Centerpoint gets to you quickly
Yea. Seems like it’s partial. I’m in 77079 and had power the whole time except for a small flicker.
"I’m in 77079 and our neighborhood is still without power, for blocks in any direction"
"77040 by Tidwell and 290, still no power."
We got power back at 8 pm 77040
[deleted]
095 here but we got lucky. We have power and no damage. Minimal debris too.
"Hey neighbor. If you need fuel, the detached Kroger gas station at beltway and west road has power and fuel."
"Thank you :] luckily, i filled up morning before storm rolled through"
I'm near Ella and Tidwell. I drove up Ella from 610 at 8pm last night coming home from work and it looks like a hurricane ripped thru. Tons of debris. Many trees down. Several streets blocked. I feel like I haven't seen damages like this since Ike in '08. Anyways no power still for us either
Ella and Pinemont. Same.
Is the circle k on oak forest/43rd open? They were open during the freeze
"Forgive my ignorance, but why do we do this?"
"Thank you, neighbor!  Jones Road area appreciates your report!"
Yeah it woke me up and I’ve had little sleep since but it did pop on for just a second. I’m pretty sure there are centerpoint trucks in my neighborhood assessing damages and seeing what can be fixed quickly
Fingers crossed. That's not far from me.
"In my neighborhood most houses seem fine. Lots of smaller branches fell but it doesn’t appear that massive damage was done anywhere. Down Cypress North Houston, Ravens Way has many fences knocked down. I didn’t go into the neighborhood to look for more damage but it seemed like it was limited to primarily fence damage thankfully. We do have 2 or 3 very big trees that were knocked down but they fell onto the roads and have already been moved out of the way."
Damn. I’m in 77449 and nothing still.
Im at west and greenhouse. Just got a message from our mud about running on a generator. No water will be the icing on the cake. 😩
You live at fairfield ranch and have power?
There’s power there? Are the gas stations working?
Im just thankful it’s somewhat cool and not sunny.
My parents are in 77057 so I'm hoping you get it soon!
"77057 we never lost power, but the block next to mine and going down towards Galleria mall it was dead. Those areas have power back now so hopefully you will get it soon."
"Also dark in 77057. Power has been off since before the storm. Had a flicker when it passed, but then out again."
Ugh same. 77057 nothing
We have power if you just want to come hang out in the AC.
"I've had consistent power since about 6am, however right now I know cell service is spotty and most phone calls are not going through. Try texting, my service went out for a while last night but I could get texts"
"Same with my parents, they are okay my brother is going to drive my mom out of town to get her out of the house. My dad is still there hanging out with the cats. Cell service is spotty and most phone calls are not going through. Try texting, my service went out for a while last night but I could get texts just not calls. The roads are not so bad. However if they live in a highrise like the St. James condo they might not have power, that side of 056 is without, my brother lives off sage he hasn't had it, transformers keep blowing"
"TC Jester & Tidwell has 3 gas stations open, I just filled up."
"Unfortunately yes. I drove the 290 feeder from Fairbanks to Antoine and back an hour ago, and power is out all along there on both sides. Lots of downed trees and bent power lines too"
[deleted]
"Guessing you must be in the McAddams since it looks like all the lights are still on there? Can you spare a cup of electricity, neighbor?"
"I knew it'd be bad but weeks, plural? Fuck. That 90+ degree weather coming is gonna be real fun"
"Yes, but the pressure it’s lower than usual"

"Southwest side seemed to have mostly done good. Driving home last night traffic lights were all up, power was on, only little sticks and leaves blown all over the road. At anybody needing groceries or fuel, maybe y'all will have better luck looking in that direction."
"Same here, we made it through the storm just fine. But lost power some time after midnight. I’m starting to get concerned about my fridge contents if it doesn’t come back soon 😕

W Belfort & Chimney Rock area"
I was driving around today and didn’t see a centerpoint truck either. Sigh.
"that sucks, oh well hopefully it’s soon enough thanks for the update"
did your buddy give you an estimated time for energy restoration in the heights area? specifically around heb area?
"Far NW, like 99 area."
I also blame the vague general status info we get on a key utility.
This deserves more upvotes!
"Same- I’m 4th gen Houstonian, been thru cat 4/5 hurricanes (and an earthquake in LA) this was worse. I’m still so confused about what happened and how it was so bad. Our neighborhood recoded 122 mph wind gusts. It looks like a war zone. Still no power and no cell service."
"I don't know how it was 20 years ago, but I was there last summer and felt safe wherever I went."
AT$T mobile has service issues even on the best of days
thanks for this context
"I have AT&T this morning my Mom and Dad were both able to call me (from the midwest) without issue, but I couldn't call my gf's phone that was in the same room as me (call would instantly drop)"
We’re technically magnolia park but just south of Harrisburg. Nothing yet on our side :/
Dang I need some of this power you speak of.
"We have power again in our block, but see neighbors still without 😰"
My mom is 77011. She's north of Harrisburg south of Navigation and no power. She says that almost everyone around her area does have power. 
"Any word on power at the apartments in that area, left for work at 6am, wondering what I'm going to comeback too."
"Im by Jackson Hill as well, running water but no power."
Sorry to hear this. We’ve got water and power on Jackson hill.
Same but I have lower water pressure than normal. Is that the same with you?
No power down the block near Washington and S Heights. Managed to get a warm shower using whatever water was left in the hot water heater before the power kicked off.
"I'm west of TC, south of I10. Lost power when you did. Any damage in your area?"
Rice military near memorial. No power but water is running. We could get a cell signal on Tmobile network so I'm at work.
I went yesterday Sabine st still had no power or water
"I'm surprised by that since we live right next to the new power towers they installed last year.

I'm not worried about power as we have solar and a Tesla powerwall.  We have an extension cord over the fence so they can charge up their phones.

Edit: 

Looks like the front half of my neighborhood has power. 

Mostly branches on the ground as opposed to entire trees."
"No, the one on Harrisburg near 76th."
"I winded around and used 12th to Shepherd to get to work.  Work has A/C and power to charge my battery bank.  TC Jester is all messed up with trees.  It looks bad, but I had to get to work to do some things before headed back home to clean out the fridge.  Hope you made it through okay.  It's def a mess in my general area."
I’m in the same zip code never lost power.
"Yep, decided to check it out. Looks like 8-9 trucks around that station right now"
7:40pm
They’ll take any opportunity to shove politics down our throats and say “told you so” like our opinions have any direct effect on weather events
Heard Longpoint and Bingle area got their power back a little while ago. Hopefully getting closer. Good luck to you.
"So close, but so far."
Ugh we are at Campbell and Long point and still no power 😭
Behind the HEB @ Bunker Hill
"I live in Campbell and blalock, no power. 

It came on for a minute earlier today but it shut off and it did that a few times."
Is that still the case? We were told it would be on by 10pm
"Yeah, I live on Park Row, Addicks reservoir is right behind my apartment. I haven’t gone to look at how full it is yet, but I’m sure it’s a lot."
me too! Fingers crossed for all of us!
"USDA recommends throwing away most food in the fridge after 4 hours. A full freezer can be kept up to 48 hours. 
[source here](https://www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/food-safety-during-power-outage#:~:text=As%20the%20USDA%20notes%20in,after%204%20hours%20without%20power.)"
Wtf
What product does your company sell? My family owns a chain of liquor stores so I'm curious
"Thank you, glad you're doing okay!"
"Sorry- just meant that it sucked we happened to be a weird minority of our area that was affected. The neighborhood next to and across from us wasn’t affected at all, and neither was virtually anyone in the Clear Lake area where we work. This could mean our situation isn't too bad/will be fixed sooner, or the complete opposite😭"
"They have generators, no?"
I’m at Richmond and Mandell. Haven’t lost power (yet).
"Was just biking around. Seems like north of Westheimer, y'all have power. 

The majority of the square surrounded by Westheimer, Richmond, Shephard, and Montrose has no power"
Same here man
"77084 reporting in again...

Still no power, have seen some major downed lines near us bc I finally ventured out, so I'm really feeling it'll be awhile. Same for whatever in 77095 that doesn't have power yet.

I have no official word, though. 🙁"
"Hopefully you get your power sooner, my neighborhood has really bad damage on the power lines so CP is going to have to chop the massive branches and re run the lines."
Also 77066 here. Haven't had power since the storm started last night.
GOTT IMMM
I’m right by you- we left to charge our phones and get gas. We also have no cell service at our house- we are at Wirt and Westview. Anyone else not have cell service?
"Got an email from centerpoint saying power was restored, but nothings come back on as far as I can tell. Fingers crossed theyre working on it right now"
no clue. I tried submitting a claim online but it never went through so I called the number instead
We had the flicker as well. I don’t have any real understanding of how it works but have been told we are on a different grid. 
"i'm close to the menil too. heb has power, but my apartments do not. i'm close to richmond and dunlavy."
That’s awesome! Maybe there’s hope that we’ll be back on soon.
Ours was just restored about 45 minutes ago. Hopefully you are soon!
Nothing at Fry and W Little York yet either
Yes! The power came back that night at 3:30 for a full minute or so then back out. I wonder how long a blown transformer takes. Especially in the scope of everything else going on.
It’s bad man
Do you know the cross streets the downed lines are on?
"As of this evening, 20th street was extremely hit and miss. 20th and Shepherd is restored, 20th and main has reports has reports of power as of tonight, but a lot in between is still down. 

The power crews ~appear to have been working south to north from I-10 upward. At least, that’s the sequence that power was coming back online. (Shepherd and 11th first, then shepherd and and 14th, etc…)"
Looks like no. I have nothing near Patterson and Feagan
[This is all I've seen in regards to Jackson Hill](https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1cu1spu/megathread_storm_damage_outage_and_resource/l4g5l0k/)
Same!
Winrock/San Felipe aeea
3:41
"I was about to head to the store and see, so far there has been a report of a downed power line on Bellaire by the freeway. Will report back!

Edit: the area around Beechnut and Fondren looks alright all things considered!"
"I'm wondering the same about 77076, we have family there and no one is answering the phone this am."
"There are some trees down, lots of small branches. Neighbor's house had a tree on its roof."
There are some on Brittmore that are up and running.
Hammerly and Hwy6 is open for gas
"I can tell you exactly. 

As of 6:32, my panels produced 6.4 kwh, compared to 39.8 kwh, which is the highest produced this year this past Wednesday."
77092 still down
Hi. Around which street is this? I live near Burnett St and am wondering if the power's back on. (Currently at an inn while keeping my fingers crossed).
Unfortunately still no power this morning
"https://gis.centerpointenergy.com/outagetracker/

It’s not really working though.  I’ve had it work three times in the last few days."
*update- Power was up for a few hours but shut down
[deleted]
Should be. My neighbor landed last night around 10:30 and was able to get home. Spring Branch area
I got the exact same emails. The outage tracker says our area should be powered on but nothing
Some did. I’m pretty smack in the middle of it right now without power.  A few elementary schools were closed today because of it.
Yes. Luckily there are lot of coffee shops and fast food places open.
Thank you. I am headed to Chick  Fil A now
[deleted]
Damn our apartment told us we won’t get water till we get power. And we don’t know when we’ll get power
Update. Apartment is saying we have power but water is on another grid so no water yet
"It is open, and they had water as well at around 7 pm today"
Nope 👎
"Damn, okay. I live in the area and have been charging my stuff at work"
[deleted]
"We’re 77070, 249 and Cypresswood. Thankfully we kept power. One tree down on top of a car in our neighborhood and not a lot else it seems. We were in The Heights when it rolled through though and it was crazy. Took nearly two hours to get home as well."
That's a bummer :/ almost made it.
"At my house, no.  But other blocks do. "
"We are a gun range. 

Top Gun Range"
"In regards to what? 

Traffic?  Stock? 

The dairy and lunch meats were practically gone, but we're being restocked."
"Yeah, driving around this morning I saw houses with power closer to HCC but a power line still down at McGowen and Caroline, thinking that’s probably the hold up"
🥺
Hope it comes back soon for you!
Thank you for the update!
Thank you they must have no charge on their phones
"Love the name of the storm, thank you for the update"
"Hi neighbor! 

Tell me about it. 

I thought about breakfast there, but fuck that line."
Is power unable to be restored without those transmission towers being fixed? I'd imagine it's going to take weeks at best to replace those...
We just got ours back! You may be due soon.
"Actually, not sure about the pole, but definitely the big palm tree in front! Cracked in half"
Apparently 77023 potentially can be restored tonight?
There are a lot of trees and stuff all over everyones yards. We dont have power. Idk when its coming back. I expect itll be days. I saw in the Villages there were some pine trees that damaged homes but i didn’t see anything around my neighborhood. I live by Rummel Creek
"Lot of trees down in this area.  

Maxie road between Woodforest and Wallisville have multiple poles falling down due to trees uprooted. 

Centerpoint is working in this area to get the poles back up for the last couple of hours. 

More rain is making things tough for the linemen."
"KHOU dropped a map on Instagram to show potential timelines. It could be up to the 22nd for spots in Houston. Lots of food an AC and wifi in most of CityCentre,  I saw folks eating and working at the restaurants with laptops.

If you need help, holler!"
"Around midnight to 1 AM, in Ranch Country subdivision"
[deleted]
Same.  Hoping they continue working in the area.  Haven't seen any updates on the tracker but hoping its a delay issue on their side to update their website
Thx.  Hoping it continues throughout the zip code
"Thanks for the update! I appreciate it. 
I hope it comes back for us soon."
My brother works at Costco and told me yesterday after the worst of the storm passed the panic buying started and someone came in and bought loads of toilet paper. Some people are nuts.
"It’s very spotty, apparently. But a lot of stuff on Westheimer is open. Same with CityCentre."
Thanks!!!!
"Oh I don't doubt there will be heavier crime tonight but my parents don't have any precious metals in their house. Looters gonna be pissed they wasted their time on pewter vases and ""collectible"" Queen Elizabeth and John Wayne plates."
I got you. I’m getting off work shortly (Montgomery County). I’ll check and update. A co worker of mine just arrived and mentioned she didn’t see anything with power until she hit Fry/99
The Bridgeland Facebook group says that 99 and Clay Shell has power.
7-11 at Barker Cypress and West has power. Filled a 5 gallon tank for the generator last night at 9pm.
Near cavalcade by the farmers market kinda!
What area
Yes power has been restored!! Thank you.
Yes.  What's the difference in the order in which I wrote it?  It's the same thing.
How’s it in the neighborhood west of upland? Have family there I haven’t been able to get ahold of.
None. I haven’t even seen centerpoint.
Thanks!
"HEB at Bunker Hill was open today as of around 3:00 - they weren’t too crowded which surprised me. Shelves were getting kind of bare in some spots.
Not sure about Costco ."
Figured as much. Thank you
"according to the people I have there, none yet"
Guess we are the “20%” remaining..
I’m coming downtown!
I’m at 77007. Studemont at Allen Pkwy.
"I saw at least 2 downed power lines due to falling trees in Lindale Park. One on English and one on Canadian. We have a lot of old growth trees, so I knew it wasn't going to be pretty."
Jealous
Still no power. No estimates yet either.
also shady acres @ 23rd and beall- no power yet
"It’s off haha. Generator isn’t big enough to run the AC. I have a small portable ac unit but I haven’t turned it on because it’s been fairly cool. I’m only running a couple fans, the WiFi gateway, and the fridge."
Between 17th and 16th a block off of Shepard. Can’t upload photo here but it was down across a bunch of lines and the pole was pulled to the ground.
"I’m staying at my friend’s place near that intersection and have been driving around a lot today, far less damage in the northeast corner of the Heights and just looked like limbs and fences. I didn’t see anything in any roofs over here."
Power back on around 11!
No ETA from Centerpoint either
I'm in 77040 but my power didn't come back till about 4am
No power still in 77040 near the highschool 
"You are lucky! We are still without power! I’m not complaining, I’m just glad nothing happened to us!"
The Exxon on Ella and Tidwell is open
"Sorry...I'm not sure 😕
I went the opposite direction"
"If the power keeps flickering on and off so does your A/C. Is it bad for it, I'd say there is a distinct possibility since it's not going through the cycles. Since it's not running without power anyway just for safety sake turn it off. 

It's also one of the biggest ""users"" of electricity, especially at start up. When the power is returned 100's of thousands of a/c start at the same time, that's a large pull on the system. 

Once stable power is returned fire it back up."
"To elaborate on Johnny’s comment: it’s very hard on the compressor and some of the electrical components (capacitors) to suddenly start and stop. 

If a capacitor blows it’s a pretty cheap repair- but nothing works until that happens. If your compressor goes it’s anywhere from really-not-cheap to way expensive."
"Yep, my mom is in 77070 just down the road off Jones and said the same thing. It flickered around 3am. That’s got to be hopeful, right?"
As if 2:15 still out.
"Just bought a house in Ravensway, hope it didn’t get damaged.  Haven’t even closed on it yet."
Update 3: 1960 down North Eldridge till 290 lights have been turned back on. Various businesses around these lights are still out of power it seems but good news power is returning to Cypress!
HEB on Tuckerton so cypress creek lakes
I parked in the Target parking lot and they had power. I’m not sure about gas stations.
This is the silver lining I’m appreciating right now.
Tomorrow looks like it's gonna hit 92 degrees though
Yeah some parts of 77057 have power even when the property next door doesn't have power so it gives me hope that it's not a transmission line issue and maybe just some broken branches.
"Appreciate the offer my man, I'm lucky enough to have a solid friend group that is taking care of me at the moment."
Great news. Thanks for the info.
Much appreciated
"Yeah I work in that area, even in a lighter storm the lights go out in that area."
"77024 near the Spring Branch Library. No power since last night but have had water all along, as of 7:30 pm (Friday)."
"77024 some areas now have power, however no data if T-Mobile"
Any idea when the power or water pressure will be back? I’m nearby in garden oaks
🤘🏿
"Just came back from HEB in Meyerland. It’s really just an ordinary weekday so please if anyone needs fuel or groceries, there’s plenty here."
We’re similar but just east of 75th and got I back half and hour ago. They’re definitely working the area
"Same, but a bit lower in the pecan park (77012) neighborhood. Still have power, but plenty of trees down and a hole in our roof. Lame but thankful to be okay. Hope y’all stay safe."
There is a big tree down on a line across Lockwood. Going to be a while.
[deleted]
[deleted]
"Seems normal, was able to take a shower this morning."
"Nothing serious. Some downed trees, power lines, and the occasional fence."
"Hey neighbor! Power here (pecan park, 77012) but a hole on the roof. Stay safe."
Oh Nvm that's deeper down east
"Just walked my dog, and TC Jester is completely blocked by multiple trees near us. Definitely some scary scenes around here."
Apparently a generator blew and only a couple buildings in my complex lost power. Of course I’m one of them :(
Same thing happened with the floods in Dubai. Victims in areas with conservative leadership don’t deserve sympathy apparently.
Yeah…im basically at bingle and westview
"My in-laws live a couple of streets behind Costco there, their neighbors across the street have power, they don’t!"
Still no power at 10:30pm
I’m curious what if I bought a bag of ice and stored it in the fridge.. I wonder if that would keep things going a little longer.
Mayor's office I think said power should be on for people within 48 hours. I don't know how good that word is but I hope it's enough. Hopefully power comes on before anyone has throw to empty thier fridge/ freezer
A closed refrigerator works similar to a cooler.  Maybe YETI and RTIC should start making fridges that keep food cold for 7 days though…
We make mixers! And hot sauce
They do have generators. Went past last night and everything else was without power except H‑E‑B. Everyone in this thread is concerned about how many groceries they’re going to lose in their fridge but if H‑E‑B didn’t have generators it would be infinitely worse.
Probably! But it looks like the apartment across the street and traffic lights on Dunlavy and W Alabama  also have power.
I'm one block away from you! No power still
My friends by Menil still have no power
Still no power as of 7:30 this morning.
"We actually found an open Whataburger but came back because we have loud dogs and didn't wanna leave them in the no AC complex too long. Other places open is the Bucees in Cypress, Walmart and HEB in the Heights (I don't recommend going closer to downtown tho). Hotels might have an open door, at least the lobby areas could be open to charge phones maybe."
Can you please reply here when it does? I just want to have an idea and a bit of hope that it's gonna be restored soon. 
Have you gotten your power back? I'm in 77080 and don't have mine!
Wow that’s great!! Hopefully we will be next. I’m north of 290 and rosehill rd
We are going to try and hold out overnight. Pregnant wife and mom insists on staying but heck no with 90 degree weather coming. Might stay at relatives in Beaumont and try to savage anything from the freezer with coolers
"Pretty sure it makes us a low priority, unfortunately."
Thank you!
Good to hear that im closer to westheimer and nothing yet
Im in 77076. No power and internet for anybody
Power should be on.
Power on!
"If you click on the notepad icon on the right of the map it brings up the outages by zip code, this is the part that is updating every five minutes."
Same here. Feels bad man.
"there are downed power lines laying on hwy6 north, that's why police are blocking it off."
"I'm glad! We're fortunate enough to have a few over here open as well. If my power doesn't come back once it starts getting warmer, I'm just gonna hunker down at one of those places. ☺️"
Where in fithward? I’m by Collingsworth and Hirsch rd…. Still no power as of noon Saturday.
"Not just a gun range

*Top* Gun Range"
"Are yall the ones with the listing for a female front desk person? I saw a posting driving the other day, but can't pinpoint where I saw it."
The braless situation. Is it down bad?
"That’s about where I am. My neighbors in the same townhouse cluster didn’t have power come back on last night, but it may have come back on at some point this morning. It was crazy outside last night!"
power was out when i left the area this morning. i couldn't receive phone calls last night and imessage wasn't going through for some people. seems data/voice was down for a while. hopefully everyone is okay.
"Haaay! Yeah we got lucky, we pulled in when it was 4-5 cars deep and it moved pretty fast. By the time we were close to the window it was 2 times as long. At least there are a few options in the area!

Assuming power isn't coming back anytime soon I'm probably gonna take my ass to a coffee joint to chill, lol."
Did you see an update? I can't find anything on centerpoint outage tracker.
No!!!! :( what about you guys!?
The tracker has been useless for me. I put in my address & nothing happens. It would be nice to get an ETA!
Appreciate you
Good deal I’ll head that way after work unless we get power where I’m at first. Thank you!
What FB group are you in?
Next to Washington Ave. sandman and Durham cross streets
Bc 09 isn’t montrose…
I haven’t left yet but will soon. Will let you know
Do you see all the trucks? They were all around that area by HEB
My pecan tree in my back yard bit the bullet. Fell east thankfully and spared our house to the north and our neighbors to the west and south. About as fortunate as we could've gotten with that tree. Our neighbor across helmers had a huge segment of his tree land across the road.
"Yea, fridge is pretty critical.  I had to scrounge ice and filled up a cooler."
nice. still nada for me in 77079
Cheers!
Which part of 77040? The northwest side of the beltway? Over by 290 on the other side we're still without :(
"Same, no power for us in Audubon neighborhood."
I’ve got crossed fingers
"I’ve been to Ravensway a lot and I do know that although some areas flood pretty bad, I rarely hear or see many reports of house damage in that neighborhood."
Oh ok. Thanks.
"77024, there's a business complex right next to my apartment complex with power, please tell me a couple weeks is an exaggeration.. :("
Nope have no idea
My mom says Canal has power but she doesn't have anything. She's hopeful that it comes back soon and me too so I can go over there 
You just be in the Avenues. I am too. Hoping it’s coming back soon. Looked like it was on at canal. 
"We never lost running water, but power was finally restored at 4 am."
Sorry to hear that
"That's that classic liberal compassion for you. Anyone in such a place is obviously complicit

Collective punishment is their fetish"
They would make a killing selling appliances like that in areas prone to bad weather.
"Sure, if you want to pay 10,000 dollars for it."
Edited. Meant the say Richmond and Mandell.
"Fleet of CP trucks by the Taco Bell at Uvalde, we maybe getting closer"
"Still nothing, outage tracker says we should have power but no luck. Lots of places around us are starting to get power again though"
Finally back on!
I’m also pregnant and have nothing but empathy for your wife. I may end up at my in laws.
Just came back!
Hang in there! That's a pretty high traffic area so it's gotta be on their short list to fix.
Awesome!!  Thank you!
So it's not Dom?
Not us my friend
"If you mean by crowded, then it calmed down quite a bit while I was there. 

If you're referring to the ""braless"" aspect, then that's a normal thing there for some reason."
Thank you for the update
"Fortunately, we can cook with gas, but sometimes you crave something else. 

Our powerwall is only charging a tad because of the cloud cover, so we're trying to conserve a bit to at last until the morning."
"Called CP the other day and since 77023 isn’t color coded they said assume it is the color closest to you, which looking at the updated map it’s today"
Alright. So I found an Exxon on cypress rose hill that’s stocked full of ice and a lot of people fueling up and grabbing tacos. it’s halfway between 290 and 99 🤙🤙everything south of 290 is dead
Bridgeland News.
Sorry Nett & Durham street
"BA-HA-HA-HAHAHA!!  77009 is my mother's zip code.  77006 is mine.  I'm ""[not the sharpest bulb in the room](https://www.threads.net/@bidenharrishq/post/C69c_L0C4u6/?xmt=AQGzkv5JHyQik1Jvv349E5dakYP-gunDMdBw7YCIjxegzg)""."
🙏🏽
I haven’t been out there but I’m guessing that they are close to getting this fixed.  My power was on for about 5 min then off and on again for like a minute and now back off.
Fuuuuck
"I'm near the corner of BW8 and 290, near the post office"
"Thanks for the extra info.  I’m immigrating, and haven’t arrived yet.  Don’t know the areas well but tried to avoid certain areas with natural disasters when purchasing.  Trying to find out if anything was damaged before closing."
No problem. I hope you stay safe neighbor

"lol keep whining about the power outages but this is what you get for electing Greg Abbot! Cruz is on his flight to Cancun right now! Can’t say I feel sorry about Texas. (Houston is in Texas, right?)"
Some doomsday prepper will lol Texas has a market for these kind of things I feel like. 😂
Wishing you and your baby the best!!
Thank you so much!!
"Ah, damn. Well, if yall are looking! 😁"
"Just left that HEB, can confirm that it's not busy and everything is well stocked. Anyone that plans on going, be advised that the traffic lights in the area are down so watch out for idiots skipping their turn

Edit: the Kroger off 10 at Studemont has a gas station with power. Lines weren't bad, not much of a wait"
"Yeah, that's a good call!"
Just drove through. Doesn’t look great but not horrible. Pretty sure they don’t have power and their phones lost battery
indeed
"This was a freak tornado filled windstorm and although we do prepare very well for the annual threat of hurricanes, tornados (at least in my experience living here for 20 years) haven’t been seen in a LONG time. It’s something that you really can’t prepare for other than premade shelters which we don’t have since tornados basically never happen here."
Damn that sucks. We haven’t started tossing anything yet. Still cold in the freezer as of an hour ago when I opened it to get a popsicle. Hoping for the best.   
Yep heard that same transformer blow at 6:30pm yesterday off of Floyd. No power but we still have water as far as I can tell.
"We are hiring though, DM me and I’ll give you my email for you to send your resume"
"Yeah. 

Our neighbors were laughing at us when we installed it but stopped doing so after the freeze and after every outage."
Thanks for checking. Appreciate you!
"Yes, HorrorBitch37 sounds like she would make an excellent addition to your team!"
"Yeah, you'd be a fool to laugh at anything that can provide power. Especially after the last few years we've had."
Tbf that sounds better than crazy cat mom
"UDATE5 2230 on 7/12:

- The 345kV autoxfmr in the immediate area along with a corresponding crosstown 138kV line (through the Heights to Liberty/Wayside/Crosby) are still on outage. A tentative return of 7/13 1700 remains unchanged for the xfmr, the line segment estimates have not been updated, still showing 7/10 2200. Speculation: the damage on these two particular segments appears to be heavy because the other segments returned on 7/10 as expected. There is likely some major snag like heavy equipment, fallen high-kV towers, or loss of critical equipment at the stations. Power can get to the Heights without this line but my guess is that it is the impact right now.

- Belfort and Kirby, nearby major load breaker is on outage, started today at 0900 and runs until 7/15 1700.

- Work is slated from Pearland through Friendswood, League City, towards the coast by Dickinson. This complex of lines will be out tomorrow from 0700 to 1700. Impacts will likely be minimal, they are trying to avoid disrupting more customers.

- Work in Galveston is largely complete on high kV lines.

I ask you kindly, *please* **do not blame or attack the linemen/line workers**.  They are trying their best, lack of prep and vegetation management, system hardening, etc are not *their fault*.  Please treat them with respect, they are working very hard to get things back.

---------------------

UPDATE4:  0915 on 7/11:

- Not a ton of changes overnight, mainly times updated for work going on today.  Work end around noontime in areas:  Greenspoint, Lake Houston/BW8, central Pasadena, 59/Fannin (ends 1700), and Addicks.  These are all breaker outages generally related to re-energization of the high kV (read: big) lines.  

- All of the major 345kV lines have been back while one major 138kV line crossing town from 290/610 through the Heights to Beaumont remains out in two sections.  This work was scheduled to come back last night at 2200 and did not, no new estimate.

- One major 345kV xfmr is out of service near 290/610 along the aforementioned string coming out of the Heights.  This is not expected to return until 1700 on 7/13 (end of Saturday).  This may be one of the reasons CNP is giving guidance for restorations continuing into Sunday.

- While I know this all sucks so bad, the line crews did an pretty good job of restoring the high kV lines ahead of schedules in most cases.  The problem is increasingly going to the last few miles of low kV distribution lines that feed your street.  That means each line fixed is increasingly less 'bang for the buck' in terms of customers restored, simply because they've hit most of the big ones.

-------------------

UPDATE3:  2140 on 7/10:

- lines from Addicks to WP/BW8 to Bellaire returned to service

- major breaker in south Pasadena returned to service

- the crosstown work may have hit snags with the middle section that traverses the Heights still scheduled for outage ending 7/10 2200 so that work is likely to be moved to tomorrow.  This includes a major xfmr at 610/290 that is scheduled to come back 7/13 1700

Points to remember:

- major lines feed the smaller lines.  This is all information about major lines, not the lines that go to your house or even feed your neighborhood.  These are big big lines that are the backbone of the system.

- lines going out of service is normal, particularly when things need to be de-energized to fix them.  Most of the time de-energizations happen and you never even know it because other lines handle the change but right now it's very possible to gain power and then lose it again.  I know that it incredibly frustrating, but it's really the only way.

- most work is likely moving to the distribution network where visibility drops.  Currently it looks like they plan to wrap up major work by end of Saturday although that may easily move.

- likely outages will be updated and new plans come out overnight from the work this evening.

--------------------

UPDATE2: 1635 on 7/10:

- lines from Addicks to WP/BW8 to Bellaire are out of service as expected, given a return time of 1900 tonight.  We'll see.  If you lost power this afternoon along those areas, that's probably why.

- work on a major crosstown 138kV line through the Heights to Crosby is going out this evening (1630) and expected back at 2200.  This is likely to go out or may already be out, hopefully come back later tonight.

- some major work on the east side near the ship channel finished.

- work near 290/BW8 Cyprus area finished early (was slated for 7/12)

------------------
EDIT, UPDATE as of 1225 on 7/10:

- a new string of outages is planned in West Houston for **this afternoon**.  If you live in the regions of Westpark/59, Westpark/BW8, Eldridge from West Park north to Addicks, this whole string of lines may be out this afternoon.  Be aware you may lose power in these areas, hard to say.  This is associated with with updated Addicks breaker outage today.  If you are around these areas and do not have power, it is possible it will come back for some this evening if these outages finish.  

- 59 / Fannin / Main has an outage most of the day tomorrow

- an important outage in Bellaire is scheduled to come back at 1300 today but appears to be behind schedule.

- work is active across Galveston with many of the high kV lines to and on the island on intraday outage.

FYI the utility crews work super-hard during events like this, particularly the mutual assistance crews from out-of-state.  Don't yell at these poor guys, it's not their particular fault, they just fix things.  Please treat them like the semi-heros they are.

------------------------

What I can tell you from high-level ERCOT data as of 0920 on 7/10:

- most of the major 345kV lines (biggest size used in ERCOT) across the city have been restored, some ahead of schedule.  This includes lines into Bellaire and from Westpark/BW8 to 290/610.  Lines north from Humble to Tomball have come back as have major lines in Baytown.  Many of the 138kV (second-biggest size) have returned as well.

- some major 138kV lines extending to Galveston remain out past their initial expected return date, new estimates not yet provided.

- there are a lot of breaker outages that are schedule to be completed today.  These actions can often involve people with power losing it for a period to de-energize / re-energize a section of line.  I know this is the most frustrating thing in the world to lose power again but it is part of the process to restore the grid and must be done.

- those same breaker outages are now getting scheduled into tomorrow as well.  Often this implies a schedule of work that is increasingly being known.  Knowing what to do is the first step and largely that process seems to be complete.

- some breaker and xfmr outages have been extended, most stubbed dates are currently 7/12 or 7/13.  Consider those placeholders, they have been changing a lot with several lines scheduled for 7/12 returns back already.

- this is all at the high kV line level.  I cannot tell you anything about zip codes or neighborhoods or individual distribution lines.  However fixing the big branches is the next step, then smaller lines.

I just want to say that I have gotten far more communication from CenterPoint re: trying to sell me gas line insurance than I have about the outage in my neighborhood.
"The lack of communication is I think the thing we’ve strapped with the most. No map to see what’s going on with power. No estimated times for restoration, etc. 

No idea how bad it was at my place because haven’t been able to watch any news today, etc"
[deleted]
Centerpoint restoration seems to have stalled over last hour.
"FUCKING HELL. If CenterPoint would just tell us approximately when to expect power back, we could make informed decisions like whether to leave or not. I don’t want to load two little kids and a screaming cat in the car, drive for four hours to get to the closest hotel, then drop an extra couple hundred bucks on a room just to find out that our power was restored two hours after we left."
[deleted]
"Use the WhataBurger app, shows which establishments are out/on and is better than the CenterPoint tracker in a lot of instances"
77058 just came on. Clear Lake
still nothing off 1960 near willowbrook in NW cypress 77070 :/
Any tips for what to do with animals in the event power isn’t restored? I can power through but worried about my cats.  Besides plenty of water for them to drink
"77009 

I can’t do another 6 days without power, I genuinely might have to hit up my ex and tell her I’m sorry if it comes down to that long without power.

It’s so infuriating seeing power around me be restored. At least I could go to one of the local bars."
Tracker says 951k restored since Beryl. Who wants to bet it magically shoots up to their 1 million goal right before midnight?
"Ppl out here dying bro im at 7625 hammely blvd, and a lady died upstairs she didn't have her breathing machine"
"Make sure to keep updating the thread when your power turns back on guys. Maybe I'm missing them, but I haven't seen anything in the past few hours about a new location getting power back. We have enough people from all across Houston to PROVE that CenterPoint isn't doing their job. They claim they are working ""16 hours shifts"" and I personally think that's a load of garbage."
Just discovered from a FB group that someone has created a Google form for Houstonians to report power status. The [map](https://digital-client.com/) updates once an hour. Centerpoint can suck it.
"It's Friday and I have no idea if I'll get power today, or in August.

Heck of a job, Centerpoint."
This updated map is a complete JOKE!!!!
Why remove the thread that was strictly for people regaining power? Everyone saying they're still in the dark just makes it harder to find helpful information.
"I'm in 77006, midtown. A good chunk of us are without power, me since 6am. I feel like a lot of people have it, so I think they are moving on to larger fixes that can power more people. I would imagine they are just swatting big numbers. But, I am just going off of acedotal Ike."
"I know they are working through the night, but is that preliminary work to help them for tomorrow, or do I have a chance of all my lights turning on at 1am?"

"ERCOT updated outages this evening, most got new dates of 7/12 1700 return to service from original stubs of 7/9 1700.  Some equipment came back today, including two big 345kV lines across the city.  Scheduled outages for tomorrow are likely necessary to re-energize portions of west Houston around i10w/bw8 and around Pasadena and Humble all around 1300 tomorrow.  Big lines remain out in west Houston, Bellaire, and Deer Park.  Galveston saw some lines come back but major 138kV's remain out.  Outage ticket times are guesses in these cases, don't take them too seriously.

This information comes from ERCOT's MIS system which is somewhat archaic and difficult to use.

Sorry I don't have better news."
"77477 , 48 hours without power. Pray for me, i got a pregnant wife. All the other buildings in my complex have power besides ours. Some next level bullshit."
77008 - Heights and 18th power JUST came back on. Spread the word
"Bro, *where are the linemen?*"
"Drove around a bit and have not seen a single repair truck today. 

What the fuck are they even doing?"
I just moved here literally 7/1 from Buffalo ny. In Buffalo I have been thru blizzards with way more damage and wind.. and I have never in my life experienced a place with power that goes so easily. Put some power lines in the mega road structures every dollar is being wasted on. This is infuriating
"Any updates for heights 77008

Update : still no damn power"
"I still can’t believe I’m going through another Ike sweat fest 16 years later for a cat 1 hurricane. Our utilities infrastructure quality has regressed unchecked. 

Edit: 77035 Orange Gang rise up"
"Please email this thread to media, upload it to a server and print hard copies before you take it down. By the time anyone cares to have formal investigations, both txlege and centerpointless will have asses covered."
Well strap in for another night...
Day 5 and don't even have so much as an ETA. Fuck Centerpoint
77077 energy corridor. Had a power outage since 6:30am. Just received power now at 10pm
Still no power in 77019 Montrose area. It is now 1:02 am. No power for about 14 hours.
[deleted]
"So at 8AM, CenterPoint said there were almost 1,400,000 customers without power. The latest update says that they've restored power to ONLY 28,000 people. This is absurd."
"So if my location doesn't have an estimated time of restoration, I should give up all hope for tonight, right?"
Got an email from CP stating power was back on. Online my account says the power is on. I drove to my house and the power is still out. Enraging.
"77055 I’m fucking losing it man. 6 days no power post derecho. Day I get power my dad fucking dies and now this. Fuck center point, fuck abbott fuck them all I can’t keep this up man"
77024 woke up with my power back at around 3am.
"The ""customers restored in the last 24 hours"" metric is falling pretty quickly"
"You should leave this up for another TWO weeks, given that there will still be people waiting by then."
"77471 Rosenberg finally has power, I want to freaking cry.

Don't trust them lads, once things calm down start saving up for a generator and window AC. A lot of us might be good now but I don't trust them to be ready the next time a storm comes along. But more importantantly vote. them. Out!

Never again are we sleeping drenched in sweat desperately calling every overbooked hotel in a 100 mile radius thanks to these bozos."
The lack of updates over night and into the morning is distressing.
"Lord its raining again. I never got power back, I'm just gonna assume I won't get power back for yet another week at this point."
"77077 energy corridor, briar forest Eldridge area. Power on as of 2:19 pm 7/12. Im at a hotel but my ring camera is on and I can see that my modem is on. Hope everyone else in the area gets their power soon🤞"
“Pending review”….man fuck
"If ""restoration date pending review"" means ""sometime after July 19th"" I'm going to throw literal shit at Centerpoint execs."
I'm in the Humble area 77396...completely pitch black and sounding like jurassic park outside with the insects.
77071 without power for about 20 hrs. Center point says that by WEDNESDAY they’ll have 1M back in service but there’s close to 2M without power. I’m frustrated 🤕
77006 by substation on tuam/fairview power back on woo!!!!! Instead of sad drinking we are happy drinking!!!! Woooooo!!!!!
"77007 Washington/Memorial - still no power or running water. Is any one else without water, or am I just in an unlucky pocket? All businesses and other apt complexes around me have power tho"
"Anecdotally, it seems like the repairs are slowing down.  Only one of my friends had their power restored."
77060 but I don’t mind waiting. My heart goes out to those most at risk and with pets. I’ll live.
"Welp, looks like another night of sweating. Turns out the first 3 houses on our side of the street have power so the problem is a particular post behind the 3rd neighbors house. We've been classified as light green or mostly energized so I imagine we aren't priority and won't get power till next week. Fuck Centerpoint."
"Mom in Richmond, I’m in Westchase, no power. Sister just outside River Oaks has power, but no water. How a nearly non-hurricane did this makes no sense to this lifelong Houstonian."
"I'm in 77096. My neighbors across the street from me have power and those on my side do not. There are countless instances of this exact same thing all across Houston, and it really makes no sense.
CenterPoint admitted they weren't prepared because ""the storm was worse than predicted"". I'm sorry, but during the time of year when we regularly hit TRIPLE DIGITS in temperature, you'd think these morons over at CenterPoint would prepare for the worst.
While I'm writing this because I'm bored and don't have shit else to do, I also think someone needs to be held accountable for this mess.
Almost 1.5 million people are still without power."
Anyone know any updates on Harris County areas because this is ridiculous.
77057 by the galleria and we’ve been out of power since monday 9:30am currently 5:44am tuesday and woke up sweating. i really worry about my cats and how they’ll do tomorrow:(
Got the email from Centerpoint in 77063 saying our power was restored. Tis a lie.
77008 behind Torchy's...power on!
"77090, no power. Been here for Allison, Ike, Rita, all of them. I've never been without power this long. In a hotel that I can't afford and I started vacation today. Thankful I don't have to work during this time but bitter I can't spend it in my apt. "
"Yall I cannot

I haven't slept a wink all night, just crying and be nauseated. I'm sleeping on a palette in my parents bedroom. They're running a portable ac unit off a generator. Even then somehow I managed to either get upset to my stomach or get heat exhaustion

I just need someone to talk to in the darkness. My parents are asleep:("
F\*ck centerpoint and their negligent behavior and intentional lack of transparency.
"As of 7/11 8:40PM…:.They are shutting power back off in some areas in Missouri City, drove by whataburger and it was pitch black…(it was opened yesterday)….I politely drove home and laid back down In the DARK. ATT Internet is down, can’t work from home, TMOBLE cellphone towers down , operating on LTE …can’t call customer service without having to repeat each word over and over and over again. Bout to lay in the dark and suck my thumb 👍!!!!"
77064 power out again… HAHAHAHAHA what a joke… you have to laugh to stop yourself from crying… fucking ridiculous
so… does anyone know the likelihood of someone in a “partially energized” area getting power back any time soon if there aren’t even people out working on the downed lines yet…? because their map is starting to look more like centerpoint jerking themselves off marking outages as restored because a couple of commercial buildings have power on the circuit 😭
for giving “substantially everyone” an estimation there’s still a lot of people with no ETA on that map.
Bru my shit say july 12 … its 10:47pm u mfs im STILL IN THE DARK
"77008 14th street near heights high school - electric crew said everything here is fixed, they are just running tests for safety to turn it all back on today - guess we'll wait and see

For reference, this area is marked on the centerpoint map as needing review for restoration date and was previously marked ""energized"""
77008 no power. In laws in 77005 no power. Really contemplating heading to the hill country tomorrow to stay with my parents.
77006 Centerpoint trucks spotted in the northeast quadrant of Montrose. One was stopped on Avondale

Centerpoint on break? The tracker has been stuck at 1.36 million since I woke up at 6.
77007 near cleveland park. Saw a guy working on the electricity lines! Here’s hoping it gets fixed today
"The guy who commented a few hours ago with some insider info on transmission line repairs has added a noteworthy update to his comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/lcik1fn/

"The transmission-line insider guy added another update to his comment this morning: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/lcik1fn/

> UPDATE4: 0915 on 7/11:

> * Not a ton of changes overnight, mainly times updated for work going on today. Work end around noontime in areas: Greenspoint, Lake Houston/BW8, central Pasadena, 59/Fannin (ends 1700), and Addicks. These are all breaker outages generally related to re-energization of the high kV (read: big) lines.

> * All of the major 345kV lines have been back while one major 138kV line crossing town from 290/610 through the Heights to Beaumont remains out in two sections. This work was scheduled to come back last night at 2200 and did not, no new estimate.

> * One major 345kV xfmr [transformer] is out of service near 290/610 along the aforementioned string coming out of the Heights. This is not expected to return until 1700 on 7/13 (end of Saturday). This may be one of the reasons CNP is giving guidance for restorations continuing into Sunday.

> * While I know this all sucks so bad, the line crews did an pretty good job of restoring the high kV lines ahead of schedules in most cases. The problem is increasingly going to the last few miles of low kV distribution lines that feed your street. That means each line fixed is increasingly less 'bang for the buck' in terms of customers restored, simply because they've hit most of the big ones."
Starting to think 77024 is one of the worst zip codes to live in when it comes to losing power . . . Last time when the derecho hit we were out of power for like 6 days
The number of affected customers has been going *up* this morning. 
77007 by St Thomas High School - no power still
Is CP just randomly changing outage map to green and increasing numbers of restored customers in the tracker? Wtf 😂
"Day 6 of no power, ""energized"" with no power, not a single electrical truck on the road. I don't know how everyone in Richmond/Rosenberg has power, but us. Genuinely wondering if legal action can be taken at this point."
You would think with so many people having power again the rest of the repairs would go faster since theres more people to work on things... 
77498 Fort Bend still out. Been out since 5am
"Pinehurst area, 77355 (magnolia). Pitch black, no T-Mobile data at all. Drove into Tomball and as soon as I crossed into Harris County, the lights and cell internet are on.

New Zealand came in just fine on Shortwave radio tonight."
No power in 77479 (Sugar Land) for 24 hours now. We have guests from out of town. Welcome to Texas!
77007 power came back a few minutes ago. Enjoying the ceiling fan while I can. Hope it stays on long enough for the AC to do some work.
POWER RESTORED TO MY NEIGHBORHOOD IN 77033! YIPPEEEE
"77092 and feeling like I'm one of those unlucky ones part of the 'nested outage' since 80% of neighbors have had lights since Tuesday. I just wish I knew what the time line for fixing everything was, feeling so sick of all the sweaty, dark waiting."
77003 power restored. We need to talk about holding centerpoint accountable.
"***Update**** 

Power back on but not all houses on Dickson unfortunately (per my HOA)


77007 still nothing (right by St. Thomas HS). I was already planning to move but am in the middle of fixing a few things up with a contractor. This experience makes me realize I don’t care if I sell at a loss, I’m gtfo. I moved here the year of Harvey and I’m leaving with Beryl."

"After nearly 190 hours, power is finally back on at 77004 near 288/mcgowen"
"Centerpoint is saying that they'll be up to 1 million restored ~~tomorrow~~ by EOD Wednesday. Right now they're just under 300k from the initial 2.2m, so you have about 35-40% odds of getting your power restored by then if you're still out."
77504 power came back and then 40 mins later a branch fell and cut our power FML
"Hot, sweaty miserable. My freezer is leaking everywhere. Will have to toss a bunch of food! For the 3rd time in a year. I feel like shit. Didn’t sleep a wink. I am so fucking angry right now. Also just learned that Centerpoint is just now starting to send out crews… 26 hours later. Fuck everything right now lol."
Where the Phuck are all the center point truck repairs when no one can find them anywhere repairing 
At least 3 admits to our medical service today related to no AC. Bullshit. Our elderly and sick deserve better.
"77008 lost power around 9am, still nothing"
"77007, pls tell me it's possible to get power turned on during the night. I'm trying to cool off any way I know how, but I can't sleep and I have an elderly parent with me. 
I know there are 3 cooling centers open for tomorrow, but does anyone know of any more ? "
Power just came on at 12:45 am in 77062.
"77054, still out :("
77056 - my apartment complex has power back! Got the email about 30 minutes ago.
"Just got a Center point text saying our power was restored, which is FALSE."
77006 near Rudyards. No power for my whole street yet. We all lost it about 10 AM yesterday. All the houses and business around us have power. It’s maddening.
[deleted]
77006 in a small pocket of three houses + a parking lot with no power but literally everyone around us is lit up 😭. Worried about my cats.
"77379 right by KHS still no power 50 hours in. We’ve done a good bit of driving around and have not seen a single utility truck on the roads, in parking lots, or working in the areas we have driven through."
"No power still in my area. Ironically tho I’m driving down Wesleyan towards the Greenway Plaza Costco and encounter several downed lines just laying in the right lane of the road only to see about a dozen lineman trucks with dudes inside just chilling in the Costco parking lot less than a minute drive away.

I know these dudes are there and ready to work. How the fuck is CP management failing this bad at organizing their labor?"
77008 any updates near 14th? We’re starting to get nauseous and the pets aren’t eating. This is WITH a generator and window unit. It’s still 89 in here
I'm about to crash out
Would be nice if any linemen were lurking here on a dinner break and could give some info.
"77098 no power still.. we are literally one of the  buildings within our complex that still doesnt have power. They have no clue when itll be resolved.

Happy for our neighbors and I’m trying to remain positive, but its starting to get to me 🥹"
77379 - still no power :(. I'm tired of this.
[deleted]
77066 - We're free. Power is on.
77056 still no power since Monday 9am and it’s Tuesday 2:50am now 😩
"77095, lost power at around 6-7am .. came back on at about 6pm and then back out again at around 8pm. It’s 3:30am now and still out 😢"
"77077, power just clicked on at 5 am. I've never been happier!"
Supposedly the crews that finally made it are getting their safety briefing this morning. We should start seeing power restored soon (slowly)
77095 checking again. No power but went out and drove some and zero sign of centerpoint trucks. Love it
Crying in 77450 Cinco Ranch/Highland knolls. Some areas around Kingsland seem to have power but nothing here. Finally pulled the trigger on a generator—-I don’t want to do this again! Dogs and cats and humans are all miserable 😭.
My entire street in the Heights is green on the map but I don’t have power and in fact have a downed line in my yard. How can I make sure I’m not passed over? I am terrified they think I have power somehow because all of my neighbors do
Taking my dog to a friends house in San Marcos. Very thankful for the people in my life. Keep your pets safe. 
"They changed the map sometime this afternoon. Energized got broken into ""energized"" and ""energized with potential nested outage"". Most of what was energized was migrated into the second category, of course"
"66hrs still no power spring 77379 wires blocking the entrance northwest memorial, 0 work done ."
"77077 - briar forest and d. ashford - still no power as of 5am Monday.
The neighborhood across from us - 77079 - never lost power. We’re staying with them until power gets restored or until they kick us out.. whichever comes first.

I haven’t seen a single service truck all week. I’ve been going back and forth cleaning, emptying the refrigerator, checking mail, etc.


I have a hunch CP over extended themselves from the last storm and the linemen are hesitant to return due to open/unpaid invoices. That’s just my opinion. I work in the services industry."
77036 Forum Park still in the dark it’s crazy. 90° inside the buildings when it’s 9PM at night. Madness. ^FUCKCENTERPOINT
"It's 12 PM. Tick-tock, Centerpoint."
"Power flickered twice here, just wow. 77008"
"77006 (Montrose). Had power restored early Wednesday. My parents (77346) had power restored Wednesday but lost it for ~2 hours today before it came back on. Brother (77346, in the same neighborhood my parents are in) got power back about 15 minutes ago. Sister (77396) still has no power. Xfinity is still out for everyone.   

Driving home from work today, I'd say >50% of street lights remain out, including multiple downtown intersections on Louisiana; Westheimer and Montrose; and West Gray and Waugh. Be careful -- asswipes are running intersections left and right without even pretending to stop. I messaged my boss I'm not coming in tomorrow. It's not worth it. 

Side note: I gassed up on Friday at $3.49/gallon for premium. Today I paid $4.59."
Still no power in 77040. I’m pissed because people down the street have power but not here
Well.. this storm just set us back 😩 i saw 3 lineman working 77090 then boom.. gone 😭😭😭😭
77024. By Chimney Rock and I-10. No one is even in the area lmao. Leaving Houston after this.
I was in the partially energized zone of the map until now. They have us in that shade of teal that is pending date
77373 - Some houses have power
"On a walk this morning I saw at least 6 work trucks in a very small area, east of Heights between 20th and 17th. Hopefully y'all get it back real soon."
77017 near Hobby Airport/Pasadena still down since 6am…..praying that sleep takes me soon and that I wake up to AC lol
Whataburgers always have power. We should just put them in charge of the grid honestly. They’d probably do a better job than Centerpoint.
"CenterPoint has not done a good job keeping us updated.  Clear and specific information that we were used to during previous outages has been replaced with generic ""updates"" this time around.  It's frustrating that CenterPoint took down the outage map.  It feels like the company is withholding information."
The Whataburger app coming in clutch is something I did not expect lmao
Feeling depressed I don't want to go through another night with no power I have work I can't clean my uniform or take a shower. I can't book a room with no availability and I can't leave town. I feel like a trapped rat. 77011
I can’t believe a category 1 took the power out for this long. I just moved to Houston in May from Florida 🥲
"> Based on current progress with its damage assessment and initial restoration, CenterPoint now expects to have 1 million impacted customers restored by the end of the day on Wednesday, July 10.

So not even half the people are expected to have power by end of Wednesday according to them"
"77024 @ Memorial & Chimney Rock. No power since the early AM. Took 6 days to get power back after the derecho, but I’m hopeful we’ll get it sooner this time around"
[deleted]
77095 still out. Not a truck in sight. And my solar fans just died after running like champs since the outage. But I can’t recharge until sun comes up. It’s so hot and stuffy in here. I feel so gross.
77007 still no power
The number of customers affected went up 😭
"77008, W 23rd and Bevis

Just got power back. Looks like the updates from the crews being there was accurate."
[deleted]
It would help a lot if when posting your status you include the closest major intersection.
77459 - neighborhood near HEB on Austin parkway + hwy6 has power 
any updates on 77008?
"The insider guy who commented about transmission lines this morning added another update to his comment, about 45min ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/lcik1fn/

> UPDATE2: 1635 on 7/10:

> * lines from Addicks to WP/BW8 to Bellaire are out of service as expected, given a return time of 1900 tonight. We'll see. If you lost power this afternoon along those areas, that's probably why.

> * work on a major crosstown 138kV line through the Heights to Crosby is going out this evening (1630) and expected back at 2200. This is likely to go out or may already be out, hopefully come back later tonight.

> * some major work on the east side near the ship channel finished.

> * work near 290/BW8 Cyprus area finished early (was slated for 7/12)"
"For those in 77008, I’m driving to dinner and I saw a bunch of out of state utility trucks near 11th street park, and another set near ETC Jester and Wynnwood"
"77054, 8181 Fannin St, power was back at 6 pm. Thank you to the lineworkers (men and women) who worked under high temperatures the entire day. Hope that everyone here will get their power back soon."
77070 my 249ers and cypresswood ppl we are back up 🎉🎉🎉🎉
77379 near grand parkway and kuykendahl. Still no power despite the whataburger and other businesses across the way having it :'(
77008 back on at 7 PM on Wednesday at Shepherd and 16th
"77477. Of course, the Starbucks and Mcdonalds right behind my house have power and stay blasting their bright ass lights through my windows.

Sleeping on my roof in nothing but my undies has been quite pleasant, though. I've been getting stares from the McD's drive thru, but fuck em."
77007 washington ave still no power…
77007 near Cleveland park. I see repair crew! However they are not center point - I guess they are contracting in some outside help? These pics were taken on Jackson hill https://imgur.com/a/wo7nlGs
"77379 So much for Centerpoint providing restoration times on it's ""restoration status tracker"" before noon today as promised. No updates to the shitty map since 7am. Not that I'm surprised."
"Centerpoint said they'd have estimated times to fix power, where is that supposed to be at?"
"NEW MAP UPDATED. 

77070 - Cypresswood and Cutten - No ETA :( (me)

77379 - off Louetta - 7/12 (tomorrow). (parents)"
I'm seeing that some of you guys have gotten estimates on when your power will come back; where are y'all getting them? Was it an email from Centerpoint?
just got power back on 77459 near Lexington/dulles!
"Still no power 77007. It’s time to start bombarding them with calls https://fletcher.house.gov/forms/form/?ID=103
7133538680 can everyone start calling their rep and whoever else they can think of? This is absurd. At least we can be a pain in the ass or a mild irritation to these people who don’t give a f if thousands start calling nonstop?? I don’t see any other alternative besides the French way but we need to take our anger outside of this app and put it directly on those who are supposed to do something. Like they shouldn’t have the phone stop ringing for a minute until this is over. If you were in office, isn’t that what you’d be expecting?"
seems they don’t get much done overnight.
"77019 - Power restored (at least on La Rue street by Waugh & W. Dallas). 

FYI - we’ve been in blue since they released the map. They never gave an estimate for when power would be restored. The map still shows us as blue. 

I feel so so grateful 😭😭 I’m praying all my fellow Houstonians/texans get their power restored ASAP! This was hell "
[deleted]
Yeahhhh the storm that's blowing through NWHouston rn is giving me major anxiety.  I'll probably have a meltdown if my power goes out again...
77063 hopeless 😩 
"We are live in 77007, Yale & Washington"
"77092 @ Magnum and Pinemont

I'm done with today. Just chased half a Xanax with a shot of tequila.

Hoping to wake up tmrw with power but not holding my breath."
"77007, Washington Ave. across from Porta'Vino. No power or water since ~9:30 A.M. Monday."
Serious question: how the fuck has a state of emergency/disaster not been called yet? Nearly 50% of the population loses power in sure people could use those resources such as FEMA etc at this point. This city is so frustrating sometimes.
"50% of Entergy customers are supposed to be back on by Wednesday evening. 

For reference, when Beryl was a category 4 that hit Jamaica, 45% of JPS (Jamaica’s power company) customers had power within 24 hours.

How on earth is the 4th largest city in the US and “energy capital” doing worse than an island for power restoration? Maybe I should move back to the East coast…"
No hate but it's unhelpful to say power is up in your zip without a cross street or landmark.
77036 power went out around 6am and i don't have power back yet.
77004.  Down since 9:30 am and not back on yet
77006 still out despite the people across the street having power. can’t even bother trying to reach centerpoint. what a jokep
"77009, lost power shortly after 8 this morning and haven’t gotten it back."
"77433 no power since 6am, family in 77429, 77070 and 77354 all still no power"
77006 near Milam still no power
Power back in 77375
"77008, no power, my front complex has power, but no power in the back 😞😞😞😞😞"
"77006, still no power but got a power spike at 3:50ish"
77008 no power since 9:30 yesterday
77459 - I saw crews working at the towers by hightower high school
"77074 Shapstown bellaire side, we're still out of power, and it keeps getting hotter. I'm hoping it comes back today. Looks like I'm missing spain v france in the Euros. Damn it."
77006 - Power is ON! Camden Midtown (Milam and Louisiana at Hadley). And there was much rejoicing.
[deleted]
So did anyone get power back during the night last night? Like is it possible that they’re working overnight or do we give up hope until tomorrow? Thanks!
77056 everyone in neighborhoods around us has power but we’re still without 🥺
"77066: contractors (?) in trucks marked ""Premium"" spotted. Two small fleets, both near Hobby Lobby on FM 1960. At around 8:30 am, one group was having a very large huddle/meeting. We hope they will fix residential power in short order..."
I think they forgot about 77057. All three of the closest traffic lights are out and I‘m over here with nothing but a tiny fan and little power bank keeping me cool slowly losing the will to live
Anyone else see the restoration counter on the outage tracker just jump from 985k to 1 mill mere minutes before the 5 pm deadline? Can't make this shit up.
77006 just got home to confirm. Hallelujah
77008 near SPJST Lodge just got power back
"77008 - Spoke to a lineman, the repairs don’t start until tomorrow morning."
77070 near Cutten and Cypresswood. Nothing. Lots around me has power but this section don’t. Seen a few trucks so hoping it’s soon.
(77070)Another day sleeping in the car since there’s no power in our area but few blocks away got power 😔😩
77007 near Cleveland park still out 😡
77069/Willowbrook area here. Does anyone have any updates specifically for that part of 1960?
77008 checking in at TC and Bevis and power is back
"77003. No power, going on day four. A shit sandwich "
"77459 - Just did a drive around Sienna. There is gas available at the HEB on 6, the Shell just into Sienna and the Valero on the corner of Hwy 6 and Sienna Ranch. As for power, the stores on Hwy 6, at the front of Sienna, and the apartments around the Shell gas station all have power. On Sienna Ranch there was power on one side of the road, spanning from Sienna Springs to Fort Bend Tollway, had power, along with the apartments near Hwy 6.

I saw linemen working near the Shell, as well as the substation on Mount Logan, just after the roundabout.

Small update: there is still a lineman truck at the Mount Logan substation"

"77388 still no power, although its been blue since yesterday. Also areas around our neighborhood are expected to be back up by end of day tomorrow…."
Ah great. This little rain is gonna turn into a 24 hour lunch break for Centercrap.
77096 JUST GOT POWER BACK ON!!
77571 - There was a large tree blocking the only BOULEVARD in and out of our neighborhood. Neighbor just texted the tree is gone and what appeared to be guys starting line work.
"77339 no power, no hope"
"77069 - champions forest & cypresswood area. Mom just got power back!! So happy for her & everyone else getting power back :) 

hoping 77098 gets power back soon 🤞"
[deleted]
77042 - Power just came back. Hold strong friends.
77447- the map is saying energized but no one in my neighborhood has power. What should be done? I know people have said the map is inaccurate but now it is showing estimated dates for restoration. Ours is just saying energized when that is not the case.
New map says we’re energized in 77012 and 77061 but totally dark. I fucking give up.
Bro how tf does everyone outside my neighborhood have power and and just my neighborhood doesn’t complete and utter bull shiiiii
77007 near St Thomas HS. Still no power. Fuckity fuckin dark ages and shit
I’m 90% sure it’s just a transformer that needs replacing. Why is it taking so long?
"77379 - bunch of linemen staged in the parking lot of the Klein ISD therapeutic and readiness center, im near the elementary school here and without power. A tree Batista bombed a pole and took out another across the street."
77008 15th and Columbia just got power. Hope y’all still waiting get help soon.
77054 got power back today. latest map estimated it'll be the 17th. just letting everyone know to disregard what centerpoint puts out.
"Not getting power until Friday wtf man life sucks but aleast there's a date for me, somebody probably already robbed my house already because eveyone left my neighborhood to go somewhere else I'm going to check on it today"
77023. Just got a call from CP my expected restoration time is Friday by end of day. End me please.
"[Here is the update from CenterPoint](https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/releases/Hurricane_Beryl_7.8.24%20PM_Final.pdf)

They said half of the outages should be fixed by Wednesday…"

So this is what it felt like living in Houston pre AC.
taking a sweaty dump as I type this in the dark. FML
"77090 still no power. Nobody cares. Not a single lineman, repair crew or truck. Crickets. 
I honestly think they've forgotten about us and once Centerpointless was done with that 1 million restored on Wednesday they just went back to their usual uncomplicated lives.


This is one very very fucked up city. Houston weak should be the new slogan."
Sorry if this has been shared already but here is a [self-reported outage map](https://digital-client.com/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR1XPyE9cGc23BJzIsNOZLJ6bLDSp2X_iIlt67TOXpR2dhOoCvHJkNU10eE_aem_vEXzpOW63Wfm46k0hNSK1w&mibextid=UyTHkb) that seems to be more accurate than Centerpoint’s
Can we all band together and just not pay Centerpoint this month?
 77095 still out. Hoping for the best th
"https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/


I have no idea if these numbers are just made up, but if accurate there has been steady but very slow progress over the past 6-8 hours."
No pour in 77058 since 4:30am yesterday. It’s been over 24 hours and it’s just gonna get hotter 🥲
77007 near St Thomas High School had power come on for 20 seconds and then it shut off again.  Hopefully it comes back soon.
"77388 which is kuykendahl to i45 in spring, still has no power. The heb and shopping areas have power, but the neighborhoods and apartment complexes are still out."
77070 still without power to my knowledge. I hope we're not part of the multiple days club...
77095 Copper lakes. Centerpoint truck just drove by. They waved at us PLEASEEEEEEEEEE PLEASEEEEEEEE
"Saw two line trucks on the corner of Cullen and Leland, hopefully 77003 and 77023 will be back soon"
Got power back but now xfinity is down suddenly.
Accepted I may not get power till like Friday probably at this point. Anyone have ANY tips to cool down when trying to sleep. I’m all sticky and sweating profusely. My feet are on fire!
"77070


Still no power in my building but several buildings around me have power. At least my complex's office has power so I have somewhere to charge phone and power bank. The animal clinic i work at has power so if anyone needs help with their pet in 77433 area, pm me for the phone number. As far as I know, we're only seeing sick patients since our vaccines had to be thrown out. "
Probably about 10-12 linesman utility trucks at the shopping center at 1960 and breck at in champions area I just saw. Might be working on that area today. 77066 area code btw
77070 still no power and cell service still bad.  Drove around last night and most traffic lights were not working.  Lakewood Forest area.  Kroger on Grant and Louetta had power and was open last night.  The gas stations that were open had no gas or bags of ice as of last night.
77008 - 23rd & East side of Yale got power back about 5 minutes ago.
Anyone around 77025 Southside Place need a food or water run? Happy to deliver something between my meetings today.
"77007 Cottage Grove - just reported a downed line that was pretty hidden away and I think had gone unnoticed until now. Centerpoint said they’d send a crew ASAP, but we’ll see what happens……"
Stafford SW Houston 77477 area POWER UP 7/11/24 about 4AM
77095 just got power! Hope everyone else gets theirs back soon!! I love seeing how united we've been in calling out bs. I really wanna keep this energy going forward bc I keep learning more and more about all this bs affecting us and I don't want to go back to just being clueless
That map isn’t accurate. Updated or not it shows that my work doesn’t have power but im here and it does. Thank god cuz it says my home won’t be restored until 7/14 and I refuse to believe that.
Anyone have an update for 77055 specifically by Kroger? I really don’t get why Kroger and the community center don’t have power. It is a missed opportunity to not give the community center power and make it a cooling center for people.
"77077 Dairy Ashford/Westheimer area in the Energy Corridor. Lost power 530am Monday. I drove 2 hours away to get myself and my baby to a hotel and have no contacts in the area. Have been checking my AT&T smart home manager app to see if my internet modem is back online to check for power. About 20 minutes ago, it was showing my modem back online and was getting good speeds. Then it went back offline about 7 minutes later. Seems like power came back and shut off again unless it had a power surge and quacked out. It is not plugged into a surge protector."
"77389 - just received this message from off-point

FROM: CenterPoint Energy: Crews continue to work around the clock to complete power restorations daily. Based on the status of active restoration work, we estimate your power to be restored by the end of the day, Friday, July 12. Please know restorations will be happening daily and you may be restored earlier.

Edit : now they are saying Saturday"
"77077 - briar forest & Kirkwood, still without power since 7/8 @ 10am"
"77049, still nothing but I'm about to power my whole neighborhood on rage alone."
"77035 Central Westbury just got power back!!! Linemen trucks are all over the place, there is hope!!!"
77008 still without power TC Jester & 11th
77373 Checking in - Still no power in this neighborhood at all.
"77066 - Hollister near Beltway 8/249, 8 AM Friday:

My house in Champions Point Village II is still without power, but the corner store on Bourgeois and Hollister has power as do the traffic lights at that intersection and at Theall & Hollister.

Swanny's at Hollister & Theall is lit up, and the business parks along Theall are all energized.

Give me hope our subdivision will get power today.  I saw a LOT of bucket trucks going north on Hollister."
Back at work in 77008 with no power in a dark and hot warehouse. It's depressing driving through a city in ruins just to work in this shithole building.
"77008 update near high school on 14th - no power yet but crews finally working on removing a large tree sitting on some lines behind a house - really hoping that's been the problem

UPDATE - still no power"
"Jfc... I work from home and just got an alert from IT: ""your computer hasn't backed up in a while and we wanted to check that it's working"" I let them know I'm in the area still without power because of the hurricane and the response was basically ""ok well just ping us when that passes"""
"77386, got power back yesterday afternoon but it just went back out. I'm so done with this..."
"77096, beechnut and south rice just got power back"
77339- Bear Branch. I spoke to a line worker just now and he told me it would be until at least Monday til the power is back. He said it was some of the worst tree damage he had seen.
77379 - Cypresswood and Kuykendall. There's two snapped poles on front of the CVS. One still has part of a tree on it. Haven't seen any trucks come around yet.
We got power back on at 6:30 only for it to go out 20min later. 77088 zip code. New map says we’re energized. Also looks like some folks won’t be getting it back till Tuesday or later of next week. This is insane
77086 - new map says restoration pending review. If we're after the 19th me and my mom will for sure be dead by then
"Love being surrounded by dates and my building still rocks the ""Further review"" tag. Thank you Centerpoint. Really cool really chill. Love it."
[deleted]
WHY IS MY ETA THE 17TH
"77489. Power just came back. Was given no estimated time yesterday. And on today’s update was given until the EOD 17th. So I guess the map is kind of useless.


I did end up flagging down a CenterPoint lineman and asked what was being worked on near me and when I could get power back. He mentioned a tree was tangled on the line and that, that alone would make power return - unless something else major happened that hasn’t been discovered.


I will say, that we lost power at 2AM when Beryl made landfall and never even got a taste of electricity until today. I hope everyone else without it gets it soon, and if anyone needs assistance with anything hmu."
77459 Lake Olympia (or at least our part of it) has power again!! Just came back up about an hour ago and CP had sent us a text message that it would be back up by tomorrow. A day sooner than expected.
"77586 - Seabrook/El Lago.  Finally powered up after 6 long, miserable days.  During the final hookup this afternoon, the line to my complex needed a new switch because the one up there couldn't hold the voltage needed and the supervisor said it may not be tonight.  My heart sank, but luckily they were able to install one shortly after and we are in good shape.  My wife and our dog are at the hotel while I clean up the apartment, make sure everything works and spend some quality time with our cats who are currently fighting over who gets my lap. 

I hope those of you still without power are alright and you get restored soon.  I've been through Allison, Ike and Harvey prior.  Lost my apartment during Harvey.  This was still the worst one I've been through up to this point.  This sucked."
"Nested outages are fucked, I guess. We’re the only block in our neighborhood with no power (77084). Hit 0 when calling to talk to a human who told us our status was “waiting for crew assignment” before pausing and saying “so probably not today”. It’s a blown transformer with literally nothing around it. No damage. Just fucked. And the map won’t even give us a date because we’re “energized”."
"77373. Spring. The map shows us to be energized but no power here. The drone of the generators is still ongoing.


I cut the mains on and left all the other breakers off save on - the one that sends power to the back porch lights.


There are several bucket trucks driving around here right now. Fingers crossed!"
77007 power back at 11am this morning.
"77086 - got power back yesterday evening, slept 12 hours immediately"
77018 relief has never felt this good. Fingers crossed it stays!
Is there any way to find out an ETA from Center Point? We need to decide soon if we need to leave or stick it out. This is crazy. We’ve been without power for 38 hours.
"When you all can, start saving money so you can leave Texas. This will only get worse."
Just heard lightening. Everyone’s about to lose power again.
Rumor is that centerpoint has hundreds of trucks not yet deployed as it negotiates their pay.
77578 just got power
Out now for over 12 hours in 77098
77379 down since 6:45 am. Just enjoying the sound of all our neighbors generators
Nada in 77054
"https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/

centerpoint outage tracker
my neighborhood(77081) lost power like 4am, when Beryl got cause I randomly woke up at 5 and there was no power"
"77494 (on the very edge/inner-99 side): 2 streets in our neighborhood has power, but we do not. Traffic lights out at 99/westheimer but fully functional at westheimer/peek. 

We had centerpoint roll through our neighborhood 4 hours ago and then…. nothing for us."
77063 no power or water since 6am
"77041, West rd and 290, power restored 10:45."
"77069 - power has been out since 9 am. We have a generator running (I’m sharing it with my neighbors) but it’s hell without AC.  
Tomorrow I’ll decide if I’ll head to Austin"
77024 lost power around 6am still nothing
"77469 still no power since 6am and service has been spotty as hell, I've only been able to get so much as a Google search off maybe twice all day. Verizon."
Hopefully it’s back before it gets too much warmer 
"77084 one half of the apartment complex has power, the other doesn't... We on the side without it..."
"77023 still the only one without power on my street


Edit: it appears an air bnb behind my house is also without power. They are also sandwiched by folks with electricity"
"Friendswood, 77546. Haven’t had power since 7 AM Monday. I’m fucking miserable, attempting to sleep in my car. We’ll see if I run out of gas 🤷🏻‍♂️ drove around for 4 hours going to hotels / motels I thought were open or had a room but all were closed or had no power."
"GOOF area, lost power for a week in april, had to toss out everything in the fridge, ground hogs day all over again."
77038 no power still and I haven’t slept at all. It’s sooooo hot
77450 fort bend and i havent had power for over 27 hours. this is ridiculous
"77009, still no power as of now, going on 24 hours without.

Have not seen a single CenterPoint truck (or any other line crews) between the Heights and Katy."
77096 Still no power
77008. Just saw a bunch of centerpoint trucks drive by the hotel im at into the neighborhood. Hopefully a good sign.
"77090 no power since 8 am yesterday. Drove along 1960 from Kuykendahl to 45 yesterday afternoon, no traffic lights and no power anywhere. Found one Honduran restaurant open, waiting time was 45 minutes. Have not seen a single repair crew, truck, utility. Frustration is building up. 


77073 where I work does not have either power or water."
77389- spring/gosling area still no power
Got an email from Centerpoint about 2 hrs ago saying crews are in the area for my address. I was sleeping so just saw this. 77040 around Hollister St on the East side of 290. I'll go drive around and see if that's hogwash like it probably is. Though I am hopeful since we were one of the last to get power in May.
"After 30 hours, my part of 77083 has power"
Got power back just now - West U.
77008. Drove by the house and around Yale/Heights. No power N of 11th E of Yale. Didnt see any crews but given the wide area out they might be working at the source. On the plus side didnt see much evidence of widespread damage to poles and lines.
"77045 still no power in the residential areas, but there is power on parts of West Orem and West Fuqua. I saw a few gas stations up and running. 

Saw one Centerpoint truck during my tour of the neighborhood. It didn't appear to be doing anything. I guess they were still assessing damage and/or waiting for instructions."
"temp check, what're y'alls thermostats reading at? I'm at 80 downstairs, 82 upstairs with 75% humidity. My swamp cooler has run out of ice. Rip"
Power is back on 77006!!! Milam St and Lousiana St
77054 - Holly Hall Street power out still
I feel like if you are on the same grid as businesses you will get power today..if not good luck.
77077 - still no power since 10am yesterday
"77494 (right on the border of 77450 off westheimer)  — POWER BACK after 36 hours! House up to 85 degrees and hoping the power remains on. 

I had neighbors across the street that had their power restored 24 hours ago, so it’s been hell watching them love totally normal, non-inconvenienced lives the past day."
77070 still without power. Waaaay too hot for this
77007. Anyone near Jackson hill and Feagan? Do you guys have power? Update me if you guys get it!
"77043 west of Gessner near Spring Woods High school, no power. 
Office manager at my work just texted me power is on at work: 77092 near Mitchelldale and 43rd

Memorial City Mall is open and SLAMMED. Food
 court open but Starbucks closed .  I went to get a car charger for my phone and some food, people were charging their devices from the floor outlets.
Traffic lights are out at Gessner and I 10 and it is an accident waiting to happen. Take Bunker Hill exit the lights are working there then turn on Gaylord or Barryknoll to get to the mall.
There is a tree down blocking 1 lane on Longpoint heading east from Gessner toward Bunker hill, but the other eastbound lane is clear to get past it and the west lanes are ok. 
Valero Station on Gessner and Hammerly is open, I think the Kroger is open but not 100% on that."
"Lots of posts about 77096 back up, but I still don't have power :("
77069 is now at 36 hours without power.
"About two hours ago, I got an alert from Centerpoint saying that ""Repair crews are assessing the power issue at or near [MY EXACT ADDRESS].""

Has anyone else gotten that email and subsequently gotten their power restored?"
"My entire neighborhood has power except for 12 houses on one block.  Guess where I live? 

Why has thou forsaken me?"
"Westheimer and Fondren 

77063 

Still no power since 7am Monday."
"77518. Still no power. 

Keep getting notifications every hour or so from Centerpoint that the power to my house has been restored. Leave work, drive to house, reset circuit breaker: no power. Re-report outage.

So freaking tired of this shit."
Any update 77070?
"77008 E 26th and Harvard just got a notification from centerpoint that power is back but I’m out of town, can anyone near there confirm?"
[deleted]
"I am looking to change my apartment next month. Someone, please let me know where they fixed the electricity on the first day :p"
"77035 Central Westbury. I’ve already resigned myself to not having power until next Monday, I think we will be very lucky to get it back by the end of this week. "
77018 near N Sheperd and Pinemont still no power
"77006 near Rudyards - POWER BACK, internet (x-finity) working"
"Updates seemed to have dried up, giving up hope of getting power tonight... 77011 by Lockwood and navigation"
"Still no power for 77088, off 249 neighborhood is completely dark for 3rd night"
"77092 everyone near us seems to have power, but my appartment doesn't. The street lights are on right up until my appartment complex then turn back on again after us"
"77469 Richmond-Rosenberg, Our 3rd night without power. Fuck CenterPoint HQ, and the PUC/ERCOT"
77096: Power is back as of about 20 minutes ago. W. Belfort and Willowbend. My mom is across Chimney Rock near Belfort and still is out.
"Hey, /u/eepy_neebies_seepies  THANKS for your post!

You should add a note near the top that CenterPoint's outage map now shows estimated restoral, but you have to zoom in on your area and then left-click your mouse to have the estimate show up.

When I click on my area it doesn't give an estimate, but a mile north of us where my office is, it says by the end of the day July 13th.

Edit/Update:  Got a text and an email from CenterPoint at 1:35 PM today (Thursday) saying estimated restoral for us is by end-of-day Saturday 7/13, but could be sooner.  

Well, I hope it's sooner.  Propane is about $85 a day."
77070 lakewood FINALLY has power back. Wishing the best for those of you still left behind
77096: power now back around Chimney Rock and W. Belfort!!!
"77090 the map says end of day July 13, but my particular address has the note of “continue to provide restoration estimations as they become available.”  Quickly losing the little hope I had building today with that. Still not messages from them. "
"77088 - Inwood North, entire subdivision has power except my side of the street and the houses behind us. Then to add insult to injury, centerpoint sends me an email saying power had been restored to my home. Absolutely absurd."
"77571 - Still no power, but I did have my first cup of coffee since Sunday. Which turned into me drinking the whole pot fuck you caffeine withdrawal headaches."
77030 with no power. Told from apartment complex to not expect power for multiple more days.
"Another contribution to “the map is wrong” —

Checked the map just now and still has my address as blue/assessment complete. I have had power since Tuesday afternoon… my neighbors who have had power since Monday afternoon also are showing as blue. 

Also saw about 5-6 contracted centerpoint trucks posted up at the Target off Westheimer and 99 (Katy) this morning around 8:30AM."
"77077 - Briargreen Village - still no power for days. According to the new map, neighbors east of Briargreen drive are partially energized while my side remains in the blue. 


This is truly absurd. I remember losing power to Ike and winter storm Uri but those didn't last long; I never lost power to Harvey, Nicholas, or even the May derecho. Being in a hot, humid and dark house this many days is not fun whatsoever. 


I'm also sick and tired of the noises coming from the compressors my neighbors have been running 24/7. I can't even step outside for some fresh air or open my doors without getting slammed by their pollution. I'll be so happy when the power's back."
77063 I think I have officially lost hope. I really can’t believe a category 1 shut the city down for this long. 
If you are looking for a hotel room I managed to book one in college station that’s pet friendly. If anyone has updates about 77077 please let me know
77092 power is finally back but it's storming so I'm nervous (we're having momentary flickers) to get too excited 😭🙌🏽 I've felt hopeful seeing so many linemen in the area around the Clifton Middle School area since around 9am so I'm praying everyone in the area can get their power back asap!! 
"77571 - Walked down to verify second hand information about crews in the area. Confirmed 2 bucket trucks and guys actively working.

Centerpoint map shows only assessment done, not work. It seems the heroes on the ground maybe working faster than that busted map."
77064 jones and west. No power. Tired of this shit
77042 power is back!
77090 Cypress Station area is back as of about 10ish minutes ago
"77077 near Hwy 6 and Memorial. Came back on in the last few hours while a section 6 doors down never lost power. We were in the same “assessment complete” section as a bunch of lights on Hwy 6 so I was hoping for a quicker response, alas. And no updates from Centerpoint despite already being enrolled in their alerts prior to this storm. Off to shop for a guillotine for their executives, or maybe just a standby home generator. Gonna try to get quotes from several vendors and hopefully not get gouged too bad."
"Map is green, but still no power since Mon 5:45 AM."
"77074 next to Jane Long high, we still have no power, but the map shows the whole area as energized. We don't even have an update from CenterPoint, almost as if they don't give a fuck."
"77027, near Central Market. There has been no power since the storm hit. There is no estimated date for when they will repair the issues. At the very least, let us know how long it will take to get the power back on so we can prepare accordingly.  Centerpoint Energy is a disgrace of a company. I don't expect them to take any blame (though they should), but they need to communicate!!!"
"77025 : finally after 122 hours, we have the power."
77090 .. Finally electricity is back ..
Just checked the map after we got off the phone with center point. My area won't have power again until the 17th and judging by how accurate the map is so far that's if we are lucky. This is just ridiculous I have things due that have already been pushed back.
[deleted]
"77028… showing no eta on the map and everywhere around the neighborhood where rosewood park is has power. Who decided I’m last? Thank you for making me spend so much money and suffer for, according to their map, will be over 14 days? Come on…."
"77004, near Dennis and chenevert, no power still in this nested outage. Centerpoint map said would be fixed Friday, then yesterday, then today. Called them earlier and they said tomorrow. Idk how much longer this is really gonna go"
77007 w 6th got power!
77024 We got ours today!!! so happy!! pray of those that do not have theirs!
"I almost forgot to give an update, my apartment complex on Ella 77090 has power back on finally"
77004 power just came back. Hopefully stays on.
Why have two pinned threads for this?
"Can we not just have 1 megathread for power updates? Whatever the purpose of the other thread is, it all just devolves into power updates lmao"
"I've come to terms that for at least ~50% of us, we're in this for the long haul. The uncertainty in the forecast track and intensity lulled Centerpoint into complacency to not have staged out of state teams. It's going to be a week or more to restore power for that other 50% of us. 

Anyone who works in a hospital or government is saying the same thing about their contingency operations. Nobody wants to interrupt business until it's too late, or be called a fear monger for raising the alarm over a little tropical storm in the Gulf that, for awhile, seemed like it was tracking well south of us."
"77090 and 77073, still no power, just got a lovely text from centerpoint stating:


Blahblahblah we are working hard
Blahblahblah we care
Blahblahblah we are the champions
Oh, and prepare to be without power for days. 
Cheers"
"Got power about an hour ago on Lawrence between 8th and 11th Street in the Heights.  I have to say that given we went through a hurricane, getting power back after only one hot night is not too bad."
"I feel that it is ridiculous how Centerpoint hasn't improved with how they deal with this kind of crisis. 
I know me personally. This is at least the 3rd time I've experienced this exact situation. 
Rita, Ike, now Beryl. 
I'm pretty sure there's another hurricane I'm forgetting the name of where power was out for at least 2 days. 
The freeze we lost power for 3, maybe 4 days. 

What I'm saying is after 2 situations like this I would think Centerpoint could have learned from those 2 incidents and improved the way to handle it. Leaving the system they are taking responsibility for down for so long is not acceptable in my opinion.
If they are taking responsibility for this whole state why wouldn't they stay prepared and equipped to have it repaired after its taken down without the people who pay to use it having to go without for more than a day. 

If this is just impossible due to the way the system or grid is designed, then we need to design a better grid system period.

As a society, we like to think that we are more advanced than we where 10 years back. We aren't if this happened 10 years ago, and we are in that same predicament again. 

As a country, we send billions to other countries so they can do whatever it is they do with it.
 Why can't we use it to design a grid system that can be replaced within a day if the whole thing is taken out?
 If that's beyond the capability of out tech then it's time we take the smartest people we have in that area of study and find a design that doesn't ever let a category 1 hurricane cripple us like this again."
"77090 has a lot of people in sick, elderly in DIRE need.  No traffic lights. Shame on you, Centerpoint!"
Have they done anything at all? This is so fucking ridiculous. It is way too hot for them to be playing around and not giving us updates by location so we can plan.
[deleted]
I just want to say I truly feel bad for all yall still without power. this is insane
"Centerpoint isn’t giving any particular neighborhood by neighborhood updates but they’ve restored about 200,000 customers of 2.5 million at last check. Neighborhoods to the south are seemingly being restored the quickest given the storm impacted and moved out of those areas earlier in the day for their crews to get started."
"My parents and I both live in 77096, in the same apartment complex. They have power and I don't."
"The transmission-line insider guy added another update to his comment, tonight: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/lcik1fn/

> UPDATE3: 2140 on 7/10:

> * lines from Addicks to WP/BW8 to Bellaire returned to service

> * major breaker in south Pasadena returned to service

> * the crosstown work may have hit snags with the middle section that traverses the Heights still scheduled for outage ending 7/10 2200 so that work is likely to be moved to tomorrow. This includes a major xfmr at 610/290 that is scheduled to come back 7/13 1700

>Points to remember:

> * major lines feed the smaller lines. This is all information about major lines, not the lines that go to your house or even feed your neighborhood. These are big big lines that are the backbone of the system.

> * lines going out of service is normal, particularly when things need to be de-energized to fix them. Most of the time de-energizations happen and you never even know it because other lines handle the change but right now it's very possible to gain power and then lose it again. I know that it incredibly frustrating, but it's really the only way.

> * most work is likely moving to the distribution network where visibility drops. Currently it looks like they plan to wrap up major work by end of Saturday although that may easily move.

> * likely outages will be updated and new plans come out overnight from the work this evening."
Let’s go riot. I see no other option.
I lost power in 77034 and nothing yet.  Some down power lines
77044 just turned back on.
77008. Down since 6:30am. No sign of Centerpoint at all out here.
"77477 , still no power, though some buildings in my complex did get power back."
77477 whole neighborhood is pitch black. Except for all the neighbors chilling in their cars on driveways just to charge their phones lol (myself included)
"77016 Scenic Woods. Lost power 9:15am. Not a flicker since. Took a drive through the area around sunset. The Mi Tienda on 59 and Little York was open and packed. Everything else, except for a packed Valero on Little York was closed. Fiesta looked like they had power, and so did Home Depot (I know they have generators), but they were both closed. Only other stuff I saw with any real power was some light industry that surely has their own generators."
"77063 Tanglewilde/Ella Lee ln no power still. Neighbors on Guessner, Briar Forest dr and Westerland Dr got power. Centre point website says our meter is powered and online, not sure if they know that it's really NOT bc they don't accept electricity related calls today 😞"
77546 lost power at 5:00 a.m. four houses away from me got their power back at 5:00 p.m. not me though.
"Pessimistic news for those in 77024. Don’t expect power till at best tomorrow. According to email from piney point mayor, centerpoint has just assessed the damage today and work will begin tomorrow."
"77057, 77494, and 77035 all out since this morning and still nothing."
77023. No power since 8/9am.
Is there a way to sign up for center point energy text updates without using the website ? I can’t get the page to load
77034.  No power.   If this post goes through than cell towers might be working.
77459 still no power since 6am Monday :(
77011 just woke up after 'sleeping' partial power no water
77573 not necessarily in Houston I’m in league city but TNMP outage map says they are re evaluating for about 12+ hours and Main Street has power we are a block away and we don’t what gives
77406 (Pecan Grove) - No power still been out since Monday at 5:30 am.
I live right off I10 and gessnar. Every Business around me has power but my complex. Even after the last storm they lost it. This one nope just my complex. This is bullshit
"77019, 4th ward. Townhouses across the street from mine never lost power. Apartment complex I can see from my home (on grey) has power, I can see tvs. But nothing for the block I'm on apparently.


Gonna have to go somewhere with the animals today, can't stay when it's gonna hit the 90s. :-( even my parents out in bfe are without. "

"77070 and 77379, no power for 24 hours now"
77054 still no power
Has anyone else got pussy footed? It’s happened twice so far the lights turned on then instantly turned off. Wtf does that mean? Both times happened 12 hours between eachother and the most recent one was 5 hours ago.
"77006 (near Montrose) power now on - thanks to the power crew working overtime

There are many trees down in area despite storm being ""only a Cat 1"". It's going to be a process to get them cleared from utility right of ways"
77004 museum district - Got power back at about 1030am. Across the street had power last night.
77076 still no power
"77536, lots of places with power now.

I have the dubious joy of having had the pole transformer blow about 30 minutes before the neighborhood, so many streets now have power - - except 4 of us.

I suspect that I'm gonna be waiting a few days."
"We’re out. And been out since Monday morning at 3AM. 77354 here and no where in sight has power. I drive to Conroe every day for work and even there they’re out of power. I got a child, dementia grandfather and wife at home with no food or running water"
77009 by north main. Power back on.
"Is anybody receiving power alerts from CenterPoint? I normally get them, but this time I am getting nothing. Half of our apartment complex has power, but my half doesn't. When I log in it says ""Status: Power Off"", but I've not received any emails or texts acknowledging our outage, despite being signed up for alerts."
Any update on 77070 (249/cypresswood dr area)? Haven’t seen any centerpoint trucks.
"My Mom in 77065 has power, but my brother in 77064 does not. I'm in 77069 still without power."
77019 power up 45 and Dallas
"Does this message from CenterPoint mean anything?

Repair crews are assessing the power issue at or near 77005. We will update you with additional information about the status of these repairs as it becomes available. We appreciate your patience as we work to complete our repairs as quickly and safely as possible."
"77004, around Binz and Calumet - Power came back around 5:30PM. Hopefully it keeps, I was starting to get a little loopy."

"77081 Marquis on Pin Oak back up!!
First year Houstonian….that fuckin sucked"
Any update as of 77070?
"A lot of Westbury got power about an hour ago, but as other reported Comcast dropped soon after. Whatever, my house was 80F and 72% humidity, I will take even a couple hours of power to get the humidity down."
"77070 still no power and i think were gonna be last like always 😞 its so hot and i have alot of elderly neighbors, this is horrible!! "
77035 wya i need power soon im bouta go insane

[deleted]
"77006 no power Missouri street says green on centerpoint, have reported the outage online multiple times."
"Can you add the link to the new outage map by CenterPoint? Thanks  
[https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195bcf03ae0c491f9f14bf77f2c43420](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195bcf03ae0c491f9f14bf77f2c43420)"
Half my street has power but the other half me included doesn’t  they come by yesterday and didn’t fix it they never came back:/
"77095 Southcreek still no power, out since 4 AM Monday.  Down the street they have lights but I'm part of a big long stretch that doesn't. I hope, hope, hope we are on the list for today. 🤞🤞🤞"
"I’ve posted a few times about my area here (77004, Venue Museum District apartments at Fannin and Oakdale). But we got power back around 10:30 pm last night, and the map still showed our address in orange as of this morning. My Centerpoint account DID update, however, to show that my meter was on once it was restored."
77530 just got power back
77095 Copper Lakes power just came back!!!
"77054, no power since Monday am. Every single other house in my neighborhood has power. Can someone explain how this is possible? Is my house somehow the only one connected to a different power line?"
77045 neighbors across the street got their power back. We never lost our power (we did last time) and the ATT internets still out
[deleted]
"77006 - kipling and dunlavy, just got it back"
"Anyone know the status of 77008, near TC Jester and 11th? It sounds like power around the area is starting to come back. Currently working at a friend's house in Rosenberg and have not had a chance to go out to check."
77006 by comm and Vermont back in biz
77057 San Felipe/Fountain View area. We have power.  Centerpoint outage map is inaccurate

"77007 - neighborhood near Jackson Hill & Washington still no power, but it looks like everyone around us has power 🫠"
"77066 - Thursday 7:17 AM - No power at our house, nearby businesses and traffic lights.  

I did see three utility bucket trucks northbound on Hollister heading toward 1960, and those were the first I've seen in this area.  Have to see that as a good sign."
77373 still nothing. Still haven’t seen a truck. No poles/lines down or trees down in the general area. My new hobby is sitting in the gas station parking lot and watching people not understand how to do a 4 way stop.
They meant noon Pacific Team obviously
"Frustrated with the lack of info for my area (and in general). If we don’t have an estimated restoration date yet, is it safe to assume we won’t have power by the end of the weekend?

Info would be helpful in figuring out next steps, but when has centerpoint done anything helpful?"
Still no estimate for the Gessner and Kemp Forest area... or much of Spring Branch at all.
"77096, the neighborhood behind Parker elementary has power (Willowbend and Atwell). Centerpoint is still reporting my power as off but a a neighbor said it was off and on for an hour, but now staying on. Will be driving over in a few to confirm if I can go home 🤞🏾🙏🏾"
77498 west Bellfort and hw6 is back
77407 Aliana has power again
77063 westheimer/south gessner still nothing. Shows green on the map but no power. Staying positive 🤘🏼
Waste management and disposal service skipped twice this week. Garbage bags are accumulating on the sidewalk. The situation is getting worse.
I would love to here more news about 77077. Ran from our apartment to a family friend that has power but you can only stay so long without feeling like intruding. My mom is at the end of her rope at the thought of this outage lasting any longer.
77003 is still without power 
77003 sampson street has power as of 7 pm
77354 just got power back. Here’s hoping its for good 🤞🏻

The entire fucking map of 77006 just inverted from blue to light green and vice-versa. Wtf is this?
"77459 Mo City. Cartwright west of Meadowcreek is still dark all the way past the 1092 intersection. Meadowcreek and eastward towards the texas parkway seems to have power.

The Chevron at Cartwright and Quail Valley East Drive is open and has gas if anyone in the area is still looking.

Stay safe yall."
77379 - power's back on!! :')

"77379, JUST got power back off louetta."
"My section of 77066 went from end of day July 13 to end of day July 14 and I'm so tired, and scared of it just being continously pushed back."
"Still no power In my block. 77029 One side of the neighbors have power and the other side (includes me) none. Last time I check it was blue, then back to green which means energized. Ugh not even an estimate day on restoration.

 Update: my power came back. I”ll pray to all father that power gets back to all other parts of Houston today as well. "
77090 power back on finally 😩
"77004, midtown, Dennis and chenevert, still no power. According to the dumb map we should’ve had it fixed EOD yesterday but it seems like there’s still nested outages. No ETA as of right now"
"77057 Bering/San Felipe

No power since 4am Monday, neighbors were turned back on after 48hrs. My place has been all of the colors on the map lol

Woke up to a text from Xfinity saying we were restored this morning. Must have been a flicker because we got nothing. Pain 🤠"
"new map. july 16 for me. 


at least there’s a date now."
"77034 - Gulf Palms - Power back up at around 14:50 local time (2pm, almost 3pm)

I know many brothers and sisters in this thread and the other main daily are still out, but thankfully this time. I am done for now."
Why it’s about to storm..AGAIN?!?!
77096. power just flickered twice. praying its them working on the wires and we will get power back tonight. 😖
[deleted]
IT'S BACK 77389 IT'S BAAAAACK
77373 Bradbury Forest is back up!
"77057 Woodway and Voss we are BACK ONLINE! I could not be more relieved, finally!!"
77040 off west gulf bank road has power! 🎉🙏🏾
"77023 no power. I think that the last folks to get their power restored should have a block party style celebration with news coverage, a marching band and prizes from local businesses. lol."
"77066 - Monday 7/15 - Still out, and the map says by end of day Wednesday, still.

I think a big part of the problem, right in the middle of the purple section on our map, is [this pole that's down](https://i.imgur.com/Nj67JQP.jpg) near the Tim Horton's at Richie and Bammel N. Houston.

I have to go to work today and leave the house on generator power, but sure hope someone sees them starting to do some work on this pole today.  It's not a simple one because there are underground conduit runs involved, but it'll obviously have to be fixed before a lot of us get power back."
77373 Cypresswood near Kroger. Monday day 8 out of power.
"77066 - Champions Village II - Power restored just before 3:30 this afternoon (Monday).

Delighted to be able to shut off that generator and give it a rest."
77055 - Hammerly and Johanna just got power back!
"77008 N of 24th - POWER BACK ON 2:50 PM

Spoke to the linemen - when they tried to re-energize the circuit yesterday, the inrush amperage from everyone's AC kicking on at the same time melted one of the power lines into another, causing a short and blowing a big fuse (the grenade we heard over here).

They replaced the lines and the fuse, and we should be stable!"
"77004 Museum District just LOST power again.
Edit: Update, power is back. They had to turn it off in order to repair a local power line apparently."
"77095, still no power in my area. Sleeping downstairs on the couch, but my 80lb dog decided it’s a good idea to sleep on my legs tonight 🙃"
"So um about that tracker...
Is it in the room with us along with the power?"
"I hope as long as its taking they truly are FIXING the problem, not putting tape over it."
"Still no power in my Alief neighborhood. Two million people without power, is that some kind of record? And for this weak ass storm?


 For the first time, a couple of my neighbors seem to have acquired generators. While I'm proud of them for staying on top of things, I didn't realize how incredibly loud they are. Can't imagine what it will sound like after everyone gets one we will inevitably need to do."
77004. Got power back at 1 pm.
"77025 power is back for me. I can take in anyone’s dog or small animal tomorrow who needs it (I have pet rats so I can’t take any cats, I’m sorry).

Thank you, linemen. CenterPoint and Texas reps: eat shit!"
Centerpoint just sent a text saying they are working on clearing debris and vegetation to make repairs. They are saying to be prepared to not have power for several days. Thing is...there is no damaged lines or debris/vegetation around 77040 for miles!
"77498 still no power, I’m pregnant and this heat is…not comfortable. 

Our neighborhood has been on “Assessment in progress” on Centerpoint’s bullshit map since it was released. Just now my husband and I spotted a lineman truck in our neighborhood, so we chased it down and asked if they were fixing things in our neighborhood. Nope - they were just now doing the initial patrol of our area to spot/identify issues. Then they’d have to go report back to their superiors, who presumably would take the info and put us in line for some assistance sometime in the future. The linemen in the truck had no idea when they or anyone would be sent out to actually do any repairs. 

The best part is I checked the status map right after that conversation and the fucking liars at Centerpoint (not blaming the linemen at all) had updated our area to “assessment complete.” They barely STARTED this morning and said the patrol of their assigned area might take a day or two. Centerpoint is absolutely cooking the books to make it seem like they have done way more than they have and repairs are progressing much faster than they actually are. 

This shit makes me so angry and there’s nothing, absolutely nothing we can do about it as long as our corrupt and complicit state government (who I already vote against in every election) co-signs this abysmal treatment of their citizens."
77007 Jackson Hill & Feagan has power!!
77091-(Pinemont Plaza-near Tidwell and TCJ) power restored. It was off from 5am Monday to 5pm Friday. Thank you Linemen and fuck you Centerpoint!
Map is green but no power since Monday 7 am. We have no status because they don’t give a shit about the 5 houses on my street with no power
[deleted]
77025. Out since 5 am still.
77007 next to St Thomas High School and still no power.  It took 3 days to get power to this area during the derecho.  I feel like the damage from the hurricane was not as extensive so hoping we get it back sooner.
"We have a downed line. I'm trying to call an EMERGENCY, but I can't get through!!!"
"77062, no power still, my poor pets started overheating so we sat in my car for ac :("
"SOS I’m new to generators — how do I safely power down my generator? I know unplug everything but should I kill the gas switch first and let it shut down or flip the off switch? 

I have the 3500w craftman from Lowe’s."
77007 near Cleveland Park still no power.
Still no power or water in 77027 since early this morning 😵‍💫

77586 is still pretty fucked.
"77030, just north of Holcombe, power just came back on."

Does anyone in 77008 have power?  Don’t even see crews out
Has anyone gotten power back and then lost it again? Trying to figure out how stable this state of restoration is!
77006 back on
My center point account just changed from power off to power on but I clearly don’t have power — what does that mean? Working its way?

Anyone in spring got power back ?
77063 just got power.
Power restored for 77004. Commented previously—located near MacGregor/TSU/St. Mary’s Catholic Church.
"77494 just came back online as did 77035 and 77057 earlier.  All partial obviously. 

Also, if you haven't got a poweralert notification about your house yet, don't be discouraged. I only got prior notice they were working on one of them. The other two just came on without notice."
77095 power on. Thank you Jesus
77007 between Shepherd and TC Jester just got power back! Was about to head to my wife's office and it blessedly returned.
77459 still nothing :((
Center point told someone in our complex to expect several days... At 77021
77072 the entire shopping center where the HEB is at Beltway 8 and Beechnut is has power. The Whataburger drive thru only is open. The Boba and Wok Express are open. But still no power past that on Beechnut to (?) although I believe someone said there is power further down around Kirkwood or Dairy Ashford iirc
"77098 Montrose - power came back on around 4 or 5 PM I think. 

I was staying with a friend in Katy and made the mistake of waiting to get gas. Don't wait. I had to go to four gas stations to get gas and my empty light was on. One station ran out right as I pulled up to the pump. I finally got gas at the Kroger on Voss.

Edit: some hotels are still available in Katy and my coworkers were able to get hotel rooms near the galleria"
77008 Beverly and 13th whole neighborhood is out 😔 
"There's a pole down at Bammel North Houston and Richey that's been down since Monday evening, I haven't seen one truck around it."
77373 still no power…this is ridiculous
"
No power yet 77077 near 6 and Westheimer

Update 7p still nope

Update Thurs just after midnight still nope"
Does anyone know a timeline of the different steps centerpoint takes? As in when they will start on the neighborhood level outages and so on
Just came back to power in my apartment building again 😭 they also removed the fallen tree in the front  (77019 - across from Piggy’s bar) hope that means other buildings on my block also got power back! 
"Just stopped by 77096 about 30 minutes ago. Didn’t see any homes with visible lights driving down Hillcroft from US 90. The whole neighborhood between Willowbend/Hillcroft and W Bellfort/Chimney Rock seemed to be out. While leaving, I saw some traffic lights that were dead last night back on again, on/near Chimney Rock and US 90. Don’t know if that means anything."
"77584 had power for a few flickers then cut out again. Email from Centerpoint saying the issue is resolved and thanks for being a customer lol. No power to anything on my block, went ahead and rereported it I guess."
"77070 - NW cypresswood area, fm1960- finally got power here, we saw many trucks now going down 1960, good luck neighbors"
77015 Email from Centerpoint just now saying they are working on getting me an estimate of which date my power will be restored

77009 Houston Ave near Bayland is on
"77587. Just got power back. Thanks to the boys from Besco out of Chattanooga, TN for getting us back online."
"> work on a major crosstown 138kV line through the Heights to Crosby is going out this evening (1630) and expected back at 2200. This is likely to go out or may already be out, hopefully come back later tonight.

This is from the Ercot guy from earlier. I live between the Heights and Crosby in the Sheldon area, could someone smarter than me tell me what this means for power between the two places? My power never came back aside from a brief 5 minute period yesterday, could this possibly mean that we'll get ours back tonight?"
77379 and 77070 still nothing. Losing hope
Anyone know about what's going on in magnolia (77354)? Still no power since 5am Monday but there's a bunch of Centerpoint trucks out here off of Egypt. Trying to see if we should have any hope lol

Temp slowly dropping from a peak of 81 in the apt. We don't get direct sunlight and on 1st floor. Ngl feel rly grateful for that and hope the linemen get most of yall back online tonight. 


Oh and bummer.. my xfinity router appears to have been fried. Anyone else have that happen?? It won't power on at all. "
[deleted]
"Does it show ""Power is on"" under yalls Centerpoint account as soon as the power is back at your house?"
77019 - La Rue street near W. Dallas & Waugh. Still no power. We have been a highlighted blue section of the map for the past 24 hours or so but still nothing. a neighbor told me we won’t get restored until SUNDAY?! Not sure how well informed they are. I pray they are wrong as hell tho 
77057 near San Felipe/Fountain View power just came back on 😭
"77571 - No power, but the antique bike path lights have power so that's good. Bicycle safety is no joke."
"[https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/about-us/news/1779](https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/about-us/news/1779)

  
Does anyone have access to the most recent update from the centerpoint site where they report the number of outages/restored? When I went to open the one they released at 8am today, it keeps opening to a blank page...."
77069- left two hours ago and there was still no power for those wondering.
77494 Seven Meadows section 19 (northeast of Fry/Katy-Gaston) got power back at 1 a.m. Xfinity appears to be working as well. Im not sure if the whole neighborhood is back up though.
77040 still a wasteland of no power
Power still out 77096. Any update?
"CNP map now has dates - for my neighborhood in 77345 (Kingwood), I have “end of day, July 12”. Yay, tomorrow! Could be BS but I’m hopeful!"
How are you guys checking estimates? Any updates on 77459 Missouri City?
77063 showing green on the map as of late but unfortunately we don’t have power here. I’m sure this nasty storm will cause delay. I bet CenterPoint didn’t know a storm was coming today 😅🙄😩
"I guess this storm is gonna cause some further delays, understandably. 
Saw that there is no ETA for my area, at this rate I hope it’s before Sunday"
77450- AT&T internet back on as of 2PM
"77571 - Letter from mayor says power by weekend longshot most likely mid week.

The truck stop and all the businesses across the highway from me are powered."
Does anyone have an update on 77373? North Spring?
"77379 - 99 and champion forest drive area… power appears to be back up.

Not at location, but all my devices just popped up online and got notifications on my phone."
77070 near millridge still no power 😭 it’s going to be 4th day if it’s not back on tonight! I just can’t anymore 😩
"Still no power in my area. 77088 next to 249, trying to see when I might get power back but the site just says the assessment is completed"
77044 bw8/tidwell We just got power back on
"77586 - most of Seabrook/El Lago is up except for my little strip.  The rest of the circuit started coming online about 40 minutes ago, so I'm hopeful they're just powering up in stages and we are due tonight."
77407 got power back 24 hours ago. Lost it again just now.
77070 Cypresswood and Cutten. Feeling like I’m one of those post-Sunday people from what I’ve heard.
77089 - Just got power 🙏🏼
77479 - avalon ; power up ! 
I really should have evacuated katy. Near la centerra and still no power. So behind on work and at my wits end.
"Stopped by my dad's house in 77088, near Antoine and Gulf Bank. He got power as soon as we got there. Around 5:30PM ish"
[deleted]
"77064 - Between 1960 and Beltway 8. Brother’s House got power back at 7. Power briefly went back out, but has remained on since 8 pm."
[deleted]
"Still in our non-electrified bubble in 77006. Tried calling Centerpoint and they are at least aware of the outage. No estimate of course. 

I was in New Orleans as a teenager when Katrina hit. I never thought I’d have to relive a mini version of that in Houston and from a Cat 1."
Has anyone in the partially energized zone gotten an ETA? I only see blue areas with ETAs and I’m wondering if they’ll do us last.
[deleted]
77098- actually losing hope
"77379 - Got back power yesterday around 5PM, lost power around 11:30 am until 12:30 pm today - now have power + internet. Considering my blessings."
updated map and still in blue with no estimate.
77055 - Power back Janak and Wirt

"77459 - Just got it back an hour ago, unsure if it’s my Xfinity router or the coaxial outlet, but the router isn’t turning on at all to even indicate no internet with the orange light."
Saw 3 CP trucks on San Jacinto and Cleburne
77077 - briar forest & Kirkwood - got power back about an hour ago
"77571 - Bucket trucks all took off at 6pm. Another night tending the generator. But that's ok, I am grateful for having it."
77007 mid-Jackson Hill. Power is back up as of a few hours ago!
Do they actually work overnight as well? Anybody got power back in the middle of the night? The new map is absolute trash. Marked as energized when the whole neighborhood is still without power.
"77090 says i should have had power yesterday.. still no power in my apts or any businesses or lights on my street for that matter, stop fwm centerpoint just be honest about when my shits coming back on i have roaches trying to move in its so muggy in my apt."
77008 near TC Jester. Still no power but I saw a ton of bucket trucks out by Eureka rail yard this morning. So maybe there’s hope
77571- We back baby! Fingers crossed it stays that way!
My generator just went out for good like 30 minutes ago. I am screwed at this point. No sign of trucks anywhere.
"77388 FM 2920/Bridgestone Ln

Power came on for 2 seconds and hasn't come back since."
[deleted]
"77379, Spring Cypress/Champions forest, we just got power back. Out since Monday morning, even though we’ve been listed as energized since two days ago."
"77006, Fairview & Waugh. Finally got an estimate for restoration. EOD next Tuesday. 

I’m fucking floored it’s taking this long. But at least we got news?"
77008 near 11th and TC Jester - power is back
13th street lit up!!! 😊 ⛮ 🚦 
Finally after long days our power is up! Mist ln apartment 77070 😊 thank you lord! 🙏
finally. 77489 is back. bless you all who are still putting up with centerpointless’ bullshit. hoping you all get it soon
77380 no power but restoration map says today. Have 0 faith in that tho
"The map said my area by 288/dennis/McGowen was suppose to be fixed Friday, then yesterday, and today there is still no power. 

I really want this shit to end"
"77066 - Champions Point Village - Hollister/Bourgeois - Day 7 without power.  Also, Xfinity cable has been out the whole time too.

Logging into their website and phone app, it shows weather-related outage, but it sure seems like they should be up by now."
"77066 - W. Richey/Bammel N. Houston - Sunday 7/14 1:40 PM - [Here's part of the problem.](https://i.imgur.com/Nj67JQP.jpg)

Pole down since the storm, looks relatively straightforward.  No trees, very accessible.  

Feeds buried lines, probably for several subdivisions and intersections.  Lights still out at that intersection and most nearby."
Two of my relatives in 77088 have power now
77007 near Yale and 6th got power at about 2:20pm today. Centerpoint account still incorrectly says power is off.
"77386, Spring - Back of Imperial Oaks (a bunch of streets called “Estates”). Power Restored as of 5 minutes ago. Giving it a bit to see if it’ll go off again, but we’re very happy!"
My internet was somehow restored before my power 😅
Still no power in Kingwood
"Power was projected to be back on for my area on 16Jul2024, however, power was restored last evening on 14Jul2024. Centerpoint’s power outage map still shows my area as pending to have power restored by 16Jul2024. The power outage map cannot be relied on completely. 

To all those that remain without power, my thoughts are with you, and hopefully you are restored soon and before your projected restoration date"
77086 - 249 & Beltway 8 Power restored at 11:30.

"seems like we have a bad transformer,  just my godamn luck.  it only feeds a couple of houses so how fucked are my neighbors and I?"

Entergy Texas Hurricane Beryl Alert

Tuesday, July 16, 2024 – 9:30 a.m.

TEXAS

Nearly all customers restored after Hurricane Beryl caused widespread outages across Southeast Texas 

As of 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, approximately 248,000 of the 252,460 customers have been restored. The remaining customers who can safely take power are expected to be restored today.

Customers still experiencing an outage are encouraged to safely check for damage to the electrical equipment attached to their home or business. Entergy Texas cannot restore power to a location with a damaged meter base, conduit or weather head (the metal pipe extending upward from the structure with electrical cables inside). These items must be repaired by a qualified electrician before workers can start the restoration process. Entergy’s Storm Center provides a list of the electrical equipment the company will repair, and the equipment customers are responsible for repairing.  https://www.entergynewsroom.com/storm-center/weatherhead/

As crews continue to clear debris and restore power in hard-hit areas, customers are encouraged to visit Entergy’s View Outage map or sign up for outage alerts to receive real-time restoration updates. Entergy Texas will continue working around the clock until every customer impacted by Hurricane Beryl is restored."
1:30p Power back on in 77092 - Watonga and 43rd. 15 days out this year.
My mom in Humble 77396 just had electricity turn on minutes ago! Happened just a few hours after internet came back on.
I'm in 77057. Power out since Fri night. just turned back on. Fountain View.
"I mainly dislike the lies. I was given two different repair times. Then I was told it had been fixed. It had not. Confirmed with neighbors. I had to call it in again. Now they admit it hasn't been fixed. Duh.

I can handle adversity, but don't piss on me and tell me that it's raining, Centerpoint!"
Does Centerpoint work overnight or are we cooked for another day? Fuck this is demoralizing.
77584 power back on as of 20 minutes ago!
"77007 tc jester east and I10, no power since about 8am, there are a few streets in the zipcode that got their power but nothing for us. "
"77090 and 77073 still no power. 
If their latest ""map"" is to be trusted it's all ""assessment"" and no actual repair work has even started. Still haven't seen a single linesman or repair crew or even truck. 


At this point I'm treating everything Centerpoint says as lies, incompetence and PR BS. Very very angry, I hope they get what's due for being unprepared and ignoring issues.


State, City, county officials are all now playing the blaming game. Beyond pathetic. 
Nice start to a mayor's term /s"
"So the new map says that my entire area is totally energized, yet I'm looking out on a totally dark neighborhood. It's scheduled to be done by the end of today, so I think what they're doing is just putting anything that's scheduled to be done today as already done to pump their numbers up and make it look better."
"77066 (Klein) 11:00pm


Most of the surrounding area is lit back up, but there is an island of darkness around Bammel N Houston and Richey. I am in that darkness. It's like repair crews came and repaired everything else but my complex and the small subdivision behind it. Still have yet to see any trucks even look at the fallen utility pole at the corner of the intersection. They even got much of Greenwood Forest back online and there were trees down left and right in that area! Makes no sense. 


Other than that cell service is working as it should. 


More stores are open on 1960 and Veterans Memorial so don't have to go far and relives congestion when going out for supplies.

77088 still has no power
77089 Dixie farm and Blackhawk… still no power received a text at midnight that they would have a better timeline by “tomorrow” great way to create confusion because did they mean “today” or actually “tomorrow”. At the 71 hour mark without power.

"77014 Update: no updates, still no power :))))"

I saw a guy with a tablet doing a survey this morning and the map from centrepoint has been now updated to blue for most of Houston. I don't think there is anyone, though, actually fixing anything on the ground in this area. Another one of their assessments? Does anyone have any updates?"

"77008, Sunset Heights: No power. Was out 76 hours during the freeze and 136 hours after the derecho, so I'm just assuming our neighborhood will be one of the last again."
77429 Huffmeister & Telge. Just got power back although some people in my small area don’t have it. Map says we wouldn’t get it back til the 12th.
Has anyone that has been in the light green gotten power? We are one of a few houses in our neighborhood without power and wondering if there’s any chance we will get it back sooner rather than later
Power restoration on my street is garbage. Half of the other side of my street got power a day ago. The other half of the street got power at 1PM today. The whole row on my side still has no power. ALL of the center point trucks left the area. So I'm about to get gas to try and run my generator another night.....
Are there any updates for 77060? The map hasn’t updated for that area at all and all around us seems to have power. I feel so ignored :(
77077 Energy Corridor - My modem on AT&T Smart home manager app is showing my modem back online again but I’m 2 hours away from home. Anybody in this area got power back?

My brother in 77064 just got power.

Editing to add: in case it wasn’t obvious, still don’t have power haha"
77063 still down 🥲

No power yet 77030 Cambridge and Holcombe intersection. Map doesn’t indicate estimated time. So tired.
77502 some blocks have power some don't. Mine seems sandwiched between two that do so I don't really understand how this is working tbh
77018 villas near stomping grounds - still no power
"77089, Sagemeadow along Blackhawk. After getting power for like 30 seconds last night, nothing else happened. Now on the outage map, it says expected power by the end of today, and I saw multiple electric trucks in my neighborhood, including one working on lines at the end of my street. I'm praying it'll actually be fixed today"
"77072 no power since Monday and it is Friday. All hope is lost. Been sleeping in heat, no good food, barely able to charge my phone. I'm already tired."
77088- Day 5 no power still. The outage map showed our area green with power restored but that’s not true. No one has power except some businesses.
Just got power back yesterday (77096) and this rain and thunder has my anxiety so high.
"77004- transformer blew Tuesday night…still without power. Management won’t help us and we’ve reported to centerpoint at least 10 times now. 
What the fuck."
77003 Between Webster and McGowan and I finally have power!
77042 near westpark Dr and briar park. Just heard a loud noise that heartbreakingly sounded like a transformer exploding.
77042 Woodchase and Westpark now have power in my complex!!!
77373 by Hirschfield I just got home and my powers back on. 
"77004, midtown, 288/McGowen

No power still. The map shows that my part is connected to the portion across 288 and is light green. The other portion right next to me is blue. Idk what that means in reality but I hope this gets fixed by the end of the weekend. 

I think we’re gonna cave and go stay at a friend’s house for the weekend."
77586 - my little block is the last holdout east of 146 in Seabrook.  Line crew said they have a few more spots my way left to hit tonight.  Fingers crossed.  I got a hotel room today so I figured once I spent the money we would see progress.
"77070, just north of Louetta/249 intersection. Just got confirmation that our power is back from our apartment office. Hope more of you in the same area also have good news soon!"
"Just got power back in 77583, five minutes after I finished changing the oil in my generator."
"77388 FM 2920/Bridgestone

Out since Monday 6:28am. I give up on ever getting power back."
Anyone that dealt with this in the derecho- will nested power outages be addressed after all of the circuits are complete…. After the 19th?
"77379 still no power since Monday early morning , the lines are still down in front of my neighborhood and 0 work has been done."
77459 still no power
"77066 - Hollister south of Bourgeois - Champions Point Village II - 5:42 AM Saturday, no power.  The corner store at Hollister & Bourgeois has power, as do the traffic lights.  

Centerpoint texted last night around 8:45 saying our area's expected restoral time is by end of day Sunday.  

Driving around our neighborhood, no obvious major problems.  Poles & wires are up, no trees across lines, etc.

Must be a hidden issue somewhere.  

Since they also gave that same time frame for my office over off Theall Rd. near Cutten, and it came up Thursday evening, I guess we can see a fair chance they'll get us up today.

I'm glad I have a generator but I should have set up natural gas for it.  Propane is $84 a day and wrestling 100 lb. cylinders isn't a fun way to spend time in the heat."
77069 Champions Green Apartments - Still no power. Map shows no estimated date for restoration. Really losing hope here…
77006 Missouri St. small pocket of houses still without power but the map says we are energized. I’ve reported the outage online several times. Is it worth calling and trying to talk to someone? Has anyone with a “nested” outage in an energized area had any lucky with calling CP?
77379 Spring Cypress road intersecting stubiner power back on.
77586 - Seabrook.  Looks like the final trees and branches are being cleared between Repsdorph and El Lago.  Some branches were on the lines behind Regatta Bay and Bar Harbor.  Hopefully this is it.  Just got the workers some bourbon as a thank you.  Tree crew all the way from West Virginia.
"77388 FM 2920/Bridgestone Ln

Power's back!!!!!!!!!"
"Status website for people living in Bellaire.

[https://www.bellairetx.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=2653](https://www.bellairetx.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=2653)"
huge armada of 8+ trucks has set up camp behind me at the funeral home on heights and 13th. I have power but hopefully this turns more of yall on n of me
77027 near the central market. Just got word my power is back! The estimated date they said was July 17th. So that map is completely useless.
"It's still much less detail than Entergy has been providing, but Centerpoint has finally started posting limited updates for their specific services areas, here: https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/Safety/Pages/Storm-updates.aspx?sa=ho&au=res"
"We were supposed to get power today, but it’s still out. 77056"
"77057 Woodway and Voss- well I’m disappointed honestly. Map says we were supposed to get power today, and the eight trucks outside our complex this afternoon were suggesting that too. Me and my neighbors were super excited by all the activity. And then the trucks moved down the street to do some more work. But now I’m winding down for another night on my sofa with my fan :/"
"77571, still no power on the backside of Shoreacres. Happy to hear that our neighborhood has started to get power again. God bless "
77072 power finally came back 30 minutes ago

Begging for a crumb of power.
Mentally defeated and feeling forgotten."

"77006, trucks spotted down Nevada and Ridgewood. 🙏"
77007 Durham and Floyd. No power and no water. Nothing since Monday morning.
Finally getting some attention near N. Braeswood and Academy. Several Centerpoint bucket trucks. Am in a fairly large nested outage in 77025.  Hopefully they can fix it tonight!
77373 (louetta/lexington) is on! Has been for about 25 minutes. Absolutely wonderful!
"77024- Bunker Hill Village area just got power back!

Received an email today it would be end of day on the 17th."
77035 no power 
"77023, next to Mason Park. Tree from park is still downed over power lines. No linemen seen. They really do not give a fuck.

No power since 8am literally last Monday. No estimate from Centerpoint. Nothing."
"in 77036, we got power back the second night after the storm but it went out again this morning... 😭 did anyone have their power go out again and then restored...?"
"77018 
Just got power turned back on thank goodness it has been rough"
77055 Antoine and Westview - nested outage restored around 2:00pm today
"77004 Jackson and Anita, just got home and after 9 days we finally have power!"
"77066 - Power restored Monday just before 3:30 PM.  But yesterday evening at 6:19 PM the power went off but only stayed off for about 2 minutes.  

Having seen posts from people who got power back, restocked fridges, then had it go back out for hours, I was really glad when that A/C kicked back in.  

Hoping for stability as we move ahead.

I checked the restoral map this morning and was surprised at how many areas still do not have power.

Lots of suffering going on."
"77406, power went off at 5:30ish, not back yet."
77062 powers been out for about 24 hours now.
77095. Have not seen a single Centerpoint truck when I was driving. What are they doing?! This is insanity they are so disorganized. Playing with peoples lives in this heat. They had time to prepare!
[deleted]
77006 Milam and McGowen power back on!
"You late on the huge bills they send you  they would shut off fast ,  your power is out so what. After this storm they most likely lose a lot of costumers, for there lack keeping people informed about power outages   My power is been off going on 3 day nothing from tnmp"
"77040 no power when we left around 7:00 pm. Currently charging stuff at a friend’s in the energy corridor where things seem mostly ok. I am losing my mind, anyone else? :)))) i’m not sure how much more of this i want to go through y’all."
"On CenterPoint's [Outage Tracker](https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/?_ga=2.223443356.64566939.1720578371-221761639.1720444979) page, they posted a link: 

""**July 10, 2024 - 8:30 p.m.**  -    [CenterPoint Energy provides customer restoration update](https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/about-us/news/1778)"". 

When I click on it, as of the time of this comment, all I see is a white page with the words: 

""The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable."" 

At this point the material is writing itself."
"This storm looks gnarly, def gonna delay restoration even more smh"
"77035 - Willowbend

Just got power back 5 min ago!"
Power restored in 77386!
"Anyone know how many people are still without power? I let a friend borrow a window AC and generator for his 87 yr old grandma that lives off Bingle and 290, and now he's not returning my calls. Wondering if he just wants to keep it and I got scammed fml"
"Keep getting told I have power when I don’t have power. I’m 100% sure they are keeping our power off on purpose. I had power for an hour or so the other day and then they shut it off. Line guys saying they were told not to turn the power on our side because they didn’t want to “overload” the system. That has never been an issue in the 5 years I’ve been here, during any outage. What the fuck is going on?"
Has anybody without power actually had it restored? There are vast areas in my neighborhood that are just completely pitch black. I know CenterPoint claims that they restored a million people and they're going to restore a million more by Wednesday where there will still be another million left without power but somehow I don't believe them.
Zip codes don’t mean shit. My in laws have had power since yesterday afternoon meanwhile we haven’t since 6am yesterday…. We live down the street from each other in the same zip code.
77095 no power and now no water. Third world country.
77022. We lost power right at 5am and got it back a tad before 6pm
"Y'all got back fast!! I'm glad to hear that some of y'all have your power back already, hopefully it'll be back within a couple of days. My job is closed tomorrow but fingers crossed it's back before the end of Tuesday

i can't really respond to every single comment but i really appreciate the updates, especially the one pointing out that more southern areas are being repaired first. i didn't think about that at all

UPDATE: It is 8:45 PM and the apartment complex across from us just got their lights back. 77057"
"77004 power has been out since like 5 in the morning yesterday iirc (and funnily enough, I didn’t have power problems during Harvey at all)."
Protip: the “we are working in your area” message on Entergy’s outage tracker site is a lie designed to placate you. Text them “STAT” to see real outage information and to know if they have started restoration in your area yet.
"77388 has partial power.  The crews come and turn on power all down the main roads for the businesses and schools but they dont take the 5 minutes to open and reset the transformer right next to where they already are for the neighborhoods.    Instead they leave and come back 3 days later to spend the 5 minutes to turn it on.  
Centerpoint needs to be fired.  I dont want to use them anymore.  

They are wasting more travel time then they need to which will add up causing more delays for everyone to get their power back on.  They should be going down the line of transformers instead of zig zagging around spending more time driving then fixing anything."
"Does stating your zip code matter? Because not all 77054 is without power. Can someone tell me what map y’all referring to when you say the map shows green !!!!. Never mind…here is the link for some one equally clueless ( scroll down to see the map)
https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195bcf03ae0c491f9f14bf77f2c43420
So I am in orange that means Centerpoint hasn’t even checked us , green is Ofcourse good, blue means - repair in progress. So …. What does it mean? Does it mean that we will get power later. Sorry for entitled questions , I have had two hours of sleep and I need to crack this code. What are areas that are not colored."
"My mom got a message from centerpoint saying to expect to be out of power for several days, 77011. But we know people in our zip code have power is this a generic message."
"last couple times I've refreshed the site, the # of customers restored has been going *down*."
"If Centerpoint has reached their magical “million” resorted power, then why does it seem that the MORE people are still complaining that they HAVE NO FREAKING POWER?!"
"77077 energy corridor. Power came back at 1:45 today, then thunderstorms came in and the power went back out. It was only on for about 30 minutes 😔"
77021 got power lets gooooo 😎
"Finally have power back in part of our subdivision in 77406. Four trucks out dealing with a tree that fell and ripped down power lines. They still have to deal with a broken utility pole and told a neighbor that would not happen until tomorrow. 

My stepmother is in West U and her neighbor spent hours on hold to get through to a person at CenterPoint who told her that they thought the area all had power when they do not. They had not even had anyone assessing their area. I have been over the help her every day this week since Tuesday and have not seen any power crews in the area but lots of damage."

"77521, Baytown, power has been out since Monday afternoon. 

It seems like they almost got me hooked up yesterday, then I heard a transformer explode somewhere. There's a downed line one house away from me and I haven't seen any crew or anyone even come look at it yet. 

My HOA forwarded a notice from CenterPoint that they expect to have about 50% of people back on by Wednesday afternoon, but that's at least 24 hours too long."
What’s the situation like around 77056 Woodway and Post Oak?
"77030, been without power for a little over 24 hours"
77095 no power still. Long night
"77038, power back up"
"77049 North Shore area. We got power back at 12:37 am. I was not able to report immediately because phone had no charge. This ordeal is finally making me resolve to do all the proper prep.  
Edit to add: What the fuck! The power went out again a few minutes ago. I’m hoping this is just the need for a quick little extra fix to make us all set up for good.  

 4:05 edit: still no power although other very near places do have it. Such a halfass storm and the city is crippled, library not open, short on bus drivers so many buses not running, gas lines everywhere. Spotty electric restoration. This is ridiculous!"

"No power in Alief 77072 Beechnut and Beltway 8.  The HEB and Walmart on 8 have generators and we picked up ice and bread yesterday, but as you might guess, they're out of bananas, deli meats for the most part.  The Texas Boil House attached to that HEB has hot food and the food trucks do as well.

I just checked the Whataburger app and the Whataburger at Fondren and 59 in Sharpstown has power.  That's the closest in a few miles radius from here with power."

Can confirm no power yet at Swamp Plantation in Conroe
my area is not marked in the centerpoint power outage map with any color. does that mean my area will not get power anytime soon?
77062 near the Exploration Greens finally got power.
Any updates for eado/ second ward?
"does anyone know if CenterPoint is releasing phase powers? My office is up, but only the light stuff can turn on such as lights, small plugs. Not heavy duty items like AC or printers can turn on."
"Saw several trucks in the old Fudrucker's parking lot on Kirkwood at 59 in 77477, and a couple on 90 near BW8. About an hour later our old office's power came on. Our new office, also in 77477 and about a mile away from the old office, has no power but we're crossing our fingers."
77401 Bellaire behind the Wal-Mart on South Rice. Still no power. AT&T Cell tower is back on line tho as of last night.
"77584 west Pearland, received power back yesterday morning but now the power is out again once it started raining ugh"
"Had power since yesterday 9AM and it went out again about 15 minutes ago.   
Did receive a text from CenterPoint saying they've detected an interruption in service roundabout the same time.  
Also received a text from Xfinity about the same time that they have an outage.

Looking at other posts about losing power again, as well as xfinity and losing 5G service on my cellphone, all about the same time, makes me think that this is more widespread than something local to my area (which is next to Avalon Terrace in 77581)."
77002 midtown area still no power since 9am yesterday. We had power through the storm but then it suddenly turned off (maybe for repairs?) but it's been more than 24 hours now
77045 Buffalo Speedway and Airport. Power on as of 3:40 pm

"Has anyone successfully syphoned gasoline out of their newer model car? I have full tanks on my cars but cannot get it out of the tank. I know how to syphon but it just isnt working. 


1) i have filled the tube up. Plugged it and put it in the tank. Then release the outside end low to the ground. 


When i blow in the tube i get bubbles. I know it is in the liquid  


2) Built a water bong type syphon to no avail.  


I get a little piddle of fluid but it always stops. "

"77018 w 34th near alba - still no power and my apt is 84 degrees. Thought the nearby businesses getting power would mean mine coming back, but no. Super frustrating since some of my complex has had electricity for days. "
"Any update to 77459? Cartwright and La Quinta? Last I heard, around 11am today, there were linemen in the area. Haven't heard peep since then."
Ain't expecting much but does anyone have an update for 77040 any update as to if and when power might come back on?
"Any news on 77532, the Crosby area? Haven't seen a truck out here yet 🫤"
"77581 Pearland-east or hwy 35-Pearland pkwy/Dixie Farm??
I got home from work yesterday 7/9 a little close to 6pm and power was on. Got super excited and started cleaning and unplugging generator and after 20 minutes power shut off and has yet to come back. Shittypoint drove around for a little after and we thought they were working on it but they left around 7pm and have not been back. Lots of neighbors reported the outage again but shittypoint has not updated anyone"
Any word for 77098 off Buffalo Speedway? I'm starting to get really frustrated that everyone around us has power and it feels like we are a low priority being fewer people without power. I haven't seen any trucks or lineman.
77565 no power in all of Kemah.
"77004, midtown by 288/McGowen. Still no power. It’s insane that it’s going on 72 hours with no power"
"77054 by Holly hall

My complex mostly has power but my buildings and adjacent ones do not"
77070 Lakewood Forest area power came on at 7 pm last night.  At 5 pm prior they flickered 3 times.  So if you get any flickering where you are I guess it means they are working on it.  I’m wishing you all get it very soon.
77080…. Anyone ? There are parts ( Spring Branch) on but lots still out. This is getting too much
"Any update on 77018 near oak forest elementary, they shafted us last time!"

[deleted]
77036 Forum Park still zero power? I’m straight up not having a good time
"I noticed that alot of the street lights that are working are being run off generators (Sugarland and Missouri City ), so the street lights working doesn't mean the area has power "
77069 Champions any updates?
[deleted]
"77441 - updated map went from orange to dark green. Yet we do not have power on the entire block. Only the businesses facing 1093, which were restored the day after the storm."
77478 in brookside. They restored the line that was down in my backyard but did not restore power. Very concerned as this neighborhood has a lot of elderly folks. My mother’s house in 77479 new territory still does not have power. Apparently they were waiting to receive a part that they were missing. Here’s hoping these are all good signs lol
"77011 Lockwood and Navigation no eta for our building, says energized but we have partial power. Called rhythm they can't give an eta either I don't know what to do."
[deleted]
"Well, the side of the street opposite me has power, but nothing on my side. I’m in Oak Forest. 

An interesting twist from some folks on the opposite side they say they have wires down in their backyard, but Centerpoint has still electrified that side of the street. (it doesn’t quite sound right to me, but I’m getting this secondhand.) I could totally believe Centerpoint weaving a dangerous situation in place, and going ahead with starting up the power, just so it could improve its numbers. I wouldn’t have thought it works that way, but at this point, I wouldn’t put anything past Centerpoint."
"77070 on Hargrave right behind Houston Methodist Willowbrook off 249. No power. They assessed on Day 2, but I haven’t seen them come back. I posted a video on my IG of what the damage looks like less than an hour ago: [IG video of downed lines](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9S_CUJpAHD/?igsh=bmthOHE0d3h3dGhh)"
"77088 - Inwood Forest area. No power still. We escaped to Waller to an aunts house that had AC and room to spare, but haven’t had the chance to go home yet. "
"77089, Sageadow along Blackhawk. Power just turned on for like 30 seconds and then went off again. Hopefully that means it's coming back soon

Edit: my mom came back from taking our dog on a walk and said she saw a bunch of a electric trucks a few streets away from us, so now I'm even more hopeful"

Oh god. This weather isn’t going to help
77092 by Clifton middle school back online at 12.15pm
[deleted]
"77571 - Power still out but Mom said she saw 3 Centerpoint trucks near my house. What that means I will see I guess.

Side note for those lucky enough to have a generator and window unit tape up your door jams with masking or duct tape and jam a towel under the door. You have to plan trips and it makes a hell of a noise when opening it but makes a huge difference.

Also the return in the ceiling was just raining down hot air into the room so I closed it, covered with a sheet of foil, and sealed with duct tape.

And all the seals around the windows where the unit is mounted to keep hot AC exhaust from coming back in.

The AC was doing it's best but needed some help, I hope this helps yours."
Any good news for 77373 around spring crossing?
77049 I’m out and there seems to be no sight of center point or workers
What are people without water doing for toileting? My friends said kids at her complex have started going in the parking lot 😳😳😳

"77028 - the neighborhood of Kashmere High School. 
Power came on about 3 pm today (Fri Jun 12) and went back off at about 4 pm.


The outage map shows us currently in blue and has a restoration eta for June 12 end of day. "
77091- Pinemont Plaza (Tidwell and TCJ)-bucket trucks around the neighborhood and CPE says we should be online sometime tonight. Hooooopeful?

77020 near Nance. finally got power around 2pm!!!

[deleted]
"

77011 ( Lockwood & Navigation )

I think the power is back and my water is back, I surely hope people get their powerback, fuck centerpoint"
Still no power 77070 mist ln 😭😩
Power has been out at my house again for 9 hours now in 77441. For 4 hours CenterPoint claimed there wasn’t an issue and then at hour 4 send a message saying it’s planned maintenance and we can’t get any answers or updates as to when the power will be back.
77069 Champions Park Dr on 1960 infront of Target has power. Finally!
"77459 – Colony Lakes near 1092/Murphy and Hwy 6 seems to have power back. Riverstone area behind it as well, as of about 4 hours ago."
"77057, woodway and fountain view.  Still no power, staying with friends.  Tracker is offering no estimation date, so I’m worried that means another week of this.  Appreciate any input from people in the area."

"77477 - Power came back on at our office some time last night. We're near Kirkwood and Airport.

Edit - Centerpoint map still shows us a ""Restoration Date Pending Review"". At least they added some restoration dates to the map, but this is ridiculous."
It so upsetting the surroundings area of my apartment in 77077 shows to be energized but not my side. Even the other apartments  across the street that belong to the same complex shows to to have power.
In what intervals is the outage map updated?
"77012 has nothing in our little blocks. I see power trucks on the north side of Harrisburg around 75th st but no guarantees that will do anything for us.

77061 at Monroe and Rockhill has some low voltage power. Can’t run an AC or power any appliances but lights and ceiling fans work and that is a huge relief."
"77086 got power like 30 min ago. For what it's worth, yesterday we had not ETA. And the new updated map had us under getting power by 15, and south section by 16. The south section got done earlier and now us. So if you want some hope they seem to be working really fast, couldn't ask for more badass linemen."
77063 south gessner/westheimer power back up and running. Good luck to everyone 🤘🏼
77024 chimney rock and i10 power was just restored as of 2 minutes ago
Power is up mist ln apartment 77070 😊

Back on at 77056
"I’m in a nested outage of 40-50 homes. Received word from Centerpoint that they were assessing the outage. I have no idea what that means, but somewhat comforting that they are at least aware of it I guess. 77025  (Academy/N. Braeswood)for reference."
"77055 -- shows energized, but a small group of 77 homes don't have power ""for some reason"" 

I am seriously doubting we will get power even in the next 5 days..."
77380 budde road/sawdust just got power!!!! 🎉🎉🎉

"Apparently my apartment in 77077 in the gentry side - Whittington area has got power. My sister got an email from management claiming to be a full power and my mom called a neighbor to confirm. Hopefully are lights stay on. We are probably going to go back in the morning.


There is hope people, our estimated date was Wednesday and we thought we would just be leeching off from our family friend."
anyone heard anything yet on meyer forest apartments on 77096(not lakeside but the other apartments)
77096 by Herod. Just got power ~830pm. The CenterPoint map has us planned for today. Trucks in the area earlier today.
"77018 - Ella and Lehman, still no power"
"77025 apt Complex on Buffalo Speedway. No power since Monday. CP came and fixed less than half the buildings and the rest of us have been getting conflicting reports on when the power will be fixed. Some agents say EOD everyday, some say no reports found, some say no technician has been assigned. There have been trucks in the area but they wont come help us. It’s more than 150 people without power and there have been some security incidents. I dont know if we are a nested outage and so just left to die in the heat.

Edit: Oh and we show as energized in the map"
"My corner of 77380 has power as of this morning. Our apartment sent out a text and I was able to verify through Xfinity today we are online and have devices connected to the gateway.

"77055 near Westview/Antoine -- just got power back around 2:15pm

Also feel like CP didn't know that my neighborhood was showing as ""energized"" when it really wasn't, they were surprised by it and power turned on a few hours later. Could be coincidence."
77076 near Parker and hardy power is finally back!
77096 we see the centerpoint truck over here but he keeps leaving and coming back. Praying for service today. We have ran out of food. Smh.
"I swear every time I refresh the centerpoint outage page, the outage number goes up."

77006: Finally got power this afternoon around 4:30pm. 🙌🏽
"77459, no power and now no water. It’s getting worse."
"77086 - I think CenterPoint is juking the power restored stats. I have periodically checked their website during the past couple of days. [Occasionally my meter reads that it is “powered on” on their website like in this screen grab.](https://imgur.com/a/kBbbXqC) Power was restored to some of my neighborhood except for the few streets close to my house. A benign, but bad for me scenario is that CenterPoint honestly believes that my power has been restored, so they are not going to send a repair crew."
"Got my estimate and its not until Saturday evening, oh boy. Thanks for literally nothing centerpoint."
"77042, bw8 and briar forest, power just came back!!! 🙌"
77598 still no power.  My neighbors across the street still have lights.  It's been 24 hours now.  I can't sleep.  I have a headache.  The weed isn't working man.
If Centerpoint cannot be trusted to provide updates then how in the world would anybody on Reddit have information? Centerpoint owns the infrastructure. Many (including myself) were out for two weeks with Ike.
"Minimum to marginal wind damage… Yet,  no power in Land of Suggs, 77498"
UPDATE 77070 Cypresswood: Power Restored to 3 buildings as of 9:30AM. CenterPoint vehicles are located at the end of the road. Hope for full restoration by the end of the day. 🙏
"Y’all really should include cross streets whenever posting your zip. 

No power at 77009 W Cavalcade and Airline: in the “assessment” part of the map but multiple bars around me are open so that’s nice"
"Got an update from CentrePoint that they’re assessing the outage around my address and area, no idea if it’s a generic message or if theyre actually doing work.
77581, off Avalon Terrace, no power anywhere in sight."
"77049, near Crosby, just got power back.

Edit: Aaaaand it's gone again."
"I just read that Centerpoint's outage tracking system is offline. So, the numbers for them might be skewed."
Anyone in 77006 got power yet?

Leaving generator and window unit in place, filled up gas cans when I made it to the store for the first time since the Friday before the storm.

Bonus points: Centerpoint says our entire area is energized our Mayor says this is a lie. And that he has spoken to state officials who have assured him the legislature will hold Centerpoint accountable for their bungled response.

I am sure it will be the kind of investigation where they investigate themselves and find no wrong doing.

"Anyone know if Mayde Creek HS has power? I've tried calling, but not sure if they are staffed in the summer anyway. 

(My kid has his ACT there on Saturday. Prepping for it in the heat and dark has sucked, but still would like him to be able to actually take it instead of getting it pushed back from a mental prep POV. Very minor issue all things considered, I know, but he already had a huge last-minute delay with his AP Physics exam thanks to the derecho, so I feel for him with this! It's hard enough being a teenager.)"

"77586 - Seabrook / Repsdorph Rd area. Last night the city of el Lago told residents that centerpoint is going to come into their backyards to assess and fix damage to lines from fallen trees. For good reason—there’s an enormous fallen tree in some guys backyard by loch lake dr off Repsdorph that’s taken down the line that probably goes to us unlucky sods down the road. Centerpoint workers are nearby but are not actively working on clearing this debris, looks like they may have to take someone’s fence down to just get access to the line. Might be a while."

"77088- I saw two electric trucks today. I think they finally “assessed the situation” because, we went from not having a date of restoration on the map  to now it saying the 16th.

Entergy Texas Hurricane Beryl Alert

TEXAS

Crews restore power to more than 90% of customers by Hurricane Beryl

Entergy Texas crews continue working around the clock to restore power to our communities and have successfully restored power to more than 90% of customers impacted by Hurricane Beryl. As of 9:30 a.m. Sunday, approximately 231,400 of the 252,460 impacted customers have been restored.

Strong winds and heavy rainfall caused widespread vegetation-related damage to distribution lines, which is the main cause for extended outages. Restoration crews are using special equipment to reach hard-to-access areas and make repairs as quickly as possible.

The majority of remaining customers are expected to be restored before the end of the day Sunday, with customers in the most heavily damaged areas (Cleveland and New Caney networks) expected to be restored no later than Monday, July 15.

Crews are actively working to restore power to customers near the following areas: Chateau Woods (85% complete), Oak Ridge North (90% complete), Shenandoah (85% complete) and are working to complete restoration efforts in Carriage Hills, Harper's Landing, Forest Hills, Woodloch, Sleepy Hollow and surrounding areas.


**Huntsville Network (includes Corrigan, Groveton, Madisonville, New Waverly, Normangee, North Zulch, Trinity, and surrounding areas)**

There are approximately 800 customers without power. Challenges faced in the Huntsville Network continue to be downed vegetation, and downed poles and wires throughout the network. Special equipment is needed to maneuver through back yards and hard to reach places, which can slow repairs.

Damage assessments are 99% complete and have found:

44 poles down

116,700 feet of downed wire

23 damaged transformers

107 broken crossarms

Crews have been able to restore power back to about 95% of the customers in the Huntsville Network.

Crews will be working to restore power to approximately 800 customers today, with 480 in East Trinity/ Trinity County, 80 in Leggett off Hwy 59, 80 in Huntsville and 160 in Corrigan/ Groveton."

Cell service has also gone from 5G (Verizon) to 4G. Moving backwards."
Anyone know when the power would restore in the 77498 area ? 15270 Voss rd to be specific
"So - I've been without power now for coming up on 3 days (420am Monday morning).  (I'm fortunate to have bought a generator and kept it running over the last few years).  I live in what is supposedly the hardest hit zip code in Brazoria County, the county where the storm made landfall.  

It makes sense to me that after a hurricane comes through, there will be some power outages and that some of those outages will take a while to be resolved.  

In my area, they've been working over the past 6 months at replacing wooden poles with metal ones, but they were nowhere near done.  I see a lot of people angry at Centerpoint for taking so long (and hey, I'm going to have a party of some sort when my AC comes back on) and Greg Abbott for being on a foreign trip during a crisis.  

My question is - has anyone seen analysis that shows that Centerpoint was especially bad at responding?  That political policy in Texas contributed to the current widespread outages?  I'm asking in good faith, I really don't know anything about how this infrastructure is managed.

Edit:  Yeesh.  Ask a question ..."
"We lost power and Internet for about 3 weeks after Hurricane Ike in 2008 , and that was only Category 2.  I'm thinking roughly at 2-3 weeks, give or take."
Anyone tried airbnb or listing on it if u have space?

"77384- Entergy is no better  than Centerpoint.   Been out since 7AM yesterday.   We have the most random times too, 24 hours last summer with no storm or explanation.   Everyone's patience is gone."

Why DOES THIS TOWN ACT LIKE EVERY STORM THAT HAPPENS IS ITS FIRST EVER STORM!??? Are they DUMB OR FUCKING STUPID
Is it getting any better for you guys down there? There is a lot of articles written about there still being issues. I saw center point or whoever said some would have to wait weeks for power?
"Probably an unpopular opinion -- but Centerpoints communication / online updates are far more improved than they were during the derecho. It's super frustrating for all, but given that Centerpoint is dealing with the biggest utility crisis in the USA at this time...I am cutting them some slack, not a lot, but some."
People relax- try 11 days with no power( hurricane harvey).You will be fine for a few days- you should have prepared for this outcome.
"Thank you for this. Ercot and Centerpoint should be posting this for clarity.

If they know areas won't have power for days, let people know they should evacuate.

This no transparency to cover themselves makes me sick."
Where do you find this info?
Thank you.  Is there any valid reason that Centerpoint or Ercot can't share this directly?  What's with the secrecy...
Really good post. Thanks 
"Very informative, thank you."
"i'm sure i'm not the only one, but even with power restored to homes, some of the bedrooms, etc. are not getting lights and outlets not working even when resetting the breakers. when they restore power, are they checking everything when they do it to the homes? Seems like something on their checklist was missed."
Do you have any updates for the today for the Heights? Thank you for all this information
[deleted]
Omfg. Thank you for making me laugh. So true.
"Come on, they're just a tiny mom and pop business. They can't afford to update us all. They're doing the best they can with what little money they have"
"Not a time, but this shows where your area is in terms of assessment or in progress repair.


https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195bcf03ae0c491f9f14bf77f2c43420"
Probably shift rotation. Hate CenterPoint and everything they do but the lineman are truly heroes having to deal with this shit for potentially several weeks
"They’re also waiting for crews to arrive from out of town. They said once they arrive tomorrow morning, they’ll do safety training and then start working. lol"
That would be great. I came to my parent’s house to crash because they had power… any now the power is gone…. I would love to know if I should just go back to my place because it’s much more comfortable there.
"they've evolve to ""resenteeism"""
"Unfortunately for me, the Whataburger that is within 10 minutes walking distance to my house is open, but my actual neighborhood still has no power."
"Mine is still out in 77058, glad to hear yours is back though! Fingers crossed this means the rest of us in the area will get power back soon"
Well tell them they missed my street!
"I’m 77058 too & still out, you just gave me hope!"
77059 and power is still out in my neighborhood </3
Still no power in 77058 where I live in 😭
"Neat Louetta and 249, nothing yet. Just got back from a drive and looks like the closest area with power is near 45 :("
[deleted]
I’m around that area (77066) and still nothing too 🥲
Still nothing near Jones rd/1960
Nothing yet at 249 & Perry area. It's a little after 8pm right now.

"yeah, they should be okay. my cats are very comfy and if anything, still fairly active all day. i was lucky and had tons of bottled water in the fridge so if they need something cool it'll probably still be cold enough to cool them down

for the future, i recommend having very large freezer bags filled with ice to keep in the freezer. they come in handy when the power is out and you need to keep things cold in your fridge

cats stay hydrated easier with wet food if you have access to any at all. some gas stations and lots of HEB locations are open if you have to buy something for them.

best wishes for you and your babies!"
Meanwhile they announced that goal late on Monday after having already reconnected hundreds of thousands. The implication was they would connect 1 million between Tuesday and Wednesday.
I was just thinking that.
Funny you say that about 20 minutes ago it wouldn’t update then out of nowhere shot up to 980k+
"Oh, have they finally started reporting the total restored since Beryl, instead of just a rolling number for the last 24 hours? At least that is a more meaningful number to report in this kind of situation."
aww that’s terrible may she rest in peace :(
77055
I’d bet everything that I own that they don’t work overnight
"This is a very very very small subreddit compared to how many people there actually are in Houston.

Then you got a smaller amount checking this subreddit.

And finally, a lot of people won't respond if they get power back on, they'll move on.

So that's terrible proof."
They aren't working at night. Its all a scam.
This should have its own post
"I see the map, but no indicators of power on/off 😢 Even opened the map on Google Maps, saw the legend but no markers on map :/"
"It’s all just different shades of green. Like, who does this make feel better?"

Back during the 2021 freeze there were a few blocks of Midtown without power for what… 2 or 3 weeks? It’s all a blur. I just remember it seemed like virtually everyone else had power except our block near Randall’s.
"Your power can come on at any moment. That’s what makes it sort of relieving and tough at the same time. 

In May, I was out for 6 days in 77043. We were only out for around 6-7 hours this time. So have some hope. Centerpoint is working fast on this one."
"My parents lights came on last night a little after midnight, but they are up near Conroe"
"When the derecho hit, I was 1 of 6 houses that didn’t receive power until that Tuesday. Everyone else around us had power that Saturday. Now I have power as of a few hours ago and no one around us does. Feel like a payback where no body really wins. Except Centerpoint, of course. They always win when we suffer."
Lazybrook neighborhood was just restored! 77008
7th and 6 1/2 Street seem to still be down but it's pockets
I am in a small apartment complex on Beauchamp near White Oak and we are still without power.
Do you happen to know about the rice village area? Thanks
8 mo pregnant wife and a toddler. This isn’t fun
I’m sorry to hear that. Hope yours comes back on first today.
"Same boat. Pregnant partner and a 15 month old.
Our neighborhood is a large circle surrounding the inner/smaller one. The smaller one has power and the rest of us surrounding them don’t.
Fucking sucks"
I’m just south of Heights Highschool - got it back last night but as I was driving saw so much of the neighborhood was still dark. 
"Real.

I’m 77377, saw linemen near/in the neighborhood yesterday around 1 or 2., and then at a nearby church. 

Still no power and haven’t seen any since."
What area?
"From North Jersey, similar experiences as you. Centerpoint is the main provider here (think com Edison in NYC) and they are absolute balls. Look forward to the beryl & derecho surcharge coming to your bill in the near future"
"I live near Shepherd and 12th. The stores on the intersection all have power, the houses do not."
Paiinnnn
This gives me hope 😮‍💨
"Apartment by us in 77077 got power, our entire neighborhood is still without. Centerpoint energy trucks were there but now gone. Shitshow all around"
I concur
Yes. Also in 77019 it’s 335am and still no power. Streets behind and in front of us never lost power tho. So strange. 
Imagine living near the bars on white oak where people are coming out to party with the lights fully operational and your pregnant wife is at home with no power in 90 degree heat. This is my life. I swear to god Centerpoint should burn for this as this is criminal how disorganized they are. The phone and online platforms to even report outages are out too
77098 I’ve abandoned hope
"My location doesn't have a map estimate but we got bucket trucks in the streets and the Mayor emailing about all be it slow but progress.

For tonight I am not hopeful but tomorrow, maybe."
Sounds about right.
Saaaaame. Xfinity sent something too about it being restored to my house. We’re still dark and have been since Monday at 5a
Im so so sorry. Please hang in there
Hang in there mam! Go seek help at a cooling center or from a friend. Its a challenging time but you'll make it on the other side before you know it!
Ug mines is still down. But glad to see you have power. Hopefully ours will be up soon too.
77024 as well but still no power :/
77024- Cheval/Heights on Katy apartments still have no power as of 4:30pm
"At one point earlier this morning, the customers affected number went up before it went down lmao."
"It’s been frozen in the vicinity of 1,360,000ish the entire morning."
They removed that metric from the site
I'll drink to that. I'm over in Richmond and have yet to receive power. Already looking at getting a heavy duty back up generator to power the whole house. 
"Barely. Also in 77471, it’s like every other block has power and you can see a few streets with some and some without. It’s unbearable, almost 3 days without power."
"77339 - got power back yesterday morning and as soon it started raining today its gone…again.. I’m so fustrated, like how?!?"
Not me still lakeside neighborhood. Map has been partially energized all week but no one seems to have power except for some generators
that’s my wonder too
I work from home and I'm the only one on the team without power at this point. My boss and team have been pretty gracious about this week but I was also on vacation the week before. I fulfill administrative functions and the FY starts July 1. I feel like a 3rd week without me is gonna be a hard sell.
same here 6 hours later with nothing
77007 memorial dr (river side) and no power/water
Figuratively your neighbor in the same situation. Townhouses nearby seem to have power. Partner and I drove around last night and our neighborhood is like a chessboard of power/no power. 
"Have water but no power, near Truth BBQ"
"dont have power/water either since monday morning, in rice military"
"Power is up as of 4pm, still no running water

EDIT: water came back around 7pm"
No power. Near cleveland park
Yeah if you dont have power atp I'd say its a very high chance of not having it until Sunday. They got their 50% number and unfortunately we were in the wrong half
"The data supports it.

From 10:30 to 22:00 last night the affected customers number dropped by 367,675.

From 22:00 to 13:50 the number dropped by 39,584."
The thought of a powerful hurricane coming is terrifying after the last few months in Houston.
It wasn't a nearly non hurricane. Intensified to close to cat 2. Another day over the Gulf and we'd have been dealing with a cat 4 easy
Including my mother and I who she in heart failure and I have had heat stroke twice and each time get easier and more dangerous. So this is REALLY not good. And we've already ran out of fuel for our generator but the truck is being held in place by a tree. So can't go exploring for gas. So no fans. No power to our fridge and freezer. It is really sucking.
The storm was actually less severe than predicted.   Centerpoint needs to be fired.
77096 also. 2/3 of my apartment complex had their power restored on teusday. The other 1/3 is still in the swampy heat.
What part of 77096 are you? I’m near MPVA and last I heard from neighbors we were still without power.
Maybe no power until wednesday..
"same general area! it's only about 77° so far and cats can withstand lots of heat. mine are doing well and are, if anything, too active this early in the day 😂 they don't feel overheated until temps get into the hundreds so your babies should be okay for a while"
Same. Very frustrating 
Yes it is!!! No power!!!  77063
Yes it is!!! No power!!!  77063
Yes it is!!! No power!!!  77063
And it’s gone. 
"Been through all of them since 1985.   Approaching  our record of being without power since Ike.   

Still nowhere near as long as Alicia 83’.  That was two weeks according to Dad."
"I just came to the car to get some ac, 77459 we lost water sometime in the past 3 hours as well . My poor cats "
hang in there.
I got maybe 30 mins of sleep. Can’t even read or do anything comfortably because it’s 95+ in the house.
What part of Missouri City?
how long did you have it for? do you think it's because of the storm out there now?
We did get power back! Showed partial energized probably around noon or late morning? We had no power at that time but then at like 5pm we got power back!
"My mom is trying to give them benefit of the doubt. 

I keep saying ""partially energized"" means fuck all"
"They gave you an estimate:  Your estimate is ""We at Centerpoint don't know shit!"""
"my entire circuit was supposed to be restored today. it shows fully restored on the most updated map. NOTHING on my circuit has power, no stores, not even traffic signals"
The whole fuckin streets in the dark and not a 1 truck so what a magical switch will just turn all the shit on simultaneously. 😒 fuck ya map
same
UPDATE POWER IS ON
Power is on!!!!
Thank you for posting this!
Do any of y’all know if 16th/18th and Columbia got turned back on? I evacuated but desperately want to be able to come home.
"🤞🏼🤞🏼 We’re 77096 over here, too. Hoping this means power comes back in the near future"
Some of us in 77096 have it and others don't. Super wierd
im just sitting in my car watching them lol
"77096 here too but no power near Meyerland Middle, last I heard. If anyone gets power back in this area please reply. Currently away soaking up A/C at my sister’s."
I'm in this zip too. Any update?
im just sitting in my car watching them lol
Where are they? I'm in 77096 and this makes me hopeful.
It's been there since midnight 
It's actually not even a widget--just plain text that some goon is manually updating. Maybe they fell asleep?
Update: he wasn’t there for long. Probably was just assessing for damage at this point 🫥
[](https://emojipedia.org/folded-hands)
Thanks for the update! I feel like we’re always the last ones to get power back in 77007. I can see people with power in every direction I look.
Thank god I am in Westpark and Wilcrest 😭😭😭
Exact same situation by 77096 North Braeswood and Chimney Rock.
i keep hearing people say 77096 got power… but where? i live down the street from harod elementary school 🤪
what is the line that i can actually get through  to call them? 713-207-2222 and 800-332-7143 are not working. is there an email even?
77024 and 77080 always seem to be the last. It sucks
Optimistically maybe there taking down lines to do repairs and when they energize the repaired number will jump significantly. But that’s just hopium
😭😭😭😭
Yes.
"I'm north of i10 and tc jester, I'm still trying to remain hopeful we'll get power tonight "
Where in 77007? Thanks!
Yay!!! 
Literally! I’m seeing all these posts of people getting their power back and I’m sitting here sweating and trying to comfort my cats like when is it my turn 😭
If it makes you feel any better I’m in 77092 and nobody in my area has power either. Zero power 43rd to Pinemont on Antoine
I’m in the same boat. The street across from me has had power since Tuesday and I’m over here green with envy sweating my ass off
I’m with you on that. Seems like everyone but my side of the street has power. This has to come to an end soon.
Same here. Other side of the street has had power since Tuesday. My side is still out
My power is back on and I’m down the road from st Thomas
Dammn the power is getting so close to us. Ugh what a tease
Yes same here!
🤝🏾
By Wednesday. Not tomorrow. 
Press release or insider information?
Dirtbag branch
How are you doing now? My family is also in 77504
I found a Walmart with power and ice and coolers nearby yesterday (FM 529 / Highway 6). Check around if it's safe and your food still has any life left.  Feels really shitty to have to throw hundreds of dollars of food away
"I feel like that's the worst part of not having lights, not being able to sleep through it. I wish I was still a drinker during times like this lol."
So sad
Try going to a Costco. What area are you in?
They only work on the power from 9-5pm... Sorry bud
"i‘m hopeful then, also 77062 but without power"
Which neighborhood?  We’re in Bay Glen and still out.
 I just spoke to someone from McCue rd and they said centerpoint will send someone over on Wednesday! I hope that's not true :'(
"During the tornado I got about a dozen messages from Comcast that my internet was restored and it wasn't. 3 weeks later it finally restored on the same day a tech was supposed to come out. Never got a text message saying it was restored.

I wonder if these companies even know who actually uses their services."
Here’s hoping it gets turned on soon. I got the same text last time and it was on maybe within an hour or so.
why wouldnt they have all the necessary compnents already omg.
You can't be serious...
Where in 77096?
I feel you. My kitties are warm but otherwise their mood seems ok. Hoping you get power soon.
77379 update - there were a bunch of utility trucks pulling into Klein high school. Also in the vintage area near Aldi. Fingers crossed 77379!!!!!!!
I am hearing that Petco is acting as a pet friendly cooling center. Maybe check them out?
I’ve been saying this all day 😭
Facts 😂😂
Same situation in my apartment complex. Real tough to stay positive
Are you at Gables CityWalk? We are in Waterford square and still no power and no estimate.
I am marked for July 15th but just had power restored 77008 14th St
"Map says my house is ""energized"" when it's not. :/"
I live in 70056. Got my power back in my apartment complex around 8pm. Hopefully this means the rest of the area is soon to follow.
Same! In 77095. Lost around 6am and came back on for 2 hours (7-9pm) and been out since.
Off Queenston & Longenbaugh no power since 6:30 Monday morning 🥲
What area is that is a store nearby for gas
Yup my dads house has power but I don't 2 streets away. Good times. Also feels like our grid is always done last no matter what. Really sucks.
"Same, but in north Houston, and no sight of a center point truck - which is just phenomenal, thousands of home out here and absolutely not one truck in sight"
no power still
I’ve seen three center point trucks all down Fry road…where power is on…
SAME but no generator trigger pull sadly
im 77450 on mason by creech elementary and i got power around 7pm tday !! my wifi went out after tho but power is still on. hopefully ur soon !
ok jk my wifi is back !
"You have to report it online or through phone. I've already done so three times online. My transformer popped behind us, so everyone around our block doesn't have lights. The blocks around us do though"
At some point if it is showing energized (green on the map) I would call the emergency line to report it.
They said they'd have ETA's on the map tomorrow.  Which will either be a welcome relief or absolutely soul crushing
"From the amount of commenters who've mentioned seeing groups of lineman trucks sitting in random business parking lots (not restaurants), Centerpoint seems to have plenty of workers but aren't doling out assignments promptly enough to keep them all busy."
"I just called in the downed wire at Ashford Pkwy and S Dairy Ashford (which I suspect is causing that outage), and Centerpoint said they had been unaware of it until now and will send someone out. Perhaps more importantly, they seemed to be unaware that the Briar Forest / Dairy Ashford neighborhood lacked power, because they show that the circuit is flowing (they initially told me to try resetting my breaker). They generated an outage report and said a tech will be out, but ""due to high workload,"" blah blah blah, etc."
"It's about 10 degrees cooler outside right now, can you open the windows?"
Where in 77008?
"Maybe a dozen houses down on my same street ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE ROAD they have power. Across the street and behind my house, they have power. 

Strong /r/fuckyouinparticular energy."
"It's moved through fast, here and gone in 30 mins. They'll be back soon."
"I saw a Centerpoint person driving out of my complex in 77090. Had hope, but this storm has killed it. "
Austin or DFW
Same. And my power just came back on at low voltage for ten minutes. What a tease.
They just dropped the new outage map and we don't even have an estimated restoration date. Wtf have y'all been doingggggg
"In 77373 as well, and nothing. It’s absolutely awful. I’m on the freaking edge."
"77373 too. Trash day today so everything in the fridge was thrown out. I don't have shit for food. I ate some spaghettios straight out of the can this morning. I'm out of clothes and don't even know where I can find an open laundromat. 


Restoration pending review my hairy ballsack."
Yeah lot of trucks in the heights today 
did you get power back?? (taking a test at the Pearson center near there and trying to figure out if it has power lol)
Not until they bring back the Mushroom Swiss.
The whataburger closest to me is still closed unfortunately
I mean it was this way in May too. They know they can get away with it so they will.
"The map is temporarily available here, if you click through a few error messages first, but it won't tell you much. https://origin-gis.centerpointenergy.com/origin_otr/

Edit: And some idiot downvoted this information??

Edit 2: Centerpoint seems to have completely shut it down now. It really did not provide much information when it was still available. Just these vague bubbles with total numbers of outages inside them, that didn't indicate the extent of the area they each applied to, and didn't provide any restoration estimates."
Just came from there!
You’re the second person to post about the whataburger app; can I ask why it’s helping?
"When I was driving to my hotel last night I passed a stadium. the parking lot was packed with FEMA distaster recovery center trailers like mobile rooms, showers, water, laundry, etc. 

Please check the list at the bottom of this link. They might be able to give you a place to cool off, take a shower and clean your clothes. 

https://www.fema.gov/disaster/4798

Center locator : https://egateway.fema.gov/ESF6/DRCLocator#"
Sorry man. Maybe you can go to a gym and get a day pass to shower?
This is our first hurricane experience and we moved here in January from north Mississippi. 😭
I’m honestly so fed up from the constant grid issues. I’m planning on moving out of houston when I get the chance.
"they just crossed 1M+ customers restored - goal reached!   
[https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/](https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/)"
"77024 near Town & Country, no power here either. 😓"
"77024 Hedwig Village, no power here either."
"Same zip code, near Antoine, nothing yet"
"Same zip, us too"
I’m in 77429 and I got power back at about 3 ish. I’m super close to 290 though. Hopefully soon yall!
Can you get a hotel?
"The active outages keeps climbing, too. 
Yesterday afternoon there were 1.2 million affected within Houston. This morning it was 1.7 million. 😒"
Where did you get updates from?
Lucky ducky! I’m close by and still waiting
Pearl?
"I work in that area and they're expecting no power tomorrow as well. It's all speculation, though."
"Chunks of it N of 11th and E of Yale that was out came back last night and today. The map is out of date and even my account on centerpoint's website says ""power out"" when its actually on."
"Entire neighborhood near the high school is listed on the map as ""energized"" but we've all been without power since 7am Monday."
Power just came on here
[deleted]
that’s my intersection but my centerpoint account still says power off
Nice! I hope they head east down 16th
I’m in 77007 and the starbucks and mcdonalds across the street got power days ago.. it’s so messed up
So excited to hear this! It’s felt like no repair crews have been in Rice Military these past few days.
Yes majority of linemen are contractors. Good to see a truck finally.  They were no where to be seen last few days
"Hey, any updates? Thanks."
[deleted]
The new map. Though it's still not updated yet.
Just updated a few minutes ago with ETA.
No ETA for me :( just says “we will continue to provide estimated restoration times as they become available”
"Where are you finding eta? I looked up my address but can’t find 

This link right? 

https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195bcf03ae0c491f9f14bf77f2c43420"
When I reload the map it still doesn't show estimates. Is it a new link?
"It says my work doesn’t have power but I do, so I don’t think this is accurate"
77429 Just got power back. Huffmeister and Telge. Map shows I wasn’t gonna get it back til tomorrow.
it's on the map
"Some people got their estimate this afternoon in an email, a text, and/or an automated phone call from Centerpoint. It seems that their contact systems can't handle sending out this many messages simultaneously, so some people receive some of Centerpoint's messages but not others."
Do you know if 77459 near 1052 and Hwy 6 got power??
Thank God! 
Exactly. We cannot let them escape after this!!! So many people are suffering for reasons that shouldn't be
"Posted in a Rice Military FB group:

“Just spoke to a CNP agent. She was very nice. Said only 149 calls have come in regarding outages (in 77007) and 1100 customers are without power. No restoration time though. call 800-245-2377. We need more people to call and report their outages!”"
"Yeah, and it’s only gone up in the two hours I’ve been awake."
"glad the pain is over for you. here’s hoping to be next :,)"
"So did 77042 near Woodchase park, I hope it means power will come soon!"
Yea it went out here in 77040 a few times but came back up so keeping fingers crossed 
77007 TC Jester and Egbert St. Cottage Grove East. My block and around the corner on Detering still have no power. Seems like we are the last ones in this part of the neighborhood. There is still a pole down on Detering near Egbert. I also saw alot of repair crews staged at the railyard this morning so hopefully we will get our power back soon!
I live down Washington on Shepherd basically and still no power as well. I work with Silver Eagle Distributors and last I heard from them (yesterday) their corporate offices/distribution center is still without power. Can't believe CPE hasn't worked on that yet. Hope we all get better news today.
">  how the fuck has a state of emergency/disaster not been called yet?

It was already declared for nearly half the counties in the state, including Harris, before the storm even hit."
"Jamaica these days is actually a well run, functioning country where the current administration has absolutely killed it at reducing debt and making things better."
The area of Texas affected by this storm does have about 3x the population of Jamaica.
Same. Saw that a part of 77004 got power back but not sure which part
Thanks for the update! I’m 77354 and left to stay with some family but it’s hard to get updates on outages from center point
77375 here as well and still without power
77375 here and still no power since 6:45am.
"Same zip, in Shady Acres off 25th, no power."
what streets r u on in 77006?
I saw the Starbucks on Richmond by Dunlavy had power so fingers crossed 🤞🏻
Thank you for this update! 
Thank you for this! I’m right there in that area.
People across the street from me have power........ (77095 Copper Lakes)
77095 Barker cypress & tuckerton has power
"I got up last night at around 2:30 am to get fresh batteries for the fan. I  heard something like a car going down the street and when I looked out the window it was a CP truck. Power was on about 3 hours later.  So yes, theyre working under the covert of darkness."
"They work through the night. They work 24/7.

Last night the additional out of state crews hadn’t started yet but they are out tonight."
"I feel you, in 77498 neighborhood behind the Home Depot"
"Chimney rock and woodway is on but last I saw voss and woodway was still out.  I’m near fountain view / woodway.  Neighbors lights came on last night but only about half the neighborhood (not my own, unfortunately).  

Will you reply if you see any changes?"
Need to get the fuck out of this state asap
Let the self back patting commence.
Guaranteed they will be on Twitter congratulating themselves.
"Just about to say the same thing how crazy is that. 1,258,741 affected and 1,005,844 restored."
Got power back this evening in 77008. Shepherd and 16th
"Responded to another comment with this info, but apparently a tree fell on power lines over there and that is likely why it's taking so long. I really hope it gets back soon for you"
"Same zip, which part are you in? I'm at Cypresswood and Cutten. "
I'm in the same area near the Methodist hospital. No power here but I can see the hospital has power from my apartment.
Ty for the update 😭🙏
Looking for info on 77069 Wunderlich myself. If I see your area I’ll reply back here
Thank you! This gives me hope. We live off of Sienna Parkway and it sounds like they're getting closer.
They're still working at this hour??
Houston Strong. Energy Corridor is expected to be fully reEnegerized in 9 days.
WHERE!! We’re 77096 but the very tippy northwest of the zip code area
77339- I spoke with a line worker this afternoon. He told me it’s looking like Monday at least til the power is back.
Oh lord. We getting close. I’m on Birdsall so hopefully not long now.
Do you mind sharing the streets? Im in Wilcrest and Westpark
Incredibly frustrating how they’re manipulating the data to look like they’re keeping their promises. We also do not have power but apparently on the map it says we should
Same here
Same. Don’t know what to do.
Because we havent restocked transformers from when we needed them back in may.
I have the same suspicion about our area. At least let us know that and be transparent about waiting for a part? At this point I just want some more information.
Ours blew Tuesday night …so it’s likely
"I'm in that zip and have had power since Wednesday 11 PM

Our neighbors 2 doors over don't have power, we're running them an extension cord. The whole thing seems entirely random."
Damn that’s a long time 😮what area
I got the same notification (7-19) AFTER they restored my power tonight. Make it make sense! Best of luck to you!
Pretty sure they sent that to the remaining people without power because mine also said the 19th.
"77057, same thing"
"77004, I just got that notification too 😭"
77006 same notice.
It's insane none of these resources were pre-staged
"By ""end of"" Wednsday. :("
"I drove around a while yesterday and some today and over the span of both days only saw ONE truck, on Little York between HWY 6 and Eldridge"
"I haven't seen any wires down, but I also haven't seen a single lineman anywhere on the southwest side of town.


Edit: Just to follow up on this and set the record, our power just came back up. A bit over 48 hours which was just about the same as we experienced after Ike. "
I think I will head out to Dallas today. I can’t risk getting fired from work
"I think the earth was a bit cooler then
I would hope

If not
Damn I know why then Wild West cowboys drank alot"
There was a lot less concrete back then.
"Like others said, believe it or not it was not this fucking hot back then, even in the 70's. My parents lived in over crowded single family homes with large families, no AC, and they said they slept with windows open and fans and they were fine. "
Just make sure to wipe front to back
Ugh. Makes me so mad. Y’all don’t even have traffic lights right now. Dangerous!
"Same zip, and I feel ya. Saw four work trucks but now nothing. I’ve lost hope of getting power back this week. They may remember us sometime next week. "
"I""d encourage people who have power back to fill out the form, too, and give others hope."
"So where’s the map? The link is a Google forms page

Jk. I see the map now, internet just loading slow due to no power 😭"
Send them a check for the value of “Pending Review”
"Same zip, still out. Though I had a flicker about an hour ago 🤷"
It's working but it's bs. We have 6 or so homes with power out of 68 and the tracker is reporting 1 home out. With the outage submission website nerfed the numbers are not close to accurate.
My mom's house in 77059 got power 30 mins ago. Immediately went back to my apt 5 mins away in 77058 and still out...
*power
"Same, 77007 by velvet taco and chevron "
"Same area! No power, came on this am for like 20 seconds like you said. "
Any recent updates? We live near there and got an email that it had been restored then immediately got another saying they know there’s outages in our area…
I think almost all HEBs have generators
Thanks for the update. Not all heroes wear capes.
"Solidarity, neighbor. It always seems like we're the last back online"
"I'm losing hope it'll be any time soon. It's miserable.  Hang in there, neighbor."
I think we will be. They always get to us last. My cats are hot and im running out of food :( 
Same neighborhood still no power 🥲
Let’s hope!
Oh man I was so happy when I saw them just now and came to post here then saw this comment. They’ve been working there for 20 hours at this point!?!?
Same in 77098
Same by me
"Hopefully it's not out for 3 weeks.

Spectrum went down in Austin today. Related?"
Same here ... Out in 77407 and doesn't look like we are getting power till Friday... I'm up and can't go sleep... Need help
Get a sheet damp and use it as a blanket. It’s god awful at first but it works to keep you cool.
"Take a cool shower right before bed, and point a battery-powered fan at your bed."
Water bottle shower. I got a wife and kiddo. It’s rough. Hang in there!!!!!
"i'm in the same boat, i literally used water, slapped it on my body, and fanned myself until i was cool enough to sleep and every time i woke up sticky i did the same thing lol. the feet burning is the worst part cause it makes it so hard to thermoregulate"
I slept on the floor the other night. The bed and couch materials hold my body heat. I put down a thick yoga mat and used a light blanket. I had a crick on my neck but the rest of my body felt fine and I stayed cooler.
"City of Houston has cooling centers open, if you really need somewhere to go and get out."
Thanks for the glimmer of hope for 77070 <3
Lyndon ??
Super helpful to know the Grant Kroger is open. Thanks neighbor!
Got power back last night in 77070. I’m on 1960 near Perry Rd so it could happen today
I'd wager we won't see power until late tomorrow if not Friday
"Yeah I’m at 249/Cypresswood, still no power. But I’m seeing others in the 77070 zip have had it restored. Really hoping it’s back up today before I get off work at 5 but I’m not optimistic :("
"HEB on 290 (Fairfield Market) is open today.  We just grabbed some ice and they weren't busy.

Im hoping Jones/1960 area is restored.  We are dying out here."
great news.  anyone know about West 18th/Rutland?
Don’t need the help but you’re awesome and hope someone who needs it sees this message!
Update: it worked!!!! We have power! If you see a downed line definitely call the centerpoint emergency line and report it!
I think I should thank you! It just got back on!
"Still no power at our office in 77477. But, map seems to show they are at least working on it."
"That POS map showed my sister's house in 77498 having power yesterday in green, before they added the new color of dark green, and she still doesn't have power.  Meanwhile they showed my house in 77478 as Orange and not assessed, even though I had power.   "
Kroger on Wirt had power Tuesday? Went there and all their power is up and credit cards working.
"It's possibly due to the storm rolling through currently. My mom lives near Dairy Ashford and Briar Forest and gained power about two hours ago, only to lose it again thirty minutes ago."
"If it comes back, mind giving another update?  Have some friends staying here who would love to know!"
"I live in the same area. The power came back at about 1:45 this afternoon. Then thunderstorms came through, and the power went out again. It was only on for about 30 minutes."
"My friend lives on the south side of Westheimer and dairy Ashford. Behind what used to be slick willies. He has power, not sure when he got it though"
Well at least there's a light at the end of this dark god forsaken tunnel. I hope it's sooner though. 
"We’re Kirkwood and Southlake and wow does this suck! Was happy to see we went from orange to blue on the map but so did most of the city so I’m trying not to get my hopes up. Hang in there, friend!"
Cornish and tc same. 
 Cross streets?
Also on 14th near heights HS and no power. Really hope this gets us closer 😭
UPDATE JUST GOT POWER
such compassion!
Same
Did it come back on yet?
did it come back on yet？
I know I shouldn’t but 77096 getting power back is giving me little morsels of hope
I am also in 77088 right across from the college and we got a text saying the same thing about 20 minutes ago still nothing
"hey, power still out?"
[deleted]
Let’s hope they get it done today! 🙏🏼
Lots of people have late dates and are getting their power. Dont despair 💖
"Yeah fuck Centerpoint's claims about ""essentially everyone"" having a restoration date. We are a nested outage in an 'energized' area as well, but I have scoured our neighborhood and can't even find what's causing it.

We tried to get ahold of someone yesterday and they put us on hold for 20 minutes, then hung up. Next time we called and pressed zero the automated message just told us we were unable to speak with an operator."
"Saw lots of trucks in old town spring this morning, hopefully something soon."
We got ours back like an hour ago!
Which streets?
"The outage tracker hasn’t updated since 7:45pm, not sure what’s going on, but better to be safe/comfortable than sitting/waiting on Centerpoint! The lack of updates with this storm have been awful - Last update I received via email was at 230am, mentioning they were assessing damage…as of 835pm, still no power or updates."
"Fema will likely cover lodging expenses if you choose to leave, and I would use the derecho recovery as an analog for the restoration priority in use now assuming you were impacted in that.

I was out of power for 4 days so I'm not expecting power to my area until Thursday at the earliest"
During the delrecho it took 4 days for me. I knew peeps in Baytown during Ike that lost it for weeks
Or purchase a heavy duty back up generator capable of powering your entire house
"EXACTLY. And, if you guys are still without power, SAFELY make sure you cover your generators! Do NOT leave them out in the rain! They will die, I promise!!!! They sell generator tents at Academy. I’ll look for a link and try to post it. Also, if you’re going to attempt to move it to a safer place, PLEASE TURN IT OFF FIRST!!!!! For people who are moving them into their garages, open ALL doors facing to the outside, set it right near the opening of the garage door with the exhaust facing OUTSIDE!!! Please do not place it anywhere NEAR your houses!!! I know this sucks ass, but please take precautions for fire, carbon monoxide poisoning, etc. 🥵🥵🥵🥵"
I got so excited when I saw 77379 thinking our area was getting power back. Ours went out around 5:30am.
Also nada
I'm in the same zip and lost mine around 9 AM
77063 . No power but have water 
So tomorrow? Lol
If you’re the only one on the street without power you should check your fusebox. Might just need to flip the main breaker.
Still without power in 77023 :(
"Cold shower right before bed, two Benadryl and a battery powered fan got me through the night "
columbia and i10. they were headed n on columbia
Which hotel
Yeah I got an email at 6am saying they were working on our area. Almost noon and nothing unfortunately.
Also 77040 around Hollister and Tidwell. About 2 hours ago the power flickered for like 2 seconds but then immediately went back out. So maybe thats a positive sign?
"Which part are you in?

77083 - Mission Bend closer to HWY6 and Bellaire, no power.

However two reports from yesterday's thread mentioned power for 77083 in Mission Glen and Beechnut/Eldridge."
Are you 77005 by any chance?  I just left my West U home this morning to bring my 13 month old to my parents in Tomball.
Which part? Some areas never lost power… my area was still out as of this morning.
What about south of 11th?
85.  Taking cold shower rinses every couple hours helps.
"88 with 66% humidity, probably reach 90 before sundown.  Going to open my windows tonight for that crisp 80 degree 90% humidity air."
"81, I’m close to Montrose"
"I’m in 77006 and still have nothing 😭 I’m praying the power is coming my way, I’m going crazy in the heat"
"My office is in 77477. We're in a mostly business district, with nearby neighborhoods. No power, and haven't seen any Centerpoint trucks in the area all day."
80% of my neighborhood in 77077 has power but not me and the cluster or buildings around me.  Don't see any trucks nearby either.  Awesome.
im in 77450 im praying sm rn im sick of this bs
77494 - still no power (corner of kingsland blvd and cane island pkwy)
No power
I'm at 77043 kempwood and gessner and still nothing since the hurricane. I just moved to this neighborhood last year and it seems we are constantly the last to get power back. 
Same. I am SO frustrated I can barely focus. Across the street from me has power but our side and surrounding blocks don't.
Same 😣
Same
"I got an email at 7am saying “Crews are still working on repairs at or near MY ADDRESS”. Still no power (77459), left for a hotel."
"I got that message at 230am, and as of 835pm, still no power or updates"
"I got that email a few hours ago, still don’t have power"
Got it at 8:30 this morning - also got one saying they were performing repairs - still nothing.
I got that message and then I got a call saying to expect several days for power to come back on🤷🏾‍♂️
In the same boat.
"I’m on Spring Cypress/249, still nothing."
Cypresswood between Jones and Grant still no power.
NO WAY US TOO WE GOT ALL EXCITED😭
LOL this just happened to me as well. Saw the ceiling fan spin for a moment and then it went right out.
Prolly someone back feeding their generator
In 77095 myself. West side of the zip has had power for a couple of hours now. Soon as it came on I turned on my fans and passed out. Hope it comes soon!!
Did the lights eventually come on? We got an email from CenterPoint saying our power was restored.
Find one on the same grid as a hospital/fire station/elder care facility. I think there are a bunch around the Fire station on Washington.
San Simeon on Allen Pkwy…didn’t lose power during freeze or the past two storms…I believe it’s because the Federal Reserve building is close to it
skyhouse river oaks
Not a single repair truck stopped in this area.
I’m telling myself everyone is just rejoicing in ac and forgot about us
I got power back earlier today in acres homes. Fingers crossed they get to y’all soon too
"Can confirm 77088, haven’t seen any work besides some digging of wires go on. I got a feeling it won’t be back until Friday night :/"
Also 77092 - no lights in my neighborhood.  Just north of 43rd off Antoine.  Still haven’t seen a single damn truck either.
That's also where my mom is -- hopefully they'll be next!
This is super helpful!!! Thank you
Mine says tomorrow noon! I hope so!!
Nice! Hopefully ours next since the gasoline station nearby to our place is on just now! Hopefully this is it! 🙏
is it for your neighborhood?
Mine said end of day 7/14 and it powered up 4 hours ago. Map still shows blue. Don’t believe it.
I am also in that zip code .  I was hoping it would be back up by this weekend . I have a feeling this is going to turn into a 10 to 14 day situation with no power
What intersection are you near by
Argh did the give a reason? We are so close to TMC it’s frustrating driving home and driving to work with all the 4 way stops
Are there any trucks working on the pole that’s down over by N Braeswood and Main (from the Smithlands station side)? It was blocked off 2 days ago but no trucks in sight. I think it’s the source of our section.

"Dude, that sucks.  My mom lives in 77077 - Lakes of Parkway - and as of ~11pm last night we were in the dark too.  We caved and paid out the nose for a hotel room.

Hang in there!"
If it’s any consolation that map is wrong. We’re in 77077 and have neighbors showing green who have no power and others showing orange who never lost power. I think CP were hoping we’d be distracted by those pretty colors.
"Update: Power came back at around 2pm. Seems my griping about it here finally got them moving, even with the rain still going.


Here's hoping the rest of you get your power back soon."
"Cat 2 Ike had many homes without power for 3 to 4 weeks.  And those weren't in areas way out in the sticks either. So I'm thinking 2 to 3 weeks for this one, ballpark. It's hard to fathom but Centerpoint's ability to restore power has significantly degraded since Ike."
"77077 - Briar Forest and Dairy Ashford still no power. We're staying with a friend in 77079 - Memorial and Dairy Ashford - and they never lost power. 

Thunderstorm coming tho... so we shall see. 

glad you were able to find a place for you and your 4 legged friend!"
77077 near Westheimer and Woodland park drive has been on for a couple of days
"Yeah on that note we’re out in Beaumont and there’s several available, pet-friendly hotels here"
Centerpoint only updates their lame map about 1-3 times per day.
"Same. When back out after about 20 minutes of rain, ridiculous!"
same zipcode but by west rd and beltway 8
A lot of stop lights around there that previously were working are currently out so it’s a traffic mess.
Do you mind sharing which street are you in? I received a message saying my internet turn on and when I came home nothing
Im 3 streets down. Still waiting 🥹 theres hope
What streets?  I’m in Cypress Station near Cypress Trace
You should call or use their online form to re-report that your address still has an outage.
"same, though i am closer to southwest freeway (accross the street from houston baptist), really really frustrating :("
I’m in the same area. This x100. Today I have seen work trucks across the street from CM in the Walgreens parking lot and in the nearby neighborhood but honestly it kind of looked like they were still in investigation mode which is so frustrating
Which area?
10.4 Yeehaw
They also told me that but we just got power. Map is useless and made up
Can confirm map is made up - my restoration date is two days from now and I currently have power
"Thank you guys, hopefully we get our power back soon. Been staying at a family friends house for almost a week now and I can't help but feel awkward on how we are just intruding in their space."
"FWIW, I’m in that situation and I got an automated message from CenterPoint saying they estimate Monday for me. Not sure how much I believe that, but it’s better than knowing nothing.

If you haven’t already it may be worthwhile to call to report the outage and ask for an update. I doubt you’ll get any useful info, but it may let them know there’s a problem if they don’t know already."
I am in 77004 too. MacGregor way. Ughghghggghh. No power.
Agreed it's definitely tedious to have to read power updates in 2 threads
Yeah Centerpoint actually did ok. I drove around and there was no real damage to the poles and lines. The post derecho work clearly made things more robust. Could it be better? sure we could bite the bullet and issue a $10b bond to bury the grid in the city of Houston limits at least. But at least there was some improvement on the actual engineering side. The comms on the other hand …. yikes.
This isn't a US problem - it's a Texas > ERCOT > Centerpoint problem. Texas has a grid that is sectioned off from the rest of the country. ERCOT is appointed by our state government to regulate a monopoly like Centerpoint. Centerpoint gets to do what they want cause they tell ERCOT what to do via the politicians and lobbying.
"This isn't a country problem. This is a state problem. Centrepoint are just going to maximize their returns within the regulations dictated by the city and by Austin. Their counterparts in other states have to do the same. As a state we've decided that a cheap grid that goes down occasionally is better than an expensive one that might go down one in 20 years. If the state required all grids in areas over a certain population density to be buried that Centerpoint would have to do that. We'd all likely pay for it via property taxes and/or higher retail rates. Personally, I'm ok with 2x power bills if it means a hardened buried power grid. I'm not sure there would be the same support for it more broadly."
"Yep. I’m in 77091. Near Tidwell and TX Jester. All of my neighbors are either elderly (two houses to the left) or have very small kids or babies (me, across the street, neighbor to the right). This is fucking appalling"
"It’s literally a joke at this point - they said they want a million people restored by Wednesday night, and they have only got about 125,000 people today that I can distinguish from their own numbers 

What a total joke, they would have to do 500,000 customers today just to be on target and their nowhere close"
It’s probably just that the easy fixes got done quicker and the longer ones aren’t done yet.
It’s because most of the time it is protocol to call the crews at least 2 days in advance and to call slightly more than needed. There’s formulas. Formula was not applied in same way since model had it hitting corpus and then as the model changed right before it hit no one really anticipated or responded for about a day during the changing conditions. Hence crews being called as the storm was happening.
"My apartment has been without power since Monday. I’m lucky enough that I have somewhere to go in the meantime, but there are so many that are less fortunate than me. This is unacceptable, and there will be answers for this, or there will be consequences."
"120 hours of no power… map says energized so it must be real, right? 🙄"
im in a complex in 77096. Where are u? Im near N.Braeswood & Fondren and its 5 trucks out here.
Maybe a breaker tripped in the complex
I’m in 77044 at Castle Run Dr and English Mist Dr still no power.
I live in the same area! No electricity yet
Do you have the link on where you can see specifically what area on the map or zip code?
"This is my intersection -- any updates? I'm away right now, but this morning Westheimer in this area was a bit of a mess."
Same zip.  Haven’t had power since around 8:30 this morning
"Yep. Houses in my neighborhood have power, just not my street..."
Honestly I'd be pretty excited if I knew I'd have power even tomorrow
Sigh .. 77024 is always one of the last.
"i’m 77057, thanks for the update! i’ve been looking for one for so long bc i left to katy to stay at my friend’s but still haven’t received any updates"
The service has been unreliable/down for most people for the previous three months lol. Joke of a company
I'm not sure if my mid rise is the only one without complete power I think my neighbors have power and I don't hear generators.
"A little south of I10 and Voss here. Drove around for an hour, every business, strip center and restaurant has power but the houses / condo's near me (including me) don't. Are commercial businesses on some sort of separate grid? This sucks"
What is open?
"I'm still no power in that area (townhome just south of Grey), I think the trees are the culprit and it's block by block outages."
"Sometimes it's automatic safety switches trying to reset themselves, and having to turn off again because there were still problems somewhere along the power lines leading to your house. Other times it's the linemen testing to see if they're done fixing things on that set of lines, and then realizing nope, there's still a fault somewhere else that they have to track down."
where are you in that zip?
I’m 77006 near boheme and still no power. Went out at 1020 yesterday:(
"Which part if you don't mind me asking? I live near the intersection of Fannin and Oakdale (Venue Museum District), at work so not sure if ours might be back too"
Had power all day yesterday in 77004 and today it went out.
Yeah I expect my place in 77008 to be the same. I saw the explosion from behind our house. Our little block is dark compared to all of the lights around us.
When did it come back?
Norhill?
"The notification system seems to be overwhelmed this time. A few people have reported getting messages from Centerpoint about this outage, but many have not. They're still working on repairs even if they can't manage to tell you specifics, though."
"I’ve gotten a few nothing-burger phone call updates that just said   “We’re working on it,” but no texts, which are the ones I’m actually signed up for."
"Power flickered for half a second at about 4pm, so fingers crossed they are actively working on our area. Will update if/when it comes back on and stays on."
Over in champions still no power
Borderline 77069/77070 (249 & Grant area) and still no power since about 6 or 7am yesterday
77069 checking in no power since 7AM yesterday
Just need the sterling to come back online but center points incompetence is magnified by the building staffs incompetence
"I keep getting the same message, except they don’t even state the zip code lol (mine is 77004). No clue if it means anything"
So far it hasn't meant anything. Got one for my area around 8:30 this morning. Seen nothing. They also sent one saying they were performing repairs /shrug
Starting to think it’s just a mass message sent to everyone.
Awesome! Is cell signal strong there too? We have tmobile and it dropped this morning.
Following
77070 here near Jones Rd and 1960. No power
I think vintage park or Whole Foods plaza is good with power
Oh praise the Lord! Hoping 77003 is back up soon
Some of the buildings are still without power 😬
"Is your power still on? I live in that complex as well but I went up to Austin after the hurricane, I need to head back tonight but don’t want to if we have no power still. I looked on the centerpoint outage map and it shows our whole complex doesn’t have power."
We are still out. 
It’s getting worse now super tired and hot 🥵 
Still out?
"My in laws are in Vicksburg. Nothing on there either. Drove down into Sienna and the HEB center had power and was open, but pretty much all of Sienna is dark."
What sucks is half the neighborhood has power the other half hasn’t been restored.
Same here.
I think green means more local issue not no power
77006 by black hole coffee shop and still nothing here. Went out at 6:30 on Monday morning so we’re on hour 51 already.
I don’t it’s being refreshed
What does the blue mean?
"So green is good, but is blue better or worse than orange?"
[deleted]
"Centerpoint is only updating that map a couple times a day, it seems. It hasn't been updated since some time yesterday afternoon."
"your weatherhead (the pole that runs from the electrical lines to your roof) may be damaged

check the breaker box and meter to see if you need to flip it back on, or if you're receiving power"
what road ? 
Hope that covers near FB tollway and Lake Olympia. Thanks for the update.
77006 by black hole and still no power but heard black hole got power back
That’s reassuring! Also in 77006 near rudyards and on the coverage map it just has our area orange and under assessment. Was yours also showing that? Or was it marked blue?
I know some one who lives next to Sinclair. Still no power.
Was near there checking on my place an hour ago near TC and Bevis…still no power
"I live near that area (closer to 13th) and have been checking in once a day, will let you know if we see anything! As of 40 minutes ago still no power for us."
[deleted]
Are you far off from Velvet Taco and SOMA sushi? 
"77007 - TC Jester and Larkin. Many houses with power but ours and a few neighbours are out.

Had to leave the house and thankfully have a place to go in Katy with power and AC."
77007 - washington and houston ave. still no power
Still no power to my neighborhood! The people around us have had power since Tuesday.
"I’ve been seeing south of the Bayou 77096 get power back, we’re north of it but hoping they make their way here soon 🥺"
Hopefully they're working their way through the rest of 77096 as well..
"77096- CS: S Braeswood & Chimney Rock, behind Subway & BBQ restaurant shopping center- Still no power 🫠"
Please report back if you can
In Townewest?!?
took it from 77407 (old orchard) 😫
"Several people in 77077 have reported good news this evening:

Somebody hear my prayers lawd
Thanks for the update! It looked like the intersection itself & the shopping center had power when I left for work this morning at 6:45 but nothing beyond that. 1960 from at least there to 249 - all traffic lights seemed to be working.
"my parents are in the 070 --- I think this storm did a number on the old pines in that area.  Oof,"
Congrats! Have a cold beverage of your choice for me!
Where in 77379 if you don’t mind me asking? Trying to figure out if my place has it again
Whereabouts street wise 🤞
Happened for us as well. We were a chunk of green surrounded by blue (but didn't have power of course). Now we are a chunk of blue (with no estimated restoration timeline) surrounded by green.
Maybe at least now they will show up!
"Just got back to my house in Meadowcreek. No power. No one nearby does either (can tell by the lack of outside ac units running).

I got my hopes way too up."
"Where at ? I’m cypresswood and stuebner airline but not at home, checking my ring cam but wondering if that’s not a good indicator for power being back on."
That's what I like to hear!
Could you give a general direction? Trying to figure out if my part of 77379 is completely fucked or not 😭
Same 😞
"I'm over here too. I just tell myself it'll be in when it'll be on. I don't trust that map. I feel like we have a chance for tomorrow, maybe even overnight. I have seen the trucks out working in numbers finally. At least we have a half ass date. "
Which area? Same zip no power
Ooooh cross streets?
We’re off Chimney Rock & S Braeswood. CP map has us back up on Wednesday…. Who knows at this point.
"Where exactly in that area? I went to the Randall's and CVS over there earlier, took some the neighborhood roads instead of Champion Forest, and lights were on all the way to Hollister and down to Richey. This is all south of 1960, I didn't go north. "
Did yall just get power an hour ago?
77057 CONGRATULATIONS!!!!
[deleted]
Did yours come back on yet?
Can you share cross street? I’m at 26th & Durham but don’t want to go all the way home to be disappointed again
same. Wondering how extensive this is considering it’s not raining or windy
same >:(
! can i ask how you learned that it was for local power repair? the lack of official communication has been eating at me 
77095 as well... Starting to put tally marks on the wall at this point.
"Yep, right next to the 12,000 linemen"
I’m sure they are using the best duct tape they can get so this never happens again.
"Considering that speed is their main priority (as long as it IS taking), I can promise you they are doing the bare minimum to get things running again.

Doing it the proper, resilient way would require planning and time"
"I read this power outage is a record, even beating hurricane Ike. Crazy!"
"Same about no power in Alief here. Always feels like there’s no urgency to fix infrastructure problems for us over here, and then when they do it’s done in the most non-sensical and inconvenient way."
what part of 77004?
"Hi, what area do you live in? I am also in 77025 but no power "
"It's a generic message they've been gradually sending to everyone, they started sending it out yesterday."
"Same message. It’s just generic bullshit. They’re basically pretending to keep you updated while saying “wait longer peasants, we’ll finish when we finish”."
I’m nowhere near you and got the same message. It’s generic bs to say they are in communication with customers 
"Well I guess 77082 is in the bottom of the list. Theres shit everywhere. Trees on Power lines, floors etc. I think I saw a human"
"Well I guess 77082 is in the bottom of the list. Theres shit everywhere. Trees on Power lines, floors etc. I think I saw a human"
I’ve given up on 77040 and seeking shelter outside of the city. I can usual wait it out but something tells me this is going to be Ike levels bad since we’re always last to get restored.
"There is a downed post on little York, between Bingle and langfield"
So it will not be up by end of day??
"That is correct customer. There is absolutely, absoutely, nothing you can do about it. -CenterPoint"
Do you know if houses by tio trompo have power as well?  This is so close to us! Plsss Oprah winfrey
😭 I’m in 77007 near that intersection and I still don’t have power
Do yall have Wi-Fi?! Hoping we got power back but not WiFi 😅
"Literally saaaaammmme. I’m starting to get SO mad. It said power by the end of today, now we’re green on the map showing energized and every street surrounding us has power but we don’t. I’m so done"
Same here. 10 houses no end in sight.
I hope so. We're one of the few who got left behind while our community received theirs
"the phone lines are VERY congested rn. tried calling earlier and they had to have disclaimers like ""We have very high call volumes right now so wait times are longer than usual."""
Also 77062 with no power.  The entire neighborhood looks dark.
"Use the breaker to disconnect load, flip engine off switch.  Don't just unplug cables, arcing will damage sockets.

To start, keep breaker open, start engine, wait 15sec to get to speed, close output breaker"

"Am in the same area, pretty sure 3/4 of my complex has power. Of course I’m in the 1/4 without 🤦🏻‍♀️"
"yeah im in this area river oaks
no power in my building but two complexes next to me have power"
I’m in this area code too. We have water but no power. Another building in our complex has power but we don’t 😒
"same here, Crimson apartments 77027. Miserable."
Unless they're solar
What part of 77036? None over here close to corporate
"my complex has power on floors 26-40, the lobby and the 9th floor common area but floors 10-25 (where i reside)??? nothing."
So you know if the power will be on today in our area 77096
"Woohoo! I’m 77581 but Lakes at Highland Glen, nothing here - it’s getting 80F in the house with humidity so I’m grabbing the cats and hurrying to my sister’s in Clear Lake that got power back this morning. Hoping it comes back soon 😮‍💨"
Since what time?
"My mom is in 77396. She has a generator, but her cell service is pretty much out (she can text me and that is about it) and internet is out."
Do you have good cell service?
I live in 77459 I'll let you know when anything changes 
still down as of this morning is what I heard from family
"Nothing, no power... But we still have have water"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/s/N9pDjFF7uh

This thread might be helpful! I also added some links to the original post. Stay safe out there!

I have a reliable way to charge my phone now so I'm posting links where I can

I'm sorry I can't say as much about your specific zip code, though."
"hi neighbor, no power either since 8 AM yesterday, pretty new to the area so idk how long it takes for us to get power back"
Good to know
No hope in getting anything tonight either. Been out since 3am Monday morning!
Do you live in a high rise in that area by any chance??
What part of 77009?
"I think it can take up to half an hour for the status to sync up. Or they might only be turning your power back on temporarily and it will go back off again soon when they realize they need to make more repairs on that segment, that's happened to some people."
2 hours ago I got power back. I'm located by Airline and 610 behind the farmers market
I'm in the same zip code so that's hopeful
"Just down the street from there, hopefully we’re soon!"
Bevis&24th and 25th has power back!
"It seems like Yale and 24th and 25th have power, but not the streets south of it."
"Drove by the house and around Yale/Heights. No power N of 11th E of Yale. Didnt see any crews but given the wide area out they might be working at the source. On the plus side didnt see much evidence of widespread damage to poles and lines. Power mostly never went out south of 11th, particularly west of Yale. Based on the people getting power back West of us and N of us, I’d say they’re working towards us."
Nope. 11th and TC Jester still down.
My dad's came back on in 77095 last night. Just got here after the gym and it turned off a minute ago. Praying it's because they are turning mine on a few streets over but doubtful.
Where at in 77006?
"You gotta expand your mind man, is power even real? What is light really? I’d trust the professionals on this."
"They fixed a problem that was affecting a larger area, but now there's still another problem affecting a smaller portion of that area, which includes you. The status should sync back up with reality within half an hour or so."
That Power On is *supposed* to be your smart meter.
Where did you see that power was back on? I can’t see a way to view that info on my account.
Bumping for visibility and answers. Also hi neighbor
No power just pain and hope
I got an automated call from Centerpoint saying to expect to be without power for several days
Is there power to Forum Park yet? The Whataburger app says the one on Bissonnet is alive today.
You celebrated too loudly
"Lucky, 77498 too, area behind the Home Depot on hwy 6, still no power since yesterday at 5 AM 😭"
"77389 drove down spring-steubner and the Dutch Bros, Kroger, Torchys, 7-11 etc all seem to have come back to life... had me real optimistic for the subdivision but nope :/ house/neighborhood is still without"
77388 Rhodes and 2920 nothing yet
77379 also a no for my in laws
"77373, nope"
"77069
Nope"
what part of 77063?
"Where about? My parents are within that ZIP code and been without power. 

Thanks in advance! "
"Not sure if it means anything, but I got an automated phone call from CenterPoint 10 min prior saying to prepare to be without power for a few days."
Where in 77095?
Omg!! Is this north or south of i-10?
I got an automated message about my area that said “several days” but glitched out heavily when it said that. It repeated the message when staying on the line but omitted the time frame after the first time so idk.
Oh no i live in the 77021 area code and have been staying with a coworker!
And GME IS OPEN lol 😂 GAMESTOP IS OPEN I REPEAT GAMESTOP IS OPEN. So is the uh.. liquor store!
Anyone know if 77373 near Aldine Westfield Rd have power yet? At work and want to come home to AC dammit
"They already are, in some areas. Centerpoint isn't sharing that much details with anyone. If you live in a neighborhood with underground lines, or if you have overhead lines but don't see any trees down on lines in your vicinity, you will probably get power back sooner than otherwise."
Sterling??
Thats a good sign. After the derecho the traffic lights coming back up Yale and Heights were generally a good leading indicator of the neighborhood restoration. I recall getting my power back \~5 hours after posting here that the lights and businesses on Heights and 11th were back on. They turn the circuit back on and anything that can receive power does. Stuff still out on the circuit then gets fixed at a more local level. Usually it just means resetting a transformer but sometimes it means repairs at a specific location.
">  I saw some traffic lights that were dead last night back on again, on/near Chimney Rock and US 90. Don’t know if that means anything.

Yes, it means the nearby buildings should have power again now/soon."
77070 near Jones Rd/Woodedge and we finally got power about 2 hours ago. I was so happy to hear my fan suddenly turn on and everyone in my house yelled out a celebratory “YES!!!!”.
77070 centerpoint still says my meter is off but this gives me hope
That’s a generic email they blasted out to everyone.
This area has been neglected 3 times in the past 2 months. We’ve lost power in this zip code and are one of the last people to get it back. It’s fucking ridiculous.
"Your residence may or may not still need work on smaller nearby issues, but it sounds like that big repair should get some more people's power restored, yeah."
"i saw a centerpoint truck in springbrook, maybe good sign?"
"make sure to always connect your electronics to an outlet with a circuit breaker, u can get one from microcenter for like $10, don't connect them straight to the wall outlet."
"Oh dang
I’m not far over by sunny ridge
and we got it about 1:30pm today, but there is also 1 street in our neighborhood still without
It’s getting closer

Hang tight they getting closer"
No. I got power back 30 hours ago and it still says power off. Think their systems are still bad.
Oh this is encouraging! I’m just a couple of blocks north west😬😬😬 hurry up centerpoint
Pretty sure those dumbasses can’t even provide updates on their website correctly. I’m not getting anything either
Update: they fixed it but it doesn’t give us any more information then what we had to begin with. They just changed those pointless colors from orange to majority of the map showing blue/green now😑😒
Ty
"Nope :( Our area just feels so much more dead and deserted compared to when we drive out to Bellaire and West U, etc."
I JUST got it back! The truck was on the street as we were pulling up to pack more and head to the next airbnb. W. Bellfort and Willowbend.
I'm close to Godwin Park and still nothing. Our neighbor saw a truck and talked to the lineman and he said they were working on the assessment for our area.
The map says the assessment is complete in my area (chimney rock and north Braeswood)
Where can I see the map
"Got the email from CNP as well, saying the same thing, but “Please know restorations will be happening daily and you may be restored earlier.” 🎉🥳👏🏼"
May or may not have an update for your address https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195bcf03ae0c491f9f14bf77f2c43420
"Parts have power, I don’t 😭 the Walmart and Ross and Michaels and all that off 45/louetta have power, as well as the shopping center with Adriatic cafe (Cypresswood/45). Some of old town spring as well has power."
"I commute around old town spring off Riley Fuzzel and Aldine westfield street light is up but it could be a generator since the Shell off that corner has no power. Lexington Woods subdivision has tree limbs and debris everywhere! Tuesday a major tree fell on the back road going to Pruitt Park near Winship, clear now but I guess this area has ALOT to clear. I hear folks off Cypresswood Lake near walmart have their power back but there is far less vegetation."
Powers back down unfortunately 
I heard it’s spotty. Some people at the mandolin have power. Lights back up at the McDonald’s and at matzke park. Could be coming to us soon?
"Half of lakewood has power, and it's like they abandoned the other half. Wtf"
Wonderful news
Do you know if Nasa Pkwy is up near Wellby financial?
Where have you heard this from?
What cross streets?
"Yeah, a competent public utility could at least tell us where we were in line. That stupid MS Paint map they put out still says I have to wait for further info."
Amazing! Do you provide this service to other zip codes? I know a few people who'd be interested
This has been 77586 (Seabrook) since they put up the map on Tuesday. Some of the city got power yesterday but of course we’re in the part without. Even though some got power yesterday the map still shows them in Blue. That map is for Centerpoint to say “you asked for a map and we delivered” 😒
"My mom texted me yesterday that she saw a bunch of utility trucks near Dulles middle school. Haven’t heard anything today

EDIT: she has power! Highway six near Austin parkway"
[deleted]
I am also in a non-electrified bubble in 77006. It seems like everyone has power around me but three houses. It sucks :(
"I am also in a 77006 with no power, was told no crew dispatched and no estimate.  Given it is only a 10 customer block it is going to be days."
"77006 bubble solidarity, Commonwealth and Nevada"
A Cat 1! It just goes to show you what happens when they intentionally let the infrastructure collapse for the sake of their profits! 💰💰
I don't think you can trust the new Centerpoint map. My power came back on before dawn early Wednesday morning. The map still shows I have no power.
I think we're officially screwed. But we would need to rely on centerpoint communications for any answers...
Anything on lake field by the HEB on Austin PKWY?
Anyone notice they changed 77098 to green but I still don't have power off Buffalo Speedway near Richmond....
77098- Us too 😞
"Oooh, what cross streets?"
Same. ☹️
Rockridge! Rockridge! Splendid! Splendid!
"If the rest of your home has power but the router ""isn't turning on at all"", no lights on it, it's probably fried and will need to be replaced. Coax cable/outlet/service issues wouldn't prevent the router from powering on."
What street?
This is the Riverstone area - Shady River
I'm in a nearby neighborhood and still nothing. Please be next....
"They may, but it’s almost certainly at reduced capacity. This log someone put together of the outage tracker numbers shows consistent, significant slow down for restorations overnight.

There also isn’t a sudden jump after the slow down, which makes it seem like it’s genuinely slower and not just a delay in reporting."
Memorial northwest lines still down and untouched since Monday
How were you able to get a hold of someone at Centerpoint?  What number did you call?  I have had no luck for 5 days.  Thanks in advance!
East or west? Zip code?
"I’ve seen you on here posting, congrats!"
Hahaha they turned my power for 1 second and shut it off again and now my restoration date is pushed to tomorrow 🫠
"Checking in, looks like we got power off of Bammel & S Trace. Did you guys get it back yet? Fingers crossed for us 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼 (I’m not at home currently)"
"My internet (AT&T fiber) has been up all the way through.

We still have Xfinity for TV and it has been out the whole time.

Fortunately I have a couple of streaming devices and a DVR and am able to record over-the-air TV.  

I was going to eliminate Xfinity when I got AT&T but the lady of the house enjoys the Xfinity DVR and does not want to learn to use a new setup.  

Anyway, I bet a lot of Xfinity people don't have TV or internet and a lot of AT&T people do.

Most will find if you can power a modem (via generator or battery back up) you'll have internet even when grid power is down."
"I am dying here. I have never seen such a cluster in my life. I moved to Kingwood from Buffalo on 7/4. I wasn’t here even a week before this happened. I’m so mad right now. I’m getting a hotel room if you need a cool place q me and my kids. I don’t even care that I don’t know you, just be nice to me im fragile atm lol"
Kangwood West is done
Did you do anything like reporting or calling? Trying to see what people did during their nested outage since I'm currently in one too
"Same zip, they restored 1/3 building in my complex then left. I’m losing my fucking mind."
"its about an hr or so to change it out, finding a crew is gonna be the hard part"
That's the problem with our power too. CP told us it was a transformer only affecting 9 homes. They estimated that we would get our power back Friday the 19th
Mistakes with repair times and stuff are bound to happen but it's hard not to feel intentionally lied to when they are blatantly lying about so many other things
"Like, it would be nice if Centerpoint wasn’t working AGAINST you"
Supposed to be 24/7 but they aint doin shit 
Yay!
"Some reasons why this storm was bad: 1. abbot was out of town which yes will slow things because normally he’s in command and while Patrick can, it’s not his juice. 2. The disaster management folks were already tired and miffed from Mr. Derecho who was damaging and unexpected. Frankly they were just getting ready to rest and this was the last thing anyone wanted to deal with so everyone got caught flat footed. 3. The storm did originally track more west over corpo. It did start to drift east, fast, and CenterPoint was about 24 hours behind in officially changing their internal projections about where and what they thought the impact would be. What happened was more or less a worse case scenario for a cat 1 direct hit with the dirty side smathering the city for hours. They didn’t start calling other crews until as the storm was over the city and there were assessing the damage in real time as the grid snapped into twigs during the first four hours. A low to medium impact west of the city turned into a direct, prolonged encounter."
77073 my neighborhood has power except for 16 houses. Guess who is one of those 16. Right off of airtex
Samesies… at this point their map is a hoax for the or backlash
Same for my neighborhood and my son has had power (Manvel) since Wednesday night but shows no power 🤪
"Not far from you, Champions Point Village off Hollister near Bourgeois.  Corner store has power, people across Hollister from us have power.  No major poles down, no trees across wires.

Add to that, Xfinity internet/cable TV has been out the whole time too."
where in 77095😭😭
In 77095 too. We had power for a couple hours earlier but it’s been out for 3 hours now.
where in 77095😭😭
I feel like 77338 has made no progress. My house is out of power
"Same.
 I'm by 1960 and Foxwood near the airport too what is going on?"
"Same here, 77063 and still nothing. "
Welcome to the realm of Nested Outage
"We're in Garden Oaks, nothing here yet :("
Back on around 12:15 pm Tuesday
nothing near fry rd and 529
Same! Im in a apt complex. Idk if Centerpoint is our service provider. We pay utilties thru a service our apts provide.
Can you post a link to that spreadsheet?
"Was looking for this. I had to dip and find shelter, lol. I can't sleep in a hot room. Luckily, my sister has power at her apartment near Richmond and Gessner."
77478 still out for me too. Xfinity Internet has been down since yesterday afternoon too. Fun!
Not running
"Some lines started at 8am, but there will be delays. I can’t find anything showing real times so far. Only scheduled, which means nothing this close to 8."
I'm nearby there off barker. Still no power.  Hopefully we will be next. Last time we were one of the last ones to get power back.
I’m on the Grand Mission side and got power. However my parents don’t have power. Everything from Beechnut to West Airport via Harlem looks like to not have power except HEB. Traffic lights are not working either.
"My mom is in Humble 77396, and she is still out."
You had power later than us. We are legit beside deerbrook and we haven't had power since between 5-6AM. Went to bathroom at 5 AM and there was power. Woke up at 6 am cause it was stuffy and eerie. My fan was off and as a southerner. That meant shit was serious lol.
Still waiting on my power to turn back on too. Any update?
"I'm in the same area in 77019, hoping with you."
The HEB off Northpark by 59 was open and fully functional when I went yesterday afternoon. I’m hoping they’re still open today. Getting gas somewhere is my main concern.
[deleted]
Not a single CNP vehicle in sight. We’re cooked!
People by mills branch got some power at around 6. Heb shopping center has power I think. We got a text from a business in there saying they were opening today. 339 had 4 trucks working along Woodland Hills for hours yesterday. Apparently it’s a mess
Also in third ward it’s so hot :(
"FWIW, the power came on at our house about 7:00 pm yesterday and has been on since. We’re near CLC Blvd and Space Center in the Pines part of Northfork. We walked around Northfork this morning and most of the main part of it still doesn’t have power."
Which neighborhood?
What part are you living in? I’m near exploration Greens and nothing yet.
"My office building in 77057 has power back, not sure about residential but I know that a lot of blocks in that area are getting power back relatively quickly at the moment. I'd expect power back in that area by tonight at the latest, might already have power back."
"77057 is restoring some power as we speak. the Westheimer/Voss area in particular is doing better, can't say for the full Galleria area"
"77057, in westhaven estates next to Briargrove still has no power. The area where Whole Foods is on Voss and San Felipe has power tho "
I got power back about 2 hours ago. I'm by Airline and 610 behind the Farmers Market
"Similar area, same situation. Haven’t seen a single Centerpoint truck yet in the area either"
We are just across Westheimer from you and have power!
77004 I had power all day yesterday aside from some very short blips without. Multiple transformers blew yesterday morning. Lost it at 8:30 AM this morning and just got it back about 10 min ago. I’m on the uncool side of Midtown for reference.
"My wife just checked in '04 and no power.  I saw Center point said they have 10 transmission lines down.  If that's the case, I see why they're hedging their bets on no big changes until Wednesday when they can get some of those restored.

One of my coworkers just told me she's decamping to Austin.  I think she's on to something."
i drove around for a while this morning and didn’t see any trucks :( 77004 near museums 
Power restored! 77004 near MacGregor/H-E-B
"I'm at the corner of W Gray and Waugh, and the west side of our complex has power as of an hour ago while the east side doesn't."
I am on waugh/allen pkwy … no power but just got an update from center point that they are currently working on fixing it in the area.
power was still out for the fourth ward/midtown segment when I left half an hour ago
Still no power in 77081? I live across from Walmart on S. Rice. They have power but could be a generator. Need to know lol
Currently they're working to restore fire stations/hospitals first 
What part? We’re still out unfortunately but you’re giving me hope!
"what part? My moms house is over near S Rice and Bellaire, she's staying here with us currently but I bet she'd love to be able to go home"
"We're at Newcastle and Lula st, and all of southdale has power! Hopefully you guys get it back soon!!"
Sometimes they have to turn off an adjacent line to safely repair something or clear a tree.
"If it ain’t broke, fix it until it is"
Where in 77019?
Is W Dallas back yet? 
Where in 77019? I'm across the street from Whole Foods on the south side and still out.
"the other mega-thread had a couple positive reports from 77057, one on Nantucket and the other on Potomac south of Inwood. My office building on Augusta confirmed they have power again"
"That's where I am, nothing yet."
Open the windows at least. 
im 77450 on mason and STILL nothing im losing my damn mind
Good luck I had a flicker too and it's been 4 hours since and still no power
I’m literally 1 mile away from there and still don’t have power…
What part of 77004 if you don’t mind?
Ok I'm 77004 but no power here yet. Jackson st and Anita near Baldwin park
It wasn't over on Southmore at Almeda when I was there last.  You know if that block has power now?
"We’re in the same boat off bagby and Tuam. Even got an email from centerpoint saying our power is on, but when we went to check they were wrong. No updates as of yet"
We just got power at 77006 just south of westheimer from you. Good luck!
Do you have power now?   Missouri and Waugh still no power since Monday am.
"i noticed this too, i guess they prioritized the businesses? or maybe they never lost power idk. Either way I hope we're next."
Saw two centerpoint trucks throught the area during the day. Some areas around are slowly regaining power. 
Not that part of the Heights. S of 11th looks pretty much all good E of Yale and neighborhoods N of us getting back rn. Hopefully means we are soon.
Near cleveland park. No power
Tc jester and Washington got power  few hours ago
Whereabouts? 77096 without power here!
"Studewood and 17th, no power no internet :("
What part?
I’m near Woodway and Voss. Really hope they get to us!!
"Yep, mine came on between 4 and 5pm. It did blink twice around 8pm."
"Lost it yesterday around 4pm and still down - 77459 in Sienna.
E: This is for xfinity. Power has been out since about 4am the morning of the storm."
Yep! Sure did! It JUST came back
"Yup. Entire Heights seems to be out.

Fuck these companies."
"Yes, just now"
"Yup, XXXXX and it jsut went out. Checked with my neighbors, it’s out for them too."
77006 Xfinity went out about 45 min ago
Mine is back
yep
Mine has been out since power came on at 6pm. Is yours still out? It's 10:45pm now.
77054 - Holly Hall no power still. But slightly better cell reception now.
"I drove around the area about an hour ago. Power seemed to be on almost everywhere besides Plaza and Ewing Apartments. Also, the light and gas station at the intersection of Hermann Dr and Almeda Rd were out. I didn’t see if Barnaby’s or Fadi’s were up yet but all the other restaurants like Bodega’s and Lucille’s and MF Sushi had lights on! Even a lot of the townhouses a block away seemed to have power, but I suppose they could have generators. 

I’m worried we’ve been pushed to the next round of repairs - didn’t see any trucks until getting closer to Wheeler."
"Same here, right by Hermann Park & still no power. Some of the apartment complexes just a few blocks down from me have had their power restored though, so there's still hope"
Got power yesterday late last night!
im 77450 on mason by creech elementary and i got my power back around 7pm tday !!! my wifi went out like an hour after tho and is still out BUT power still on
ok jk my wifi is back now
"where?

edit: i see on entergy map"
"There are some pockets of green in the Woodlands area now, but still a lot of work to be done. https://www.etrviewoutage.com/map?state=TX

In tonight's detailed Entergy update, they didn't even list an estimated date of completion for the Woodlands area (while all their other areas got a date), because of the substantial damage to transmission lines and substations in that area. https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/lcg88m0/"
Where?? Im by 249 on 77070 no light still :( 
Where at? I’m near 1960 and Jones rd and have been without power for 48 hours. Idk how much longer I can take this BS..  I hope power comes back on soon.
Where at??
"im near Meyer Park and have seen some out-of-state utility trucks tooling around, hoping for progress"
"Same as you, Centerpoint finally sent me a notice at 11am that ""crews are working at or near [us]"", not sure if this is worth anything for expecting power back imminently."
"Same as you, Centerpoint finally sent me a notice at 11am that ""crews are working at or near [us]"", not sure if this is worth anything for expecting power back imminently."
Whereabouts? I'm in the same zip and still got nothing.
"Also following for what area? Nottingham Country here, no power yet."
Which area????
What area? Can you give a neighborhood?
JK IT'S 10:51 PM AND WE STILL HAVE NO POWER 🙃🫠
"Excellent! The corner at HEB got it back yesterday by 5pm. And the Apts across the street. But none past that first 🚦 at s course, inc the light itself.. still off I assume bc I'm the very next complex. 77072."
"Long point and Campbell being told by the map we have power, however we do not. I think we are being gaslighted."
77045 south of you power just came on 10 minutes ago.
Whereee
I live in nottingham apartments. I am at a friends place. Do you know if its back there?
"There's some random guy deep in an internal office manually updating that lousy map, and it ignores/omits smaller outages. Just call the main Centerpoint outage reporting phone number, 713-207-2222, and make sure they still have an active outage recorded for your location."
"A state rep said on Facebook that Centerpoint is updating it at noon, 4 and 8.  
https://www.facebook.com/share/p/NR4WL77wErRi3iqb/"
They won’t give a fuck. Fuck them
"Not yet for me, 77003 near Harrisburg 🥲"
Still none here. Close to Brothers Tacos.
Nope :(
I have heard people reporting power coming back  for them in parts of 77479 . However havent been back from office yet myself to confirm. Awful times
Ohh comfortable sharing maybe cross streets? Family members live all around the stafford zip code 
WHAT ??? BEST NEWS
"Ohhhh man, I’m right across the hwy and nothing!  Hopefully it’s coming this way"
Happened to me the other day. It came back on for 2 hours and then went right back out.
77040 is just cursed at this point. Which sucks cause there is no major or even much minor damage in the entire area.
We literally left at 8 o’clock this evening because we couldn’t take the heat. I wonder if our house is on now too
Same
Cross street?
77091 is still out too. At least my part.
"Can confirm for anyone who think the linemen aren't working around the clock. Received the email of power restoration at 1:36 AM and got flashbanged in the middle of the night. 

Also want to note a couple of things for those that may be interested.
 
1.  My part of 77494 remained orange on the map the entire time leading up to the power restoration. 

2. Received only 2 emails through-out the 3 days (both yesterday 7/10). One generic ""this could take several days"" email, and one ""crew is still working at/near your location"". 

Maybe this can instill some hope in some people as I was losing hope myself, but feel very blessed right now."
77494 kingsland blvd and cane island pkwy - power still out
"77074 bellaire & tarnef
Someone commented in another post that there was a centerpoint truck yesterday at bellaire/hillcroft and was questioned about their lines by them, but still no power as of evening. I hope that's a sign that they are working on it in our area."
Got the same at 12:08. 100% they did it so they could have till EOD Friday.
They know exactly what they are doing. I just drove all around the area they claim to be working 24/7 to restore power with tons of workers. I saw ZERO electrical workers anywhere in the area. I went all around Beamer to 45 through Scarsdale all the way down and around Dixie farm from 45 to Pearland parkway and down parkland parkway. Not a single utility truck anywhere.
I got the email shortly after midnight & was wondering the same…
Who the FUCK thought that sending out an intentionally confusing email like this was a good idea??  May they burn in hell.
Driving past Ave E and Murphy: various trucks seen in the parking lot in Stafford Shopping Center.
"Very interested in this update. Unfortunately for our neighborhood (I'm near that library), I'm part of the blue area that has been assessed, but apparently the other blocks across the street are still yellow. I really don't get it - the tree damage wasn't awful around here. These shouldn't be complex fixes."
"just drove past the heb on gosling/2920, saw some centerpoint trucks and tree services working on a line! i live on spring stuebner hopefully we get power soon"
im on queenston and sheffield estates hopefully we got it too!
Derecho was a full week for me in 77022…
I’m in a similar boat to you. Light green/partially energized with no power to one side of the complex. The map has no ETA either which further frustrates us. We’ve called numerous times yesterday and today but I guess we’ll see when this gets fixed.
I'm in an area that's always been light green and never without power this time
I seem to be the only other person in the sub to report on that area. I went to check earlier and the only workers I saw were fixing the sidewalk across the street from the super food mart and pj's. No power unfortunately
"It’s on then. I used that for the storm in may. Kept checking and once it was on. I was headed home.

Only thing is, it’s a common occurrence for them to fix it and it go off again shortly after due to de-energizing the lines for problems down the line."
What are your cross streets?
"77057 This is so weird to me, I am near Woodway and Bering and got it back 2 nights ago. I hesitate to say that because I feel incredibly guilty. But I hope the information is useful. So hopeful they’re on their way to you fellow neighbor, keep holding on!!!"
"77057 Bering/San Felipe

Exactly how I feel

Neighboring apartments got power over 48hours ago"
Keeping an eye on this zip code
Same!
What cross streets?
What part of the zip are you in?
"I’m so close to there, maybe I’ll get some of that juice"
Dont say that 😭😭😭
Do you mind sharing which complex or streets are you in? I still have no power
Still waiting by Cypresswood and Aldine Westfield and we are in the green in comparison lol
Just checked back at spring crossing(77373) and we are still without power. Things are cleaner at Mercer park though so they are making progress it seems.
"Oh they finally added dates for all on the map!!

Except my section off 77373. Still awaiting further assessment"
Hoping the best for you dude! 
"The other side of the street from me came on the day after I did after the derecho; we're listed as same ""circuit."""
this is exactly what im afraid of
What are the closest cross streets?
I was surprised to see so much of quail valley and parts of bright water dark still
Called yesterday and got through.  Today they are “closed”
I was able to talk to someone in CP yesterday but this morning its been saying they are “closed”
Do they still have power???
"Happy for you guys, I’ve been seeing that zip code over and over on here lol. Ours isn’t back yet, but I’m so thankful our neighbors are getting theirs back! :)"
Map said july 17 for this area. Hoping this is good news for us since center point says eod next Wednesday for us in the same zip code ☹️
"It seems like the Heights has had a lot of activity today, so this is hopefully a good sign"
What do you mean backside of shoreacres? I grew up in la porte area.
Beechnut and Kirkwood
"Map says energized, but 77006 Commonwealth and Nevada still down."
Same😭
"Best of luck brother, seems like you guys are the last ones left in 77007"
"It’s on! 

The weird thing is I just now got a notification of a power issue affecting my address and a restoration date of 7/19.  Methinks their PAS system is a bit screwy. 

My power was restored at 8:45 PM. I watched a lineman replace a transformer."
Just had an email saying Friday 19th (Academy and Aberdeen)
Can I ask what streets you are near?
77379. We lost power for \~9 hours after having it for a day and a half.They may have taken part of the grid down to do extensive work.
Also note Centerpoint said my restoration date was July 19 so there is hope for all of you still in the dark
What road?
Us too! Except half our neighborhood is back. Super frustrating.
"Centerpointe did not stage trucks for this Hurricane. I read an article that they normally bring trucks from out of town prior to a Hurricane so they're ready to deploy. They didn't do that this time. 

I guess they felt like they could take a nap after the tornado.

It's disappointing because I felt like they did a really good job with the tornado response. I saw utility trucks driving up and down streets all the time. Now, I haven't seen but maybe one truck."
"I saw a centerpoint f150 yesterday in your neighborhood 2 people and a clipboard
📋"
"Also in 77006 but closer to Rudyards. I was driving around about an hour ago and saw a big truck blocking a part of Commonwealth that was doing something with the sewer. Large hose down in the manhole and they seemed to be sucking stuff up. I don’t know for sure obviously, but maybe they’re fixing the sewage problem you’re having!"
"There's no one else to go to. If you stop being a Centerpoint customer and you don't move, you're just going without electricity and living Amish-style."
"I feel you bro, I got maybe 1 more night in this heat before I go mad! Of all the time, it has to be summertime!"
same with losing my mind. started sobbing at target because i realized there wasn't anything i could buy to make this not completely fucking unbearable.
Hopefully you’re staying there until your power comes on - thankfully we are at families in town too I felt the aftermath of heat exhaustion all day when we got here. So grateful we are here I worry about others that are in this heat.
"lol, they screwed up their link. Instead of https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/about-us/news/1778 , it should've been https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/about-us/news/1778

Here's a copy of it:

CenterPoint Energy provides customer restoration update

​Houston — July 10, 2024 – CenterPoint Energy has restored more than 1 million of the 2.26 million customers impacted by Hurricane Beryl in the first 55 hours of its restoration efforts, and continues to focus on restoring customers without power. Based on its continued progress, the company expects to have an additional 400,000 customers restored by the end of the day on Friday, July 12 and an additional 350,000 customers restored by the end of the day on Sunday, July 14.

* Company achieves goal of restoring 1 million customers by end of the day today
* Additional 400,000 impacted customers expected to be restored by the end of the day on Friday, July 12; 350,000 more by the end of the day on Sunday, July 14
* More specific estimated restoration times for customers to begin tomorrow ​

CenterPoint's crews are nearing completion on damage assessment, with more than 8,500 miles of its circuits walked and thousands of miles flown across the Greater Houston area. Crews have identified extensive tree damage across the company's system. Trees across the Greater Houston area were particularly vulnerable due to three unusual years of weather, including significant freezes, drought and heavy rain this past spring. Downed trees and a significant amount of tree debris had a major impact on CenterPoint's distribution system of poles and wires. As crews see tree damage blocking circuits and causing outages, they have been removing it to quickly restore impacted customers.

“Our restoration progress so far reflects our continued commitment to deliver on our promises to our customers,"" said Lynnae Wilson, Senior Vice President, Electric Business. “We are fully focused on achieving our next restoration goals, while continuing to address the issues in the hardest-hit areas where there is major damage to our equipment and infrastructure.""​

With sustained near hurricane-force winds and higher gusts as it moved well inland, Hurricane Beryl caused significant structural damage in some areas, including along the coast where parts of the electric system will need to be rebuilt. There was also major damage away from the coast related to the density of Houston and the electric infrastructure that serves it. Parts of these areas are also expected to experience prolonged outages. CenterPoint understands how important it is for customers to be able to plan around their outages, so more specific estimated restoration times will be available tomorrow.

CenterPoint's electric customers are encouraged to enroll in Power Alert Service® to receive outage details and community-specific restoration updates as they become available. For information and updates, follow @CenterPoint for updates during inclement weather events."
Yay! What part?
[deleted]
which area do u live？
🎊
"How good of a ""friend""?"
go over there and see...u never know.
This intersection is still without power
Power at this intersection is back on as of yesterday around 5:44 p
"I have this theory too. Had power come on, storm took it out during the day. Then in the afternoon it comes on, stays on for like 25min or so, and then goes out. Been out of power since. This feels like they’re being told to shut it off to “preserve” power…"
Yes! I lost it early am today and got it back mid afternoon! I lost it for 5 days in the derecho wind ordeal so I’m feeling so badly for those having to go more than 24 hours. Hopefully soon 🙃
I got it back at 7pm but it went out again at 9pm. Which makes no sense to me. Street next to mine has power but my street is all out.
"I briefly lost power a few times, maybe ten minutes each time about 3,4 times. I bet that they counted my house as “restored” even though I’m fairly certain they didn’t physically do anything. "
Annoys me so much that we got power in 77095 for an hour and somehow lost it last night
"Are you close to 610 ramp, I'm close to Tampico on Irvington and still no power."
I’m in 77057!!! Hope mine restores soon
any updates? does anyone know anything around Augusta & Westheimer?
Harvey wasn't a problem (electricity wise) for the Houston area because it was mainly nonstop rain by the time it got to us.
What is the number to text them?
Text them at what number?
In 77388 myself. It's been brutal.
UT housing area looks still dark....;;;
"Got the same message yesterday. I think it’s just sent out everywhere so they don’t have to be “reliable” in fixing an area in a certain amount of time.

A lot easier to say “Oh we’ll have the power up in 2 weeks”. Like no shit."
"Yes, a generic message cycling through everyone"
Boilerplate email. I got power back yesterday and got that in the afternoon.
"In press conference they were asked about ‘the other 1M’ and answer was 400k by Friday, 300K by Sunday, ‘next question.’  Aren’t big projects supposed to go faster once the ball is rolling and the initial kinks worked out??"
"Just looked at the site, it’s getting worse every time."
Because more than a million people still have no power. And even center point admit they could only “restore” power for 2/3 of them by the end of this week.
"Where in the area, if you don't mind?"
My modem is showing back online now. Anything on your end?
"77077 near 6 and Piping Rock. Still no power since Sunday. Many trucks righting poles on 6 between Westheimer and I-10, and businesses are on.  It’s probably the thing where they fix the big line and breakers get tripped on the much larger number of smaller ones. 

We moved here 2 years ago and are native Texans. We’re glad we are here. This is a strong and caring community.  

I have never seen the state lege this level of corrupt and hateful and so willing to abandon Texans who need help. It’s appallingly clear that Abbott hates Houston in particular.  There’s no way I’m leaving my beloved state to these crooks and I can’t wait to vote."
"Right next to you, not having issues with water, but no power. New CPE map shows us without an expectation of when we will get power up, so can’t tell if we should be expecting it will be later than July 19 or what. Unbelievable."
"Same here friend, any update?"
"Hall my complex has power,  my half does not.  So frustrating"
"We had gotten power back around 1pm, got a big surge around 10pm, and now some but not all of our lights work, and AC is out. Hopefully means they’re working on lines for area."
"bowen RO down since 5am monday
still no sign of power"
77063 here at Westpark and Gessner. Still no power but this gives me hope!
House or apartment?
"Thankfully I didn’t lose power till 7, but still without as well.  At least centerpoint finally sent an email saying they are aware of my power outage 🥴"
Same. Anyone see any centerpoint people out in our area?
"Nope, been out since 530am. We usually get it back on sooner than others. That’s how I know this is going to be a doozy."
My parents house in Bear Branch has been dark since Monday morning. Still offline AFAIK
"It’s wild how this all works, I’m like 2 blocks away and no power anywhere on my street."
"Saw that too, it's not that much closer but hopefully 77075 good news soon. I low some people around gulfgate had power earlier"
Have family in 77003 with no power. When I saw East End got power I got my hopes up 😂
"Also 77354, also no power all day."
"Also 77084, do NOT have it back yet (congrats tho)"
Is it still without power? Left my house to charge my phone at Target
What area? I’m near doss park and the RV resort. Left around 7 am to find ac and charge up.
Apparently there’s a tree down on the Louetta substation. Fuck knows when that’s getting fixed
Do you know about Brook Forest?

"77011 more than 24 hours here, no water still."
Been looking for a 77023. Here we go.
Centerpoint rep was on the radio on Houston Public Media earlier today saying that just because you have a critical alert doesn’t mean they can guarantee anything. This is the same rep that couldn’t provide any information regarding why they didn’t appropriately state resources.
What is your intersection if you don't mind me asking. I am also 77056 and still no power
Where
"can't find a reliable answer online but i would boil it if you can, just to be safe"
I haven't gotten/seen any boil water advisories.
I noticed lack of pressure yesterday as well but came back after a couple hours. Did not see a boil water advisory though. Is 77459 back on? Currently out of town🙃
[deleted]
Does that mean the power on 77090 will be restored soon? 🥲
I got power back about 30 mins ago
Unplug / turn off anything you can that you didn't already. That flickering can damage stuff.
Where in 77040 if possible.
What part of 77040? I’m about 15 minutes from there hoping it comes back soon.
77057 here power has not been restored
Where in 77057? TIA!
"Parts of 77057 around Westheimer have power, but I think most still do not"
My parents live down there. They said they're still without power.
Hi I'm currently at work. Do you know if the apartments off South Loop West have lights?
I heard power back. Across from 2nd Baptist Church
I'm at Fry & Kingsland but in 77450 and there was a flicker about ten minutes ago
"I’m in 77389, still nothing for me"
"I’m there. Just a gut feeling, but I don’t have high hopes for this area"
What cross street! I’m the same zip!
I'm in Southcreek and my street is still out 😭
"Where in Southcreek? I’m in Austin, right now (escaping the heat). I’m near Queenston. During the derecho we (in my area of Southcreek) got our power back in two days, but other parts of Southcreek, it took like 5 days."
The Taco Bell on Shepherd at San Felipe has power; drive through is open but the lobby is closed.
77070 no power here.
"77379, Spring seems well and truly fucked atm. Never gone this long without power (37 hours), which makes me think something big is holding up repairs beyond just how far-reaching the outages were"
I know someone in 77386 that has power
Where exactly?
Dam my friend said half of the neighborhood in 77067 still don’t have power also 77069 still no oower
"If you can, drive to Antoine and 249, perfect cell service and internet."
If it makes you feel any better the map isn’t accurate at all. Several places marked on the map in my area show up as orange but have power.
Which map are you using
"I have family on that side of town and have heard that more and more is coming in tonight, so at least there is some progress being made."
Veterans memorial still out 🫠
"Same, except 5am, Lawndale and Wayside."
"This is the kinda shit I’m afraid of. “Power’s on, everyone come home!”…2 hours of packing and driving later…”Power’s off, retreat!”"
Our side of 77024 is also down as well as internet but the Ring app Neighbors are saying they see CenterPoint trucks in the area
Where can I go to see that
I’m marked orange but have power. I’m not sure it means anything tbh
"Map shows most of [Eado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoUtoqeEw8U) has power. But, [the map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195bcf03ae0c491f9f14bf77f2c43420) hasn't been updated recently."
"It's not supposed to be like that, but multiple people have mentioned similar situations. Contact Centerpoint to make sure they know you only have ""partial service"" with a phase missing."
77011 our building has partial power was wondering the same.
Go outside and see if a phase is disconnected it happens in even moderately windy days
"I have a similar situation, the display for my oven is still working and a few low powered LED lights. Apparently, it may be due to one of your neighbor's generators back-feeding into the grid. It's not good for their generator or unsuspecting linemen. I tried to contact Centerpoint about it with no luck."
Hope you get power soon!
Power also went out again in 77584 near southdown
Still nothing as of 5pm
"77388 Kuykendahl and Cypresswood there’s a snapped pole on 13kv line. No repair activity yet. This will take a least half a day once they start so don’t expect power till tomorrow earliest in that area.

However north of Louetta there should be power getting up by tonight, they are fixing a downed line near Ella Rd substation."
"77389 - Augusta Pines - day 4 and still no power.

Parts of Auburn Lakes (same zip, other side of west Rayford, near Gosling) got power around 7 pm yesterday."
"combing the desert, I am too."
"Nope, not even close. I just came from the target at 1960 which is open but it’s so dark in the store. Most people are using their phone as a flashlight and all the fresh and refrigerated stuff is blocked off. I did a circle of 19 6249 and Hollister, there’s No traffic lights no gas station. Nothing the mall area has some stuff open but when you get away from the mall, the stuff is closed. zero power trucks or crews to be seen anywhere The good news is the boil water notices lifted"
"77074 Braeburn Valley/Bissonnet near Sharpstown High, the worst goddamn sauna known to man…..south side of Braeburn valley has power, neighborhoods on north side don’t"
"77074- bellaire/tarnef too.


Have you seen any trucks or anyone working on it?


I worry for some of the old folks living in De Moss Village"
Manufacturers have been putting anti-siphon gas tanks on cars for a number of years now. Just leave what you have in the cars and go to a gas station for more.

"No. Mine has been orange all day. Randomly got power restored at ~6:30 PM. Just checked right now, and the map still shows my house as orange"
"Just drove by NRG and there is a TON of trucks staged there. Seeing lots going in, none leaving right now. I'm hoping since it's shortly after 8pm that it's a shift change or something work-related because we have no idea when our power is coming back on (77035 near Chimney Rock and W Bellfort) and ya girl is SWEATING!"
77040 I just left there’s still no power hopefully tomorrow is a different story
"I saw an unmarked truck and person with a high vis vest on yesterday afternoon. Looked to be accessing the general area. Not on Buffalo Speedway but on Mercer St. Generally what they’re typically doing as a precursor to fixing an issue. 

It could have been unrelated, but I’m hoping it was tied to the outages at Buffalo Speedway and Richmond."
I was there yesterday but they didn't have perishables
"Yeah, the emergency management czar for Texas just said as much. Apparently 75 generators are from the state and 135 were provided by centerpoint and then they turned their nose up at offers for additional generators from the federal government."
"77067  nothing.  Fm 1960 from willowbrook mall still no power to businesses no power company activity found in Champion section  I figure this area is one of the Sunday, maybe areas.  I have left town as of a couple hours ago.  At least fridge is cleaned out with decaying food trash bags sitting on curb and water lines flushed out after boil notice lifted."
It doesn’t. It updates three times a day at specific times. I’m sorry I don’t rmr the times. It’s something like 8 AM 4 PM 8 PM. Something like that.
[deleted]
"Its bad. Have had power non stop since Tuesday afternoon. Centerpoint still shows my meter as ""Power Out"" and my block as blue."
"Where at in Oak Forest?  I’m looking for updates - my parents are driving from out of town to bring me their generator, but I’d rather not have them make the drive if it’s not needed."
"Dang, this isn't too far from me. Our area is fucked in general."
Lineman are hard at work right now 🙌🏼
"As of an hour ago, no power."
[deleted]
[deleted]
Same zip code but still doesn’t have power on our apartment mist ln 😩
Im in Wilcrest and Westpark and no power since Monday
where on 77002? A lot of it is up; downtown never lost afaik
"Oh snap, that's not too far from me. Hopefully my area gets it soon."
Do you know if the prose apartments right there have power?
Near cross streets of TCJ and Tidwell.
"Some have power, some don't. I heard CenterPoint would be working overnight to fix the issue in my area of 77027 (near Weslayan)… but we still don't have power, maybe they were lying or maybe it takes a long time to fix."
I live in 77027 I have power but our water pumps don’t so still no running water.
"Map means nothing just like CP’s empty promises. That map hasn’t been updated since 6pm yesterday, and probably wasn’t reliable then either. "
"77086 I just called the emergency line about lines down and a transformer that blew days ago and we're showing as blue/assessment completed...but on the phone she said no assessment had been done yet and was putting in an order for me now, 5 days in."
"I live nearest to imperial valley and I've seen plenty of buildings with lights on, atleast as of 7am on the way home from the airport. According to the map we're surrounded by green so it ain't too far fetched; As of pretty much 2pm atleast we have an estimate"
77053 (fuqua & alameda) no power since 5am Monday. I’m blue on the outage map but no date listed for me
So close yet so far away...
Still no power or eta for TC jester / Louetta. CenterPoint map still shows that area as being assessed. Not sure what type of damage that area took for power to be out this long
I just throw my poop at CenterPoint trucks
"Collect ditch water with empty milk jugs, pour into top part of toilet, do your business and flush"
Back during Ike I had a shovel that I drove some wrought iron through and put toilet paper on it.
Houston Strong.
"IAH is back to normal ops. Should not be difficult to get a flight back, even as early as tomorrow "
I hate when they do that
Im at 77489 off Cartwright and still got nothing.
"Also 77057, Woodway and Voss, same as you with no restoration timeline but staying at my home because I don’t want to leave my cats alone. I really hope we aren’t in for another week of this, even the last few days has done a number on my mental health"
"If you’re north of Woodway you’re probably on the same circuit as me based on you saying you were in the teal area of the map. FWIW my neighbour texted a few minutes ago saying they are working on my area now, although I have no clue how accurate that is😆"
"77042 Wilcrest and Westpark, no power since 9a Monday. Hopefully, we’ll be stored soon 🙏"
Whenever they feel like they want to lie to us some more. Progress seems to have slowed today. Must be nice for them to take the weekend off.
What intersection are you close to?
"I'm in Ridgecrest in 77055, which has the same situation. A friend heard from CenterPoint that they aren't restoring nested outages until August.

I was already planning to leave Houston when my child graduates in 6 years, but now I don't know if I can hold on that long."
I’m in your 77 group. I called today and they said there are two power lines down for us and they have a crew assigned but not ETA. I don’t feel hopeful for this week.
"Nice, and that’s close to 77373! Hoping the crews that worked in your area will come to ours next"
"Nice, and that’s close to 77373! Hoping the crews that worked in your area will come to ours next"
"Nice, and that’s close to 77373! Hoping the crews that worked in your area will come to ours next"
My att says it's online about to drive home and see for myself!
Ok so now I got power back but whenever I turn the AC on it instantly starts going on and off until I turn off the AC!  Anybody know what might be going wrong???
Ugh.  One street over and still dark.
Same for Meadowcreek! Hoping it stays on.
How are we getting a person on the phone
Hello neighbor!
Went from 1.64m to 1.61m just now. *I still hate the fuck out of centerpoint but I haven't seen it go up in a while*
"The 'number of outages' is groups of customers that they think are being affected by a single problem. As they fix the larger problems, they discover portions of that previous outage are still out due to smaller problems they couldn't detect earlier. Then what had been a single outage in the stats splits up in to multiple smaller outages that makes the number displayed go up. It's not a very useful number for them to report."
"We had power and it went off over an hour ago (77005), so can confirm at least some people are losing it. Literally and figuratively."
Yea idk what to believe the active outages number that’s going up or the customers affected that’s going down?
Im in orange… circuit level issue. How do I interpret this.
My house has no color…
"Thanks for sharing. It shows my address as ""energized"" when it and its surrounding area definitely are not. :("
[deleted]
Thanks!
Cross streets please?
I just came on here to see if other people were still getting good news so I’m happy to see this! I was starting to feel like we were just doomed for the rest of the week or something
Fellow W Little York/Victory area folks hoping they keep moving West over to 77040
Just south of there! Can Pinemont Plaza come stay with you? You got room on the couch? Only about 50 families. You won’t even know we’re there.
Thanks for this update. I’m also in 77088 area near Antoine and 249 but staying at work in the AC as long as I can. Hoping I’ll come home to power.
I feel like crying but it’s a good idea to save it for bedtime
Me too
Which cross street?
77003 we are still in the dark
what's your intersection ?
"It's not some conspiracy to inflate numbers, they're just inept/disorganized/inconsistent. Call or use the website to re-report that you still have an outage."
"My current estimate is for the evening of June 12th, and our power came back last night."
"Don’t stress too much, I’ve seen people say their estimate was Saturday/Sunday and then it came on an hour later."
"Hey, it could be worse, someone I know got an estimate from Centerpoint for Monday the 15th!"
How are you finding your updates?
"I’m next door, 77063 so this gives me hope 😩😩😩😩🤞🏼"
I have a massive sinus headache from this stale hot air. I also have no heat tolerance so I’m roasting right now.
Reddit posters telling when their zip code is up is way more info than Centerpoint provides.  I signed up for their power alert notifications and still didn't hear a word from CP last time after my power got restored. A redditor had sure as shit called out the zip code here though.
Over month without power after Ike.
Sad part is I see the street behind me with power 😭
What cross streets? That's where I'm at crossing fingers
[deleted]
What map are you looking at
How did you get the update?
You got power yet? I’m in brookside village just east of Avalon Terrace. According outage map provided by centerpoint they have not even begin work in my area. So I’m not expecting to get power back before Friday.
dang it! I was excited at first - I pray it means that they’re in the vicinity and trying to get it back by tonight.
"Some blocks do, some don't. The areas around Alabama/Montrose, Westheimer/Montrose, and Richmond/Montrose seem to. Some of the corner stores open but no ice or gas. But they have cold drinks!"
"I don’t, I’m by the substation on Fairview/tuam"
I'm by Milam and McGowen and have no power still in 77006
77070 Jones rd and Woodedge. We just got power about 2 hours ago!!!
77070 Jones rd and Woodedge. We just got power about 2 hours ago!!!
77070 Jones rd and Woodedge. We just got power about 2 hours ago!!!
[deleted]
Same zip and still nothing :(
Right where I’m at!!! So much shit around that intersection has power
"confirm: 77042 still out this morning, day four"
Yes I’m so happy I can cry! We’re so far back I thought we’d be last 😭
Any one by tio trompo have power? This is so close to us plssssss
Don't jinx it! Same area. 
I’m near Cleveland park as well and don’t have power
Would assume so since they’re working rotating shifts for 24 hour coverage (supposedly)
Mom said it was my turn with the power
"77064 as well, went out just now after being back on since 9 pm last night."
"The numbers on the outage map and their storm center page show many more people with restored power, 1mil+, than their press release at 8:30 which is at only 280K and states they should have a million customers restored by end of day Wednesday.

Not sure which to believe when they can't be consistent in their own communications."
"Thank you! Hot tip for others: Safari would NOT let me go there, but Chrome treated me like an adult and let me make my own decisions."
Same off Bradbury Forest
"Which part of 77055 if you don’t mind me asking. I’m by Hammerly & Wirt, no power for me yet."
same area but still no power for us. Hoping it comes back for us soon tho
Same zip here.  Apartments behind Baybrook.  Still no power
"We’re always close to last.  Abandon all hope from Ceterpoint, ye who enter 77024"
Check your main breaker 
"Yo same here! 77023, every single house around me has power. My neighbors all have power but my house does not. It’s frustrating"
I'm here with no power still.. Took us 3 days to get it last outage so I feel hopeless.
Wat up neighbor i got no power aswell :(
Same
On the border of Kingwood and porter. Still no power. Lots of power lines still have trees laying on them. Not a lot of hope for a quick recovery.
We lost ours after the worst of the storm.   🤨
"77055 and still no power. In the dark, sweating with no hope."
Same here absolutely ridiculous
"Depends where you’re at. Some reported power near Fulshear, so the more west and south of i10, it seems like a higher likelihood of power. 

We’re at 99/westheimer without power since 4:30AM Monday."
I don’t have power but neighbors do at Fry & 99. Crapshoot
77019: Just got power back as of 7:54 am. 🙏
Same over here. Sweaty and musty. Hoping it comes on soon
im also 77450 cinco ranch area without power. some ppl i know here have had power restored but that was earlier yesterday. im so pissed
same...all the lights in the area are out too
[deleted]
"You can check on Comcast by putting in your address at https://www.xfinity.com/support/statusmap and then clicking on the 'house' symbol. They still have no restoration estimate posted for the relative's address I check, but maybe they'll have something for you."
Centerpoint has helicopters???
Yeah close to 2234. But towards Fondren we're still out
You guys have any updates? I think we are on the same grid
No power as of now
"What part? I am near Levy Park and my apartment complex was supposed to have power back but the individual units didn't get power.

I just hope they don't send us to the back of the queue now."
I’m also in the same zip code and live in a small community where the other side of my street (literally 10 ft away) has power but all the houses on my side still don’t have power. I’m confused as to how that even works!!!
"Update when you do, pls, I have stuff on w 34th I need"
The one in Pearland on Shadow Creek is but it’s PACKED.
Waller and katy's both are open to my understanding
Pearland buccees is open 
If you can make it to the one off 290 past cypress it’s open but crowded
What part? It’s a big zip and I don’t have power 😂
Nope
Yes! I’m at the Village at Bellaire complex and it is back on! So thankful.
omg where
no power still ☹️
77054 OST and 288 - we got power and water back around 10am.
"A headache could be due to overheating! Use a wet towel to cool off your head and neck, as well as pulse points. Not sure if there are health restrictions with that but that's what saved me last night as I was getting a terrible migraine. Drink lots of water too, or Gatorade and water, just make sure you up your intake. "
"Same, haven’t had power since 5 am yesterday "
"Yeah I can see some here have and some don’t. We don’t, even though we live in an apartment"
"My address often shows as 77095 AND 77084, and I have power. Nesr 529 and hwy 6. I think the Copperfield target has power, so you can go sit there for some time when it's open"
Barker and tuckerton had power since 5:00ish
Unfortunately no. People 5-10 minutes from us in the same zip code have had power since day 1. House was a cool 92 degrees inside at peak and still blazing. Wondering if it’s possible to sue for being treated against our basic rights
"Lots of people around us have power, but there is a sizeable number of people who don’t. Kinda a mixed bag right now."
77581 got wrecked
"Some do, most are in the dark."
^^
"I think some areas near HCU and the hospital have power, but areas past bellaire and hillcroft still don't."
"I'm in 77074 just off Hillcroft, no power yet"
59 and Beechnut area does. Probably because of the hospital.
yes — same here!! came home this morning to AC and nearly cried 
"I feel you, 77498 I see the houses behind us with their lights on last night hoping they would get ours done. But still without power 😭"
In the same area and nope
Also nope.  Nearest intersection is Chimney Rock and W Bellfort.  Still waiting...
Have you seen if the neighborhoods down tc jester by the cemetery has gotten theirs ?
Which part?
Same here.  77057
Tracker is completely wrong. Centerpoint has no idea the real status of their grid.
Still no power
^^
Please oh please oh please oh please
Omg. Are they at least working out there?
what's your closest intersection ?
They have to turn off some lines to safely make adjacent repairs sometimes. This guy talked about a few examples of that: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/lcik1fn/
Anyone know please ?
That is sorta in my general vicinity...
"That’s about a mile away from me, I hope we get something over night"
"Omg I’m headed home now to 77003, east end. I’m praying my power is on 🙏🏽"
Saw someone say near east end hardware had power
"Where, exactly?"
"Hey neighbor, Connorvale between Ciceter and Crieffe has power, heard over on Ponder they have it too. Downed lines on Lauder near Ciceter so I am still in the dark too"
Anyone around JFK/Aldine Mail Rt with power? Still nothing for us…
"Nothing good. There's lines down in old town spring, at the botanic garden, and on treaschwig - haven't seen a centerpoint worker anywhere. Supposedly they internally are trying to have everybody back online by Friday."
"I drove around earlier this afternoon along 1960 and Kuykendahl and did not see a single linesman or repair truck. No clean up work, no crews, no nothing. Pitch black for miles this evening. They really don't care."
"77099 still down, or rather certain areas. Bissonnet and kirkwood that I’ve seen still have no power"
i just got power at 3 am
"Yeah, Trader Joe’s had a generator. I came into the area and it’s mostly back up."
"Jones/1960 got it yesterday.  I hope you get it today, neighbor.  Im sure seeing so many people around you get power is upsetting."
still none
Since when? If you don’t mind me asking. I’m kinda close to that area so that gives me hope
"Thanks for update, Avalon at Riverstone still out :/"
"Why would they bother doing that?  They're not actually accountable to any of those they serve, only their shareholders.  Might as well avoid the bother and just not communicate."
Centerpoint only updates their lame map 1-3 times per day.
"My parents and gf parents are blue and they have power. My parents were orange yesterday and got power too, so I’m thinking the map still isn’t accurate haha"
Two of my cousins who were in blue have power. One house was in blue for 2 days and then the other flipped to blue this morning and just got power a little while ago.
"When I checked this morning, my address was in orange but our power came back 36 hours prior."
I’ve had power since Tuesday right at the border of an orange now blue circuit in the Heights. Next street over is green though so it could just be a lack of accuracy with the overlays.
"I'm close to Lockwood, promising"
It's been confirmed  !!!! Amen and godspeed to the rest of us 🙏🏾
find him and kill him. ;)
But one block over at Sage and Rice is still dead. Wonder why.
I assume they have night shifts
"Airtex, just sitting in our car trying to stay cool."
[deleted]
"In my case, it did. Was blue Wednesday and Thursday. Thursday night turned to light green. Got power back 1 hour ago. "
Theoretically. Or they might be striving for a more aesthetically balanced whole.
"Don't worry about  that. My part of  in Midtown did the same today, but (shhhh) I never lost power."
"Praise be, except im in breckridge forest II. How can I tempt them to come over to my circuit."
😮 thats my neighborhood!   Whatup  neighbor!  I'm seeing everything around us get power slowly but surely so I'm hoping we'll have power back by sun night
SAME!!! Map shows on and we’re still off. Missouri City.
"I’m in the same exact boat in 77064. I called and reported the outage at (713) 207-2222, but who knows if that does any good. I’ve been getting the bullshit generic updates now with no estimated restoration date, and our area shows “pending review” on the horseshit MS Paint map. 

You’re right… that 18 hours with power was a cruel fucking tease."
"Which area, if you don't mind me asking? I'm in Sheldon and we still don't have shit. :("
I think there was a car accident into a power pole this am at that intersection
Source?
"Some areas have power, some don't. It's a large zip code. In my area of 77066 near west richey and veterans there is still no power."
Also no power yet off of Bammel N Houston and S Trace! Both in Northcliffe and Fountainhead as far as I know
I live close to there but nothing yet. The newest map says I won’t get power until the 17th🫠
What area of 77571?
Same for me. This shit is ridiculous.
I drove around the area around bohemeo’s and my house today and saw no linemen or work trucks. Straight up fucking sucks
"Same area, really hoping it comes back today because I just cannot do this anymore. I’m losing my mind"
"Yeah been without power since Monday and I’m dying, fingers crossed."
Where are you located? 
"What area of 77573, trying to decide if I should get my hopes up or not 😬"
Do you know of Binglewood has power?
I’m still without power in 77080 townhome unlucky
because centerpoint SUCKS
It seems to be a rolling 24 hour window. Last night it was including people whose power had been restored from the storm the day before the hurricane and now it’s not.
"Probably because they are making slower progress this morning than yesterday morning, so the harder work they did yesterday is falling off.  Though that seems to make little sense since I doubt they were doing much work yesterday morning while the hurricane was still in progress."
Near Dixie Farm Rd and Pearland Parkway
"In a complex? if so whole place?

UPDATE can confirm my whole place is back up."
Did yours come back on? I’m also in that zip and am wondering if mine will go out again
Live across Almeda Mall and the power is still down for me. Hopefully they make their way to the southern part of 77034 tonight!
"Hello, which neighborhood or closest intersection?"
woo hoo! hell yeah! that's the stuff.
"Yay for us! Last night when I went in JoeV for bananas there was almost no one inside. I thought, oh the only people here are those with power to cook with, except poor old peanut butter and ‘nana me. "
Most people from Uvalde and Wallisville been having people. My house is closer to the showbiz and the old highway 90 where some powerlines are tipped over and no one seems to want to fix it.
Wunderbar!
"Maybe you can check your internet service app? I have ATT and that's how I found out after the derecho that I had power, it said my network was online"
"Oh shit, word? I'm off Legacy Park and I've been charging my phone at Kroger.

e: Nope. Got jebaited. Fuck you."
"You'll be fine, some areas will still be neglected, but the majority will be up and running like normal."
Few places in tomball at 8am this morning when I drove through
Someone in the other thread saw some trucks around and I saw a text that crews are assessing my apartment area in 77025
Really? I’m in Copper Lakes and still haven’t gotten power back. Here’s hoping soon.
"Oh man, that's just down the street from me... Here's hoping that they are working through the area."
Are the outlets working in the affected rooms? There could be an issue with the line supplying power to your house.
"Fell for the same thing. Saw 5 CenterPoint trucks in my street yesterday evening and they did fuck all, still no power."
🤲
i hope it comes on tonight for 77090 been out 30 minutes into the storm 🤦🏾‍♀️
Did you report the blown transformer or are they already working on those?
Also 77031.  Neighbors across the street got it back Monday too.  Not sure if they lost it again this time around.  We have been out since 7:30AM Monday.
"I think I'm tied to the same part of the grid at cypresswood & 249.

I think we're both fucked well and good..."
"Hold on, be strong.  

You've made it this far and things will be so much better, very soon.

Unless you've been diagnosed with a terminal illness, there's no good reason to jump ship early.  How many problems do you have today that you can be positive you'll have in a year or two?

I've learned over the years that we really never know exactly how something is going to turn out, and often, things turn out a lot better than anyone ever expect.

Call someone.  Take a walk.  You'll be okay."
"Hang on, do you have water & ok on supplies?"
Any update ?
"Same here, and it sucks to see the surrounding areas have power"
Same here in Idylwood.

I'm at 249/99 and not even a flicker yet. Still holding hope it'll be soon.
"I’m 77375, off Kuykendahl near Creekside and power is spotty. We’re still without but strip malls and various subdivisions/apartment complexes have power."
"No power as of 9AM today, but some people down the street did have power last night."
My apartment complex in 77477 is fully out. Near fountains 18 AMC.

77070 here near Jones rd/1960. Powers been out for almost 36 hours and I just came back from driving around for about 45 minutes trying to get ice and didn’t see one CP truck.
Power flickered around 4pm but has stayed dead. Will update when it's back on.
i’m in klein near kuykendahl and still no power
We are 77042 near Westheimer and Beltway and we have power! Hopefully you are next!!
"I am also wondering, I live near the Harris Health on Holly Hall but left town early today because I don't have the mental fortitude. If someone would let me know when it's back on and safe to return that would be amazing 😂"
I live near Fannin and NRG and nothing here 😭 this is testing the patience!!!
 On Holly Hall street still no power

Not all of 77407. Still out in the northwest side sadly
Nope
It's not. But wish it was.
What does blue mean?
I can’t really figure it out.. is blue good?
"They didn't say an exact location, but someone in the other thread said power is back on for them somewhere in the Museum District, around 11pm. https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyxyve/megathread_day_2_of_recovery_got_a_light/lcgm1rv/"
"Hi, glad y'all are ok!
If i may ask....where did you find hotel vacancy??"
🙏🏽 I hope so..there was a one man crew at the bus barn at 9 pm yesterday and a few CP near Beltway 8 and Tidwell.
It probably means they are working on an area near you and you’ll get your power back in a few hours
"Still out, or is it back up?"
"My neighbor texted 77003, Cullen north of 45 got power back last night and 77023 a little past it got I back the day before. I hope that means you’re soon"
"Yes and no...third ward close to 288 has power in some parts. Also, the ExxonMobil near Almeda and Binz has power and gas."
77070 near 1960 and Jones rd and still no power.
No power here yet 
77075 around Forbes Crossing has power back!
"Those replying please name cross streets near you, it would be a big help!"
Still no power at my house. Neighbors literally across the street have had power since yesterday evening. Haven't seen any trucks around today unfortunately. Centerpoint sent my wife an email saying our power was back on a little while ago but it's not.
"None over here, in 77096. Feels bad. ☹️"
"Just came from that area. It seemed to me the whole area between Willowbend/Hillcroft and Chimney Rock/W Bellfort was out, likely even further south because I saw very few houses lit up driving down Hillcroft from 90."
I'm at Willowbend near W Belfort. My across the street neighbors have had power since around this time yesterday. We have none. I don't see anyone on the surrounding block with power. Trying to decide whether to just find an Airbnb somewhere out of town until... Sunday? HOW LONG CAN this go on???
No power at Cedarhurst and Lymbar but I did see lights on several houses just a street away near Cheena and Balmforth.
77036 still no power for me
^^
Power is back over here
What part are you by?
It is open.
"77386, Spring, Imperial Oaks area here. No updates, power’s been out since Monday morning, more or less."
UT housing power back! Celebrate quietly.
"As of 8:30 pm Village grove, baywood oaks, fairmont estates, Santorini and whatever neighborhood is on country rd have power but the river oaks (of Pasadena) neighborhood still doesn’t"
My power just came on about an hour ago Willard/waugh 77006. Couldn’t believe it. I noticed more 77006 people getting power today. It’s still showing me orange and under assessment on map.
Sill out a few blocks from you.
Im in Wilcrest and Westpark and no power :(
I’m staying in the same area but I still don’t have power yet
77082 as well. Last I read is that they were still trying to find the root of the problem and were asking for anyone to report lines down. I also checked the CP map and it says the area is still under assessment. No clue when we’ll see power.
Not me…
"according to the centerpoint outage map, your area is “assigned for repair”. Not sure how trustworthy that is since people said their power was off even when centerpoint sent them messages saying it’s on"
I am in 77388. Still no power where I am at.
"I know some areas are up, but not most, unfortunately"
Nothing but darkness unfortunately
"Sporadic. Clear Brook Meadows has power. Some of sagemont has power. Most of Scarsdale all the way to highway 3 has power. Meadows of Clear Creek has power. Doesn't look like Green Tee has power, and I don't think Riverstone Ranch or Lakes of Goldcrest have power. "
Easily. Very easily.
"According to my partner Mayde Creek wasn’t on the list of campuses that had no power, in a thing sent out by the district"
Woo good luck to your kid. :)
This is insane 
"my old stomping grounds

haven't gotten it back here either"
[deleted]
"They’re out there now, some parts of the neighborhoods are coming back up"
"Lol, I got my power back on Tue and CP stills shows me as ""Power Off"" even though the meter is showing usage stats. Zero comms."
I got my email hours after they had restored power to my home/area.
Power restored today around 9am and no email or text. AND our area still shows as blue / assessment complete with no time estimate for restoration on the map. 
We didn’t get any messages at all
I never got an update for anything
nope i never got an update
"Yeah, saw that this morning.  A lot of the other trees are pretty much taken care of, I saw that all but one of the trees by the Grove over on Lakeside are being chopped up right now, so I'm hopeful once this rain passes they can get back working.  They've been going back and forth in his yard with various parts to reconnect the line for a while."
"Omg still??  I remember seeing your post.  This is insanity!  Im so sorry, neighbor.  This is a shitshow."
"Even weirder: I never lost power; my neighborhood had been light green until sometime today when it went blue, though my power is on.  
I know someone in Lake Jackson who just hot their power back but their neighborhood is still blue."
"I’m actually staying at a friend’s apartment for the day near UHCL because they have power, and the centerpoint map shows them blue."
"We're still in blue and got power for one hour today. 
Hoping it comes back on soon. "
"We're still in blue and got power for one hour today. 
Hoping it comes back on soon. "
[deleted]
Some of it has power and some doesn’t
I live near the Ford Dealership and can confirm we got power back finally!
ugh i’m 77002 and still don’t
"77040 just south of y'all gessner and West Rd. was supposed to have power today, map says we do, still don't even have traffic lights."
"I also fled to Austin and live in 77040. I know my apartment doesn’t have power yet and it seems like many more do not in our area.

I’d recommend checking with a neighbor or trying to remotely connect to something in your home. I’ve been trying to connect to my AT&T fiber wire and checking with the apartment management/other residents."
Probably not. Cause I’m  without power and there’s  only one circuit still down in our area
The north sidegot power but not south of de moss
This is so good to hear😭 I’m in the same area. It’s been green since yesterday but no power
Just got word CP trucks around 77061 Telephone & Bellfort
I'm getting texts and email saying Bradbury Forest will get as of yesterday and today. I'll believe it when Ibsee it. My bothers home on that neighborhood on Birnamwood has pending review still
We’ve had power since Weds night but our CP account still says power is off
i live down the street near quail valley east and its dark in that area 
"In Meadowcreek. Still nothing. 

I feel defeated."
Terrible. I'm sitting in my car for AC right now. Drinking a beer because it may help me sleep tonight
"I left to go stay with a friend up in Dallas and am now in a hotel there until tomorrow… Praying that by some miracle the power will be restored by tomorrow night. And wouldn’t you know that my car’s AC stopped working on top of everything, too."
Hopefully it’s true. We are a cluster in 77006 and were told 7/19.
[deleted]
New map just dropped. My neighborhood was saying yesterday but it's been updated to Thursday now. I hate this shit
Just came back on with power!!!!!!
"Moved milk for kids into a freezer in a house with power; we did throw away literally all the food in the fridge. Our fridge is pretty new, so kept the temperature for more than 48 hours, but once the (cow's) milk hit 60 degrees, we made the decision to chuck it all."
"Yes. You can try to buy bags of ice to preserve the food. Or use a generator to create electricity from gasoline or natural gas. If you don’t have the time or resources for that, then your food goes bad and you throw it all out.

This should not be happening in a first world country…"
"You keep buying ice (if you can find it) or take the L and toss everything. I’ve had lots of take out, protein bars, or friends with power kindly cooking us dinner."
Which area near highway 6?
"Cross street? I'm in 77338 as well and still no power for me
ETA: I'm in the Cypresswood Point area"
"I'm also in Humble, but without power still. Around Kenswick/Lee Rd area"
Cross streets? I'm on Kenswick and 1960 but staying with my dad now because he has power. I was going to drive back tomorrow to check on things since I don't entirely trust the CenterPoint map
Im moving out of houston when i get the chance 😭
"I doubt it will be that big of an issue. If you refill the tank (the top part of your toilet) with other water (from a swimming pool, for example), you can flush the toilet. Hopefully the people who stayed will have figured that out."
"Same zip, Neighbors across the street and behind me got their power. Im feelin' left out lol"
"Same zip, same situation. No power still."
Ouch my neighborhood never went out lol
"77471 here, no power as well. Centerpoint trucks were up and down my block looking lost around 7:30PM. Hopefully they’ll be able to restore power soon, house is getting toasty now"
"I really hope it's back soon, I went driving around with the kids and got excited when Brazos town center lights were on. Came home to a dark apartment :("
"Apartment in 77096 still has no power, hoping we’re soon…"
Nearest crossroads? I’m right behind Lowe’s. Wondering if this could mean power will be back soon :/
Holy cow.  This makes me giddy with anticipation.  Still on?!
"You know if the Foodarama on S Post Oak, near Willowbend has power? I was trying to use the ice machine outside there yesterday, but it wasn't running. I'm gonna need to get more ice soon."
"I know that whole foods and the light at the intersection at San Felipe and Post Oak had power yesterday pretty quickly after the storm. I just got power in 77056 in the apartment off Yorktown Street between San Felipe and Westheimer, so if you don't have power yet, it should be coming soon I think."
I’m 77098 and have been without power for 36 hours now :(
Where about are you? Still no power on the north end of Meridiana
"""Rolling blackouts"" are when there isn't enough power being generated by the power plants. That hasn't been a problem at all. They are periodically having to turn off previously-powered areas so that they can safely repair an adjacent area."
Where in 77004 are you? I'm in 77004 by Baldwin park and have not gotten power at all since Monday morning.
"Same here.  Am hoping for the best.  6 unit complex, 3 on one side have power and we (part of the other 3 do not) CP shows energized."
"It's a generic message they've been gradually sending to everyone, they started sending it out yesterday."
77045 down the road from you came on 10 minutes ago.
Centerpoint projected Friday-Sunday MAYBE onward for power :(
I would do that or see if you can stay with a relative that has power. That's what my family ended up doing yesterday. We got power back around 4:00-4:30pm yesterday.
77066 got a call stating it would be back eod Saturday or earlier
77018 at 7:15pm got power back on Cheshire Lane near TC Jester.  The other side of our street had it Tues. afternoon.
Which cross street? Apparently they're staging trucks in the target on Westheimer and walnut bend
What zip 
You sweet summer child
"It’s wild to me that they don’t. Back when I lived  in Louisiana all tracking was so much better. Detailed maps for outages, real storm path irl so we could see where in the county it currently was, etc.

It’s my first big storm in Houston and it’s wild how much worse the information is vs Louisiana. The infrastructure I’d been warned about, but not lack of information…"
"no, but Whataburgers app is working pretty well to let people know what stores are open (so assuming they have power). Saw that on a pearland facebook page. Hope that helps"
[deleted]
It was a strengthening cat 1 and basically a borderline cat 2 when it made landfall. that plus Houston remained in the storm's strong side the entire time worsening wind and flood damage (especially during a high tide)
We are taking our dog and kids to a hotel. (77005)
"Happy for you, WWW.

What building are you in? And do you know if the Lofts on Post Oak has power now?"
"Husband called and got through relatively quickly, but the agent was a real butthead. 10/10, do not recommend."
You meant the Walmart on Westpark? 👀
"They turned on the substation that was out, which was the first level of outage for you. Now the next level issue of local line/transformer will be identified, they will send a note saying exactly how many houses are out in your area and will be resolved later. Be prepared for days more without power unfortunately."
Very comforting I'm very close to that area
Same around Auden bissonet
"The shopping center at Falcon Landing and Gaston has power - the one with Kroger, Sonic, Raising Cane's, etc."
Live in the same zip code and still nothing. 🫠 hope im next
Which road?
kill me
Promising
Do you mind sharing nearby street intersection?
Where you at? I don’t have power but others on my block do 🥲
"lol, they just changed the fucking map color grid."
Apparently someone said they saw a team of trucks in our area. So here's to another day of false hope.
Our area has been blue for the last few days with no luck. You may have better luck.
"According to my nonresponsive doorbell cam, no"
Does anyone w access to the CP tracker see what the estimate is for 77007?
Last time I checked we went from “assessment in progress” to “assessment completed” whatever that means for the future 🤷🏻
"I drove up and down Memorial; the parkway seems mostly dead, power-wise. I've been surprised in general that Shepherd/Memorial, the intersection, has been without power for so long. It seems that we really have far less powered places concentrated along that road. Surprised in general. "
I saw crews near Cleveland Park about an hour ago but no power so far
Still no power north of memorial
Nope still in the dark.  In Bellagio at least
"Neighborhood off c e king, nothing here either"
"Nope. Off Aldine Westfield near the taco bell, still nothing"
If you call to report an emergency (713-207-2222) they'll put you through to a human.
"Electricity is FINALLY back up, over 200 hours later.
Thanks to this subreddit and everyone in it for helping keep me updated. Even though this was a frustrating experience, reading y’all going through the same struggle was cathartic 

💟&☮️"
"It was Tuesday, not Monday"
yeah but no one's gonna openly doxx themselves. zip codes are the closest things we have
Some reporting power is back but not sure if it’s everyone
"I know we had some CenterPoint guys out here yesterday, but haven’t seen them today. Hopefully others have seen them slowly moving about?"
"centerpoint is definitely in that zipcode and restoring, ours came back on last night briefly, there was an explosion, it went out again, and then came back on a few hours later.  As of yesterday afternoon, also saw power nearby on 529 between barker and fry, several restaurants were open and gas stations. HEbs all seemed open on generators, and krogers too, fiestas seemed closed (all as of 3pm yesterday)"
Some places on TC jester north of I-10 have power but it really varies on where you are specifically:/
"I'm in 77049 near Crosby. We had power for 10 minutes this morning, but it shut off again and we haven't gotten it back since."
Not yet
Darn. My mother stays in that zip code.
Still off for me
Nope no power… west park is in my side yard… Kroger & Academy have power though.
Got power at Creekside Ranch and Westheimer Lakes
77401 got power back last night (July 9)
77006 Mulberry <> Yupon south of Westheimer just came on in the last hour. I think this is one block east of Mandell...
Friend who lives in Woodstream said linemen finally started showing up on Northpark just an hour ago. Hopeful!!
A few people got power 7/10 at around 6pm
"where? I'm by hwy 6 and 529, also 77084 and we got power last night"
Hey I'm which area are u in I'm in 77025 and my powers still down 
Which part cause I don’t have any and I’m in that zip code
1.2 miles to Target on 8500 Main St
"There has been progress, heard mi mom has her power back on. Fridge and ac thermostat circuit breakers keep trippin tho, so fans only

I would say only fans but that sounds downright weird"
At least partially restored.
What crossroads? Jackson and McGowan still without
Same zip code and I lost it just after 9:00 AM. I thought I was going to make it through just fine without my power going out at that point.

Did your power come back? Hope you're ok."
"Same, no power."
Just drove through there and traffic lights were still out. Don't have more info but at least it means not everybody is on yet.
Same. Center point has no ETA for the area. Jones has been lit up since Tuesday tho
A friend that is in 77035 close to Willowbend & Bellfort got power back last night. I did see a bunch of utility trucks staged in the Walmart parking lot this morning.

"Apparently, according to the map, a neighborhood near Northwest got power.  Other than that, nothing. "
Omg no way 
Kess Line or Sumter?  They've been doing work for us in Seabrook right off 146 past Red Bluff and they've been kicking ass.
Update: Yesterday 7/12 I got a phone call and email that said restoration by end of 7/12. My area has been green/restored on the map since yesterday. Couldn't confirm but drove an hour through the rain and traffic back into Houston only to get another call and email two lights from home. Restoration now expected by end of day Monday. No power on my block as of 6pm. Drove back out to the country. Fuck Centerpoint with a cactus.
You and all of your neighbors should be calling Centerpoint+ document each call. If they don't get out to fix it before it falls insurance will be able to go after them.
"Same zip, but we didn't lose ours until 9:30a or so. Still hasn't come back on. A couple of the gas stations at 290 and Mangum/Antoine seem to have power. The Joe V's had power last I checked around 5p. Most places that seem to have power are closer to the freeways, but they could be running on generators"
It’s because the hotel counts as one customer they need 1 million cust fix
Dude you’re posting here non stop you’re driving yourself crazy. I get it but there’s nothing you can do but wait unfortunately. 
"77004, near the same area, still without power. I feel you. "
"I live in 77354 and I didn’t get cell service until I made it to 99 headed towards i10. I have AT&T, I showed I had bars but nothing would work"
Deep forest off of antoine is still out. Heard west little york at bingle area some people got theirs back today.
Where?
I’m in imperial oaks off Aldine Westfield. Still out here 
Half of Legends Trace back up. For some reason the half that shared the grid with the Mud and Fire Station is still down....
"I'm in the same zip, house off Sheldon. no power since 5am Monday, if you drive down Business 90 you will see at least 10 light poles dislodged and fallen over. I fear our area will take quite a while but fingers crossed we at least get someone to start work soon."
Me same zipcode. I've been driving around  to see if I could see any centerpoint trucks. I've only seen one and they were just chilling in the Northshore administration building parking lot. It seems they haven't even started in our area.
Replying for visibility.  No power here in Idylwood.
Oh no that's really unfortunate. At least you can power a fan.
Where?
Have you heard anything/seen any progress?
They'll work through the weekend. Also in 77096 :( 
"I think they’ll say that they are working through the weekend. But I don’t think they are even working through the night, even though they say they do. I don’t ever see any kind of downward momentum in the numbers overnight. 

On my drive home yesterday evening, I saw what could have been crews working. All through the day, while I was at work I would see people posting pictures on Ring/Nextdoor of other trucks in our zip code. But by nightfall, every one of them was gone. This morning I ventured out to find food; it looks like a ghost town.

I don’t know if it’s that they straight up lie about the over night crews; but it seems very likely to me that the night crews are an order of magnitude less effective. If you’re not familiar with the area and you run into some issue, there’s going to be less resources available at night that can answer questions or help out with logistical needs. All this goes double for the weekends. 


I feel like a fucking idiot for being so optimistic yesterday morning, thinking that I’d be part of the lucky bunch."
"77095 no power in my subdivision, but power in all surrounding areas :("
where at? that’s my zip code but still no eta on the new map.
"I've seen a few trucks around here, including what looked like an electrical contracting company. My power is still out"
Still out of power and the ETA is the 16th
Which area?
"They admitted to not being prepared because they didn't think the hurricane would be this bad. All out-of-state help arrived AFTER the hurricane and not before, in place and ready to go. I'll try and find that link again and post it.

CenterPoint's outage map was down for the first 36ish hours after hurricane Beryl hit, and many people had to rely on the Whataburger app of all things to tell which areas in Houston have power.

Meanwhile, these are the type of statement coming from CenterPoint - “Our restoration progress so far reflects our continued commitment to deliver on our promises to our customers."" The promise being a low bar recovery to under half of the affected people in the first 72 hours and another sixth of the people come Friday.

When Houston regularly hits triple digit temperatures at this time of year, you HAVE to prepare for the worst. CenterPoint didn't do that in my opinion, and now people are starting to die from the heat."
"It’s tough, many people saw this coming based on ICON and euro models well before the NHC confirmed it, so if Centerpoint has a strict policy of following NHC and that’s their agreement with the state, then yes the policy is the blame. I felt by paying attention it was clear earlier this would hit Houston and they should have been prepared for that.

The bigger question is was our deregulated power policy to blame, and zero incintive or requirement to improve the power grid. Similar to California we have a publicly traded monopoly in Houston to manage our utility, versus a government entity. Centerpoint primary role is responsibility to shareholders versus the citizens they serve. What is their incintive to build the best grid and take $6billion in profit each year when they are responsible to shareholders versus the people. 

Feels like we need a better energy policy that balances keeping corporate style efficiency and reduced beaurocrscy, while also taking ownership of the strength of the utility system versus just servicing the existing system, and incentiving better infrastructure versus responsibility to shareholders. Utilities are too crucial to have either a monopoly or not government ran. If we want to go deregulated then let counties, municipalities  and our tax dollars bid out for service amongst multiple companies to decide what infrastructure each community  needs, and how resilient they want to pay for, if we keep the servicing and infrastructure private, or pivot back to government ran but deal with the inept beaurcrats and government ran problems like in many other industries.

We need to come together as a state and figure out a better model that works for all, but has flexibility for those willing to pay more for better service

Why can’t I hire an electricity repairman to replave the transformer that blew up behind my house like I can a roof or a fence or a car or an internet modem."
Woah woah don’t be asking Redditors for any sources or rhyme or reason. And don’t you DARE give the republicans any break. Not in MY liberal haven website!
Walk me through the logic of saying a smaller storm than Ike would cause LARGER outages than Ike?
What intersection?
"I've been very happy with entergy in our area but we've been down since 9am yesterday and all I get is ""we are aware of the issue"".

Not only that, gas is now out everywhere, I JUST got cell phone data back 24 full hours later and it's 90f+ today."
"Storm repairs take time for any company. At least Entergy's outage map is massively better than Centerpoint's. Detailed red and green lines, love it."
Look at bro hella baitin’
As you can see by the pootdoots it is only getting worse
"Nope. You may have gotten communication, but I’ve gotten nothing from them. All I have is their outage tracker, their maybe updated once a day map that doesn’t really tell me anything, and what I’ve read on the news. No emails, no text messages about anything. "
"Their communication is shit and the online updates are just lies. People would rather be told, ""We don't know how long it will take"" than lied to"
"I have gotten NO COMMUNICATION from them. So good for you, but your experience is merely anecdotal."
"I’m not, fuck center point and fuck Jason Patrick wells"
No. Just no. And shame on you.
Seems even worse this time imo
"Because you had it worse, we shouldn't be frustrated and worried about the children and animals suffering in the heat? Or people new to Houston that weren't aware/couldn't afford to be prepared in this economy should just suck it up?.. glad what comes around goes around. You seem insufferable"
"This heat with no power can be super dangerous for some people, especially those with medical conditions that require refrigerated medicine. If you’re so prepared, go help someone in need rather than be an asshole here."
Centerpoint should have too. Mobilization should have been ready right after the winds died and it left the area.
">You will be fine for a few days- you should have prepared for this outcome.

So despite paying a fortune in property taxes, and a fortune in fees to CenterPoint, we should expect to be on our own after a storm that was barely a Cat 1?

How do I get a job that pays as much as that CenterPoint CEO and has literally zero expectations of performance or accountability?"
No one wants to hear your one-up story and condescending tone.
Congrats you’re an ass! Hope you go 22 days without power since you’re so used to it!
Hard to do when you have loved ones with health problems... People will lose their life because of the heat.
"As people that were in Harvey. Try also dealing with the MUCH HIGHER cost of living coupled with family members on hospice relying on a generator but not being able to get gas because the nearest place is 15 miles away and there's a tree on your truck. But I guess I should have ""prepared"" for a healthy tree to fall on my truck. Right?"
Suffered 2 weeks with Ike and I’d never post this bullshit. It sucked then and it sucks now.
"some of us are diabetic and need to keep our insulin refrigerated or we can't take it. some of us need generators to keep family alive. some of us are new to the area or visiting or are in other situations where having no power puts us at a huge disadvantage.

People can die without electricity. You're not helping anyone by being cruel."
It sounds like he works in the industry and has access to data the rest of us can't see.
"ultimately it doesn't answer each persons individual 'when does *my* power come back?""  That question is much harder.  I saw a map of the woodlands where a large portion of distribution lines had yet to even be evaluated.  The backbone is coming back, the smaller lines snaking out will take longer because there are so many more of them.

Telling you that WO JN line is back in service is pretty useless to almost everyone but a highly select audience, which is why they don't do it."
"Update 2230 on 7/12:

- The 345kV autoxfmr in the immediate area along with a corresponding crosstown 138kV line (through the Heights to Liberty/Wayside/Crosby) are still on outage.  A tentative return of 7/13 1700 remains unchanged for the xfmr, the line segment estimates have not been updated, still showing 7/10 2200.  Speculation:  the damage on these two particular segments appears to be heavy because the other segments returned on 7/10 as expected.  There is likely some major snag like heavy equipment, fallen high-kV towers, or loss of critical equipment at the stations.  Power can get to the Heights without this line but my guess is that it is the impact right now.

- Belfort and Kirby, nearby major load breaker is on outage, started today at 0900 and runs until 7/15 1700.

- Work is slated from Pearland through Friendswood, League City, towards the coast by Dickinson.  This complex of lines will be out tomorrow from 0700 to 1700.  Impacts will likely be minimal, they are trying to avoid disrupting more customers.

- Work in Galveston is largely complete on high kV lines."
"The guy said, ""I cannot tell you anything about zip codes or neighborhoods or individual distribution lines."" You should ask as a top-level comment in this thread, instead of in reply to that guy. 

The fewer houses that are affected by that tree being down, the lower priority it will be. They are still working on bigger outages first."
"Yeah, it’s street by street apparently. A few hrs ago I drove around and some traffic lights were working and some weren’t."
"There is power at the intersection of 1960 and Perry. I filled up my car with gas there at one of the two stations there. I believe Mills and 1960 has power as well (traffic lights are lit), but no gas stations at that intersection."
I’m also in 77095 (Copperfield) but got power around 5-6pm
"77095 near CyFalls High School, electricity turned on at 8:30PM for 5 seconds. Still no news yet, speculations that our house gonna get the blackout throughout midnight"
"I’m in 77095, (sommerall) still no power"
"we drove down 1960 lots of power for all the stores, lights fallen down, all our houses and neighborhoods pitch black though, we found ice at 7/11 thankfully, dont get out its a madhouse"
"yeah we are on Perry on fm1960 drove and a neighborhood behind us on greencreek are all lit up saw them come on but 10ft to our little circle is off, Jones Rd still pitch black oof im hoping later tonight"
"Thank you so much for this comment. I’m a new cat owner, and this is my first outage with my kitties. I have plenty of food and water for them. 💖"
I’ve been so worried about my cat. Thank you!
Thank you for this. Worried. 🙏
I have plenty of water and always feed them wet food for dinner. Thank you for the reassurance. Mostly worried for them at this point. Glad to hear they’re tough
I imagine its just as fake a number as the old one.
It would be pretty easy to display both.
100%

Honestly it makes me think of a coworker that won't let us use orange and red in spreadsheets bc it makes them feel bad
You made me LOL 😆 SO THANK YOU 😊 
Makes sense. I get it. I'm gonna head to the in laws tomorrow for power when it gets bad lol.

Praying for you brother.
WE GET SURCHARGED FOR THIS SHIT?!
Yeah in Buffalo it’s all national grid but there at least we have gas stoves. Here everything is electric. I just said to my husband we need to book a flight to Philly and go stay at our beach house in cape may this is for the birds
Shepherd and 13th. It’s SO HOT
It absolutely seems like they’re prioritizing businesses over residences - it’s horrific.
This is the way.
"Oh yeah we got a notification from Xfinity as well saying ""we know your Internet is down"". I'm like I don't care for that just give me power. We've also been without power since 6am Monday "
Here’s to trying lol I appreciate it
Im lucky to have friends to crash with so luckier than most. Maybe im asking for too much but i just wanna exist in my own home after work ya know. Definitely counting my blessings but sometimes we all have to bitch and moan. Hope you’re doing alright
My power is out again as of 10:30am so it was only temporary relief.
Lol I saw that as well
Yeah about the time they dropped to around 340k in the last 24 hrs. And it hasn't gotten better.
Hey zip neighbor. Also 77339 in Elm Grove. Would you mind sharing your village? Can pm and no pressure of course
We got it back (south of Buffalo Bayou) a few hours ago so there’s hope trucks are still there.
Could you bring a laptop to somewhere with WiFi? Some stores and libraries have reopened and have working WiFi.
CenterPoint calls it the Thanos Protocol
"Leadership in this state is unprepared, inept, and too busy playing in Asia."
Our city is 1:1 following what New Orleans went through years before Katrina. My good dollar says Houston will be in ruins within the next decade or two.
"Idk where you are exactly, but where I am wind speeds weren’t reported above 60mph, so technically not a hurricane when it got here."
What cross-streets? You said 77096? Do you have anyone that can pick you up to take you to a cooling center?
We might live in the same complex. A street separates the side that has power and the side that doesn't?
North Braeswood and Chimney Rock
"Darn every house on our block has power expect for ours this is crazy. The deer park areas, la porte and Pasadena no updates"
okay thank you so much😪 really helped out me at ease
Came back as I ran out to get ice. 
I've slept in my car every night. It's 96 in my apt all day and 90 plus until around 2 or 3 am. About 4 or 5 am it's bearable to go back inside but still sweat trying  to sleep. I got a dog that doesn't do well on the heat so burning half a tank of gas a day just to keep us cool is insane.
"Came on last night around 7pm. Gotta be because of this storm. It was pouring, bad lightning and even had wind again…"
"that’s reassuring! i’ve been worried all day they’d take their publicity W and move on somewhere else even though all the residences and signals are still dark across the way from a handful of businesses. hopeful that plays out here today too lmao, thanks!"
"I just walked down Colombia and saw several porch lights on, a few indoor lights on (it didn't sound like they were running generators) AND a CP truck on the corner of 18th and Colombia. That's the best assessment I can offer."
really? where?
I'm across Willowbend from there and am literally praying for power!!!
Are they still there?
near n.braeswood & fondren
That’s because they’ve turned the breakers on for people who they can and they have no linemen out doing things right now.
"Dang, you gave me hope 😂"
What’s odd is that during the freeze power outage and the derecho we were completely fine and had power the entire time. Didn’t lose any power 😭 guess my luck ran out
"I am hearing the same crap. We live right around the corner from Kolter Elementary school and we have no power but Kroger, CVS, Jack in the Crack, Mr. Car wash etc… has power right out of our neighborhood. This sucks balls."
Beechnut/Renwick crossing has power since Tuesday.
"713-207-2222 is the number to use, you just have to keep trying. Some people do eventually get through. Or if you can sign into your account on the Centerpoint website, there is also a way to report outages/problems from there, in an online form."
Please call CP and report.  All our neighbors need to call everyday so CP can act on it.  800-245-2377.  Sometimes I go straight through.  Sometimes it's a 45 min wait but I report everyday we are without power.
T C Jester just south of I10
Patterson north of I-10. Heard a loud bang a few minutes ago and the power blipped but it came right back so must be someone else's transformer.
"Would you be willing to PM and share your cross-street? I’m nearby but don’t have power, and we could really use the hope!"
Is yours back on as well?
"I stand corrected, The article says EOD wednesday, whereas the headline does not say EOD.

Everyone's odds just dropped to 20% tomorrow then. This sucks."
"No idea, it's on the front page of the chronicle website right now, I assume spokesperson

https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-weather/hurricanes/article/beryl-live-updates-houston-weather-19559699.php#centerpoint-energy-expects-to-restore-power-to-1-million-customers-by-wednesday-evening-022026"
Sorry.  It’s all over twitter.
our neighborhood has power it's just us and a few houses that were affected by that damn branch. too frickin hot so we came to stay at my aunt's house. we called this morning and they said they'd send someone. called about 2hrs ago and got the same response... clearly we're not a priority so it's a waiting game. hope your family is doing well!
Uh... Inflation. THOUSANDS if you have separate fridge and freezer.
Same.
Oakbrook
That's absurd... considering that getting power back to the Galleria mall/apartments in that area should be a top priority. Hoping y'all get your power back soon. My apartment has been notoriously good about keeping power (we had power throughout the derecho that hit)
Getting power back ~48 hours after a hurricane hits your area is doing pretty good. Many people may be out for a week or more.

[deleted]
That’s incredible! I definitely will. Thank you for sharing
I'd keep quiet or they'll take it back.
"Same here, other than calling 713-207-2222, is there anything else we can do?"
Hope so because still nothing -_- 
"What part are y’all in

I’m sitting 77095

Out since 7am or so,  it even a flicker back"
I believe River Oaks and a few other communities . (I’m in 77077) Whats your zip? I can give the closest gas station for you thats here.
Memorial north of westchase. Think Kirkwood and memorial intersection area.
"Westchase / Energy Corridor area. Power has been on for a while in this area here and there. There were a number of stores, including gas stations, open on Westheimer outside BW 8 yesterday."
Briefly came on for an hour last night and has been out since 9 last night
I’ve done it online a ton of times but can’t get through on the phone. Very disheartened that my whole block is green
I called Centerpoint and they said their map was wrong
Power is out in my neighborhood butI saw about 15 centerpoint trucks camped out in the target parking lot down the road..
there's no way no one hasn't called it in - complete BS!
"Thanks, I fled to a relatives house. But the condo’s living room windows don’t open, they’re sealed shut. And the bedroom window cracks open a little but without airflow it’s just terrible. Appreciate you though."
25th & Durham power just went back out
Austin doesn’t sound too bad right now.
Same. I had my garage lights (LED) come on for a few minutes. Truly bizarre.  Im in the energized zone. Maybe they’re counting the five minutes of super low voltage.  Definitely about 50 homes in this “energized” zone or nested outage or whatever the hell they’re calling it.
To be fair their restoration date estimations are all wrong anyways. They called me and said they’d have my power restored by Sunday… many hours after they already restored it
I fucking know 😭😭😭
Some places in our Zip got power
unfortunately still no power as of 4:30pm 7/10 :(
Is anyone else now getting an error when trying to check this map now? I had no problem until about 12:30 pm. Now it says Service Unavailable. 
"Whataburger app has a map of whataburger locations that are open, people are using it to see what areas of  houston have power."
"3rd hurricane for me personally, this is honest not a really bad one, but the power is out a lot longer than the previous ones... Maybe just the location, maybe it's the fact they didn't prepare"
We’re 77429 but closer to huffmeister. Power still out
Literally thinking the same for myself. Unsure as to which areas are up to reserve a room.
Probably the system catching up.
Wtf
That’s literally a mile from me I just seen a truck pass by y’all should be up soon
"just drove by my place,  nothing 😔"
I swung by again just now and they gone  and my power is still out 😭 maybe they’re on lunch or needing to get parts/supplies 😭
Prepare for disappointment apparently
I'm in the same boat :(
Yep. Almost every part of the map I click on says that. A few say July 13 or 14.
"Yes, but I had to search my address and click/tap on it for it to show me ETA."
Click on your dot or the highlighted area around it
Mine is just showing # of customers affected when I tap on my area and the colors are all Different now (various shades of brown) 
You have to click on your dot or the highlighted area and it should show up
Most places I click just say “we will continue to provide estimated restoration times as they become available.” Super helpful centerpoint! 
This confuses me…is everyone really meant to call and report their outage? On the news they said there is no need to call
That’s not a working number…
you’d think they’d work the shifts around so that it’s a 24/7 effort. i suppose that makes too much sense
Truly I hope this will be over shortly for you and everyone else. We all deserve to sleep peacefully in AC and have a fridge that keeps food cold! 🙏🙏🙏🙏
"it will bro, stay positive!!!"
"Today was the first time I’ve seen linemen all week in the area. I hope it means we get power soon, but with this storm hitting I’m losing faith."
"Hi, did it come back on in 77040? I'm not home but my 2 teenagers are. Neither one of their phones are working so I'm just trying to see if the power came back."
Update! Power has returned for me on Egbert Street and TC jester as of 3:30pm today (Sunday 7/14) phew finally!
From my understanding that was a disaster declaration not a state of emergency. The difference is state of emergency allows federal agencies to lend their assistance while a disaster declaration is essentially asking for more funding. But maybe I’m misunderstanding.
"Reminds me of [this tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@travel.bestie1/video/7387190463641488671) I saw a few days ago where people in the comments were wishing a random Sandals resort manager was a presidential candidate. Who would win in a fight: a random hotel manager or the leadership of a company that serves 2m people in the ""energy capital"" of America?"
"JPS serves a bit over 600k customers while Entergy serves a little over 500k in Texas. They also have roads connected to unaffected cities, unlike Jamaica which is an island. Not to mention the human and financial capital here that Jamaica could only dream of."
No problem at all. I totally understand…..& I can imagine CP is inindated with calls. My guess is that we are better off relying on each others comments at this point. I will update when it returns. ☺️
We have power again! Thank goodness because we were melting!
is it now on?
I’m near Westheimer & Montrose. No power since yesterday morning.
An excellent argument against hypothetical Texas succession
"Are you certain? I don’t think I’ve ever seen the tracker go down at night, nor have I had my power come on overnight following one of these storms. It makes me think they won’t do any more restoration until the morning."
"I’ll post immediately if the power comes back! I did notice the light at the Whole Foods/Trader Joe’s on Voss was fixed yesterday, and the one at Winrock and Woodway is at least flashing red."
Nice. I’m in the orange area a little farther north.
read that yesterday in another comment and didn’t want to believe it :(
"I heard a tree fell on some power lines right by where you are :( I really, really hope they get to y'all soon. It's torture."
Mill rd 😕
Thank you so much. Stay safe yourself 🙏🏾
One car left the Mount Logan substation by the time I got back. Could be done for the night.
Houston strong my dickk
Sorry for peeps out there but I do savor the irony.
meyerland area!!
"Yep my area is still under “date estimation pending”

They won’t even tell us what’s wrong !"
"Right, there’s a weird pocket of no power because I look at the map and there is green surrounding us. I’m assuming it’s because of the two downed poles that’s next to the CVS Walgreens , seeing the lineman near by does give me hope though."
Hammerly blvd
Same here.
When I called them yesterday they said today (7/15) but they’ve been saying that since Friday so we’ll see
mind-blowing. “we didnt know itd be *this* bad!” we had plenty of warning. jesus christ
But that costs more. It's like you don't even care about the shareholders
"It wasn't quite as hot, but still there were *much* fewer people willing/able to live down here until air conditioning became a thing."
Keep in mind that the architecture complimented the environment. These new housing units don’t with their carpet and what not
I stand up when I wipe. better leverage
"I just got out of pending review, now I'm lookin at Wednesday 🤦‍♂️"
"ugh i hope tonight
i’m hot lol"
No power still.  We are leaving the area.  F this and F centerpoint
Honestly. I'm gonna need a beer at the end of this week lmao.
"You too, good luck and stay cool."
Same this morning. I have honestly given up hope. It feels like they just forgot about us🙃
Yea this shit is unbearable I'm not sure what to do lol
Just got out of the shower and just reheated like some damn pizza rolls. Also now I know to purchase a battery powered fan 😭🤣
"I was thinking about looking for some battery powered fans earlier in the day, but assumed anywhere that had them would've been sold out by now."
FM1960 and Jones Rd. We finally got power about 2 hours ago around noon!!!
FM1960 and Woodedge. We finally got power about 2 hours ago!!!!
"Likewise, one can only hope."
"I appreciate that. And I hope so too! My power came on this morning and now I just really feel for everyone without. I’ve been offering my apartment to take in small animals/small dogs, but I understand it may be tough to trust a stranger randomly offering this"
Omg what intersection? I saw the line as I was leaving so I’m not there right now
Our office has power but afaik our sister company’s building doesn’t. I wonder when that will be fixed
[deleted]
They are on a generator. I live right next to it and they don’t have power right now or at least when I was by there at 11am.
Honestly it kinda cracked me up
"Nope not yet. Luckily we're staying with family that has power, but I'm gonna go back and check on the house later tonight/get more dog food anticipating a longer stay away from home. Hopefully it's back by then and I can bring everyone else with me, but I've kinda lost all hope at this point"
It came back about half an hour ago!
They had crews working on the downed pole at Beechnut/Chimney Rock so they are definitely working around the area now
You and me both...
I haven’t gotten any texts (not enrolled in it) I have received calls from CNP though. Just telling me to be prepared to be without power. Have been getting them since Monday evening
Yes
So frustrating.
I think that may also impact the spring lake neighborhoods. Fingers crossed that power is restored soon for everyone.
"Mine just came back on!


All of my electronics are still unplugged, though. I am wary of power surges. I will probably plug them back in tomorrow after work.


I am going to let the AC work it's magic for a couple of hours and start cleaning. It's been too hot to do anything. The damned place looks like the morning after a frat party."
Washington @ Sawyer
That’s atrocious. Especially for how much we all pay. Do you know a way to find out an eta?
And hoard fuel
I just dragged the fucking beast inside (turned it off first obvs)
Did you get yours back yet? We haven’t had any luck. A huge tree fell on the power lines leading into our neighborhood and the entire community is without power.
Also nada 77346
Ohhh a bit lucky huh lol
I think (and hope) that the water pump is connected to the power. Just drove down westheimer and it seems patchy. I’m Fondren x westheimer and seeing a lot of 77063 starting to slowly come online to fingers crossed 🤞🏻
Today would have been great. Some of us are still waiting.
I did already. My meter isn’t showing any numbers so I am off the grid
Lmao this is exactly what got me through the night too
I assume Courtyard
"Hopefully, there is literally no damaged lines all the way down to Antoine and all the way to the beltway. So I'm not sure what the hold-up is."
Beechnut and 6
yes
West of Weslayan
"On Yale and Heights at least everything seems on. Lights are working, shops are open"
85 checking in.
Can't even do that water is tied to the power... 77011
"Sorry I meant more like hospitals, grocery stores more then offices."
Thx CenterPoint
That's my exact same situation. It's nonsense
"Welp, good to know not to get my hopes up based on everyone's responses. Will give it another few hours and then off to the in-laws I guess."
"That was a generic call that went out to just about everyone, not based on your actual location/timeline."
Are yall on a cruise ship or something
"Cypresswood and Cutten, nothing except some businesses. The rest of my complex has power but just not my building and a few others. "
"The Luby’s over there was open last night, not too busy with A/C it was heavenly!"
[deleted]
I used to live in the 15th and 22nd floor. I really liked the place. I never had any issues there. Other than the occasional elevator going out.
Yea I'm steadily losing hope on getting any sort of power
"Yes, me and my mom live in Westbury. Ours was back around noon and hers was up around 7. We're on opposite sides of Chimney Rock by W. Belfort."
"Fingers crossed that happens with me, but Lady Luck has never been my friend. "
My super hero of a Mom who has been dropping off ice for me said there were 3 Centerpoint tricks working in my area. Not sure exactly where you are but maybe that bodes well for us.
Kirby and main!
"We don’t even have a timeline expected yet and no crews have even looked in the area. Unfortunately, it was also like this with Uri as we were the last in the city to get back power."
"True. When I checked that map again after power returned, I was seeing all blue for my neighborhood instead of what I mentioned. Now the map is even more inaccurate assuming all my neighbors have power, too. It's hilarious."
The surrounding area in 77077 has all been lit up since Tuesday but it seems like a good amount of the residential areas are still powerless. I told myself I was gonna hold out until tonight but I can’t putter around my house with no power for another day.
The power has just come on in Ashford Forest on the side more towards Dairy Ashford about 10 minutes ago. Not sure how far that restoration extends geographically. It had been off since Monday ~8:15A.
Richmond Ave near Sanford Brown College!
Sending prayers. You should be back soon. Kroger is running on generator power if you need anything. They have a two bag limit for ice- got some this morning but not sure if they still have any.
Cypress Station and Westfield Place. Close to Lentz Park.
Is that available in their website?
Are you in a nested outage too? I drove by the heb in the area and it looked like it had power
"I know that this is another case of the rich taking advantage of those who aren't rich to get richer.
 These situations will keep happening for generations to come unless we start changing what we came into while we are here. 

I feel that when it comes to the states in our county, 
Texas is a good one when it comes to the citizens uniting to 
help one another if not the best. 

Maybe I need to start some type 
of gofundme or something to set me in the right direction of changing the fact that a company is leaving citizens of Texas without a necessity of life everytime a strong storm comes through.

We are complacent when the electricity is working and I'm guilty of that as well. 
We need to have the ability to reboot the whole grid within a 24 hour period. 
If that's impossible we need to make it possible. If it takes years that's fine too, but as of now, we are to vulnerable. 
A category 1 hurricane shouldn't be able to leave vast areas without power for this long. 
Maybe I'm delusional for feeling this. I just know our tax dollars are spent advancing wepons, but the power structures are the same ones that where here when I was born."
I don’t even know how’d I’d be acting with this level of transparency coupled with the heat. god give you patience and then some
I'm near North Braeswood and Chimney Rock. My parents would actually be in between where you and I are
That's what I was thinking. But management implied in an email that this is a Center Point issue... Can't trust em so who knows
"Still down. Emptying all the meat from the freezer and grilling it on the streets, shirtless like a caveman"
Yeah it's always worst for areas like that where people don't have an extra $600 in the seat cushions of their Lamborghinis for a generator and a window unit.
"Lol I usually run off to Katy too but they don't have power either. For what it's worth, Centerpoint sent a message that they are going to start work in 77057 ( or at least my street address) today"
"Pasadena and same story. Businesses are up, residential is down"
"That’s good to know, thanks for the info"
near Montrose and Westheimer
Calumet between Austin and La Branch
"Center points own repair guidelines have those <10 blackouts as dead last in priority.

I'd imagine wirh all the workers in town it'll snowball fairly fast at the end, but I'm expecting Friday at the earliest."
Thank you.
Really? Where are you exactly? I’m at village or cypress creek
Same. 77069/Champions - out since 6 am yesterday.
is the sterling still not up?
Me too!
"Yes still on in my building! The office did mention this morning that buildings 1, 2, and 3 were still out though"
Oh no 😟 
no literally im dying of heat and cant find gas anywhere. Idk if i can handle another full on day of this 🙃🙃
I can guarantee we have no power.  It has been out since Monday at 9:30am yet it says green on the CP map.  I have repeatedly submitted the address on the website.
Means someone has been assigned to work on it.
It’s all shit and inaccurate. I’m green but without power
Would add the the weatherhead is your property and if that is broken you have to hire an electrician to fix it.
"Thank you! Meter is dead and not receiving power and breaker is on (also reset it). Will check weatherhead, was not aware of its existence!"
[deleted]
"ours was marked green on the map, and the other side of the street was marked orange. the other side of the street got power back like mid yesterday. half of my side never lost power at all but we were all green on the map."
Thanks for the info!
Thank you so much!
I'm just north of that Southwells strip center
I am close to Cottage Groove park.
Confirmed that a few streets behind Parker have power but now sure how deep into the neighborhood before the power stops
Thank you! It brings some hope. I just pray that the upcoming storm doesn't push back restoration or knock the power out again
"Colony Creek, Louetta and Old Louetta"
Orangevale near Markridge
Colony Creek sub division
It is a good indicator as long as your home internet service is also working when the power comes back on. Comcast/Xfinity and AT&T have been able to get a lot of people back online already.
colony creek
Got it now.
hilcroft and ariel street down the street from herod elementary
they said we should get ours tomorrow? but seeing the lights flicker on tonight is hopeful… i wouldn’t pay attention to the map tbh so many people got power before expected
There was a big tree laying on a line in that area and they just removed it a couple hours ago. Yesterday the linemen there said that was causing the delay so hopefully it’ll be back soon
I'm just on the other side of cypresswood and am praying they're gonna get to us soon
"Ah, YES!  **YES!!**

I was SO hoping I'd see someone saying this today!"
We got power around 3:30!  YAY!!!
Yes got it Monday Night around 10PM
"West of Shepherd.  I have a family member on the Durham side of 26th, they are still without power :("
Apartment mgmt sent out an email after the fact. Our poor maintenance guy was trapped in an elevator.
Wow you think quite highly of them if you think they're using the best tape
"It's extremely disheartening driving by the tons and tons of office buildings and businesses with power, and 1 block over my entire neighborhood is suffering."
"Museum district, One Hermann Place."
Bellaire blvd and academy
I drove past there twice now. Where was this? Was it like leaning backwards or something?
"There’s been very little restoration reported today. Hell, there’s been more notice of people losing power. We’ll be lucky if they even get to the majority of the remaining people by Friday."
The area still had no power when I was there an hour ago
I apologize I’m not sure. I’ve been at my dad’s house in Katy the last 2 days. My place is right by Cleveland Park.
I’m able to connect to my smart home hub from my dad’s house in Katy so looks like internet is working.
Have you heard/seen any others with nested outages get power back?
"there are some people with generators around me, can hear buzzing, our roommate got his dad‘s generator so we can at least have the fridge on and a few fans! better than nothing"
I have my frig running on an extension cord so not sure what you mean by flip the breaker
Thanks so much!
"ugh, same… the complex right behind mine has power but my entire building is out afaik"
did yours come back? mine’s still out… I’ve lost hope atp
Near Fondren  Road
Best of luck and stay safe!
No cell service. Have to leave home to use phone at Walmart.
Cell service just came back up.
Thanks! Had to go elsewhere for power and AC.
[deleted]
I lost power around 6 am Monday. This is the longest we have lost power since freeze happened in Feb 2021.
"445am Monday here.  I saw a lot of progress on the ground this afternoon and trucks were staged at Clear Lake Park with several working on Kirby.  I saw where they had marked for repair in several spots so I assume they're moving quickly patching small things here and there now that lots of the trees are off lines so they can start throwing switches, but who knows.  Haven't seen any trucks since."
"nope, single family home"
Near White Oak and Norhill.
Good chunk of folks around Ashland/Waverly S of 11th still without power.
We are on Lawrence between 10th and 11th with no power since 9:30am yesterday.   I know someone near 7th and Rutland never lost power.
And his is back on again. He got his twice before mine once 2 streets over is actually kinda hilarious.
Helena & mcgowen!
"Once I login to my account on center point website, under my account, under electric service I have a status of power off/on…it changed back to off now :("
Is there power to Forum Park yet? The Whataburger app says the one on Bissonnet is alive today.
🥲🔫
Is there power to Forum Park yet? The Whataburger app says the one on Bissonnet is alive today.
"That littler corner had power already, but forum park does not"
"I’ve seen west and longenbaugh at 6
And longenbaugh at barker
But in between darkness"
I'm at west and highway 6 and my power is back on. 
North
I got that too but didn't stay on the line much longer after it said several days....nothing else I want to hear there...
HODL
Allen House! 
"> make sure to always connect your electronics to an outlet with a circuit breaker

\* surge protector :)"
Thank you for your reply!
Who would have expected that they get ONE thing right. I've been trying to stay calm but its day 4!!!!!
That gives me hope. I'm not far away from that on North Braeswood and Chimney Rock
"If it's just the assessment, we could be without power for a few more days..."
https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195bcf03ae0c491f9f14bf77f2c43420
Ty for the update 😭 the worst part is cell service is not accessible in that area . It’s spotty
Thanks for letting me know! I’m so stressed out 😭
It’s true! We are in the middle. On the left and right few blocks away got already their power. It’s very frustrating to see that we are left out 😩😭
Norchester is back as of ~20 min ago
"Between Wellby and the apartments down the road next to the Circle K, no.  Everything else is.  Lucky me, I happen to be on the circuit that's still dark."
Just got a message from my apartment management saying they’re anticipating it coming back soon due to areas close to ours getting power back. I’m really hoping this is good news.
I think a 4th grade unpaid intern did it for a summer project. It's laughable.
"Hmmm. Not really? I'm not necessarily going out of the way to check specific area. I'm just staying with some friends, while waiting for my power to get on in 77008. I just went to go check on my dad in 77088 while I was out. But if someone lists something and I happen to pass through or nearby, I'm happy to update!"
"I also only got an automated message, it only told me that they were aware of my outage."
You’re right but some communication from CP would be nice.
I got changed from green to blue…
"Hi neighbor, I noticed it during work earlier and asked in the the Day 5 Megathread with hopeful thoughts that it had returned. Nope. Any updates in the last hour?"
"The log, forgot to link: https://holmosapien.com/centerpoint/"
This was just an email from their PowerAlert nonsense…all of my calls resulted in their automated system.
East!! I'm sorry and 77008!! Beverly st
Thank you! Hope everyone can get their power back as soon as possible! 🙏
"Still dark here in Champions Point Village.  Still seeing Wednesday on the map.  Ah, well, at least that's only a few days off."
"We got power right around 3:30 this afternoon.

Ran home, turned off that trusty generator and switched back over to grid power.  HUGE relief!"
"Same for us. Internet was available as soon as the power was restored. We have AT&T Fiber. Since we had a cut electric line on my street I was worried, but the fiber appears to be on a higher line than the electricity."
"Yeah got xfinity back saturday, 5 days after the power. Same thing happened after the derecho. I pulled the trigger on fiber. I can keep xfinity at the lowest tier and save enough to make it the same money in total. I’d put it off until now because the xfinity internet is fast when it works and I didn’t like the idea of ATT drilling a hole into my house but now I’m done."
"You are the sweetest! We also got hotel rooms but they were hard to find and no availability past Thursday morning. Estimate power restoration is July 19th but I saw trucks drown northpark removing some of the trees from the power lines. Sending you all the hugs. We got this. My dad is at a senior community here and they have no power so I’ll have to bring him with us. I feel so bad for the other people, some are over 100 years old."
[deleted]
"damn,  this is ridiculous.  fuck centerpoint with a cactus."
I just mean that the technology shouldn’t be so creaky that they don’t even know what they’ve fixed and what they haven’t. That sort of thing is a bit unsettling to say the least.
"I drove to the Galleria, Pasadena, Sawyer Park, and back to Montrose and only saw one line worker truck the entire time. Kind of ridiculous."
E Richey from Hardy toll road to Aldine Westfield had no power from what I can tell.
"Yup you are just down the road from me, I'm in Kleinbrook. There is that pole down in front of the Tim Hortons, I think that's our problem. And they won't even send anyone to look at it. I can see the damn thing from my house all day and night. Only time they did anything to it was Wednesday morning when they took it out the road and moved it to the median. "
Near West and Jackrabbit
We get through discount power but they ounted it to center point.
Envious of you - what’s that zip? Bc still got no power here in 77056 by Richmond and chimney rock
"That’s good, I’m glad you got to a place with power!! I’m sweating my extremities off in my room, and I slept for so long yesterday that I’m afraid i’ll be up until sunrise… hopefully power is restored soon"
I also have no power still! Though i heard my friend in Montrose (near HEB on dunlavy) has power now. I am assuming it’s just random at this point :( cause also friends in the strip of Richmond near Kirby and Greenbriar has power as well. 😭
Thanks! Very helpful!
The address is still very legible btw
"might want to take this down like u/DonTitoh said your address is very legible.  
Also don't want to be a debbie downer but I received that message at 3 AM last night and our power wasnt restored until 9 AM today but it's still a good sign!"
"Seriously. I’ve driven by the power plant on Rustic Woods a couple times hoping it’s back up. If so, then it’s a matter of time before Kingwood gets restored. But…nothing yet. 🙁"
"Bay Forest. We lost it on Monday about 8AM
Edit: we’re Bay Forest not Brook Forest"
"Fat fingered it, we’re in Bay Forest."
[deleted]
Actually saw a few parked in the AutoZone parking lot off Cavalcade. They used that lot as a staging area for the derecho so they are out there. Someone posted earlier that they had power restored around Dan Electro’s. Hoping it comes both of our ways soon!
">  the uncool side of Midtown 

All sides are pretty uncool right now, to be fair. ;) ;)"
Brother if you're sitting in A/C right now I'd make the opposite argument about who is cool!
What street are you on? I’m also on the other side of Midtown/288.
I have to imagine that’s an old alert and their power alert system is just shitty. No chance it took that long to assess damage
I’m on west Dallas and mine’s back
"In the fourth ward area, close to Gray"
It is for me
Fourth ward area- close to gray
Same! I’m on La Rue. 
Thank you. I live at San Filipe and S.Voss so I should be good.
"I'm off of Westheimer and Greenridge, I will keep hope alive!"
"The builders of the stupid house made them non openable. Believe me, we tried. We have them in the coolest part of the house and I am checking on them every 30 minutes "

"Sorry, 1900 block of Prospect St."
Still nothing on Southmore & San Jacinto
"Not a damn blip of electricity side Monday morning. I saw a CenterPoint truck yesterday but that hasn’t seemed to do anything. With all the lights and AC around us, I’m feeling forgotten."
Hopefully tonight or tomorrow 
Darn. Welp.. thank you!
Near Woodway and Bering!
"That’s around when ours turned on, so maybe it was because they were messing with the lines. I’m so done from the past few days I don’t even wanna get too excited, but if anything I’m just excited to get some air flow in here. Congrats fellow 77057-er"
Hi! Any updates on power for 77459 in sienna?
Mine has been out since power came on at 6pm. Is yours still out? It's 10:45pm now. 77006.
"There are some pockets of green in the Woodlands area now, but still a lot of work to be done. https://www.etrviewoutage.com/map?state=TX

In tonight's detailed Entergy update, they didn't even list an estimated date of completion for the Woodlands area (while all their other areas got a date), because of the substantial damage to transmission lines and substations in that area. https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/lcg88m0/"
Oh thank you! I love hearing this. But I’m a sucker for getting my hopes up 😅 fingers crossed this nightmare is over for us all very soon 
[deleted]
I am in the same zip with no power
I know right… map shows green however that is BS. They are showing more areas that have power to cover their ass…
Do you know the crossroads?
I live in nottingham apartments. Is it back there
I tried calling.  Automated message says they can’t take any calls and to call back later.
Appreciate that thank you will be calling
What if my apartment complex is neither coded green nor orange ( blue)? We don’t have power 😔
"Now they added a new status ""Energized with potential nested outage."" without clear indication where those nests are."
Kirkwood and Grove West Blvd
omg jk my house still doesn’t lollll
We were half way to San Antonio when we got the news so we only heard because our neighbors updated us ha
how is it now?
Cool. Hopefully that's what is connected to Rayford houses between Kuykendahl and Gosling
Did they give you any info or timeline when you called?
Thanks for checking in! I hope we get it really soon here.
"Yup that’s exactly what happened for the 2nd time today. It’s back offline again. Shortly after it came back up, my CenterPoint account switched to “power on”, and I got an email from them saying issue was resolved. Then about 20 minutes later it went back offline and I got another email from centerpoint saying they’re aware of the outage. I’m just going to hang tight until tomorrow and it’s back on for at least a couple hours."
Whittington/Dairy Ashford
Thank you for the encouraging words! I don’t know how late they work or when they stop for the night but I’m winding down for another night downstairs with my fan and power bank🥲 at least it isn’t scorching hot tonight I guess
It’s so weird!
Willowbend and Atwell
Tip of third ward…This is a shit show
Wind River park boss
Thanks a lot.  I'm looking at a guy in a bucket repairing the only line I can see left over here off of Bayview in El Lago.  I can feel it.
It’s so shitty that they say everyone will have a restoration date but don’t give dates for nested outages
Cartwright and 1092 I'm right next to qvms
"For me, it's cartwright and la Quinta. Had no power last night. Still a big chunk in that area without power."
"Okay, I am Palm Grove Dr and 1092, so i’ll be watching for y’all’s updates. Hoping end of day today for us all 🤞🏾"
"Even when you did get through, did it seem to help or alert them to something they were not aware of? I’ve just assumed that I’m at the bottom of the list so I haven’t bothered calling. But I’m getting desperate. Maybe I should just give in and embrace this nomadic 19th century life. 😢"
Thanks for the heads up. You saved me a call. I guess I’ll just wait until Monday.
Yes. It's been running solid for about an hour now.
Dudes are heroes. As shit as CP has been nobody should ever take it out on these dudes. They look so wiped and they're still gearing up for a whole night of work.
"My office is on 18th, and we've had power since Wednesday. Hope you're back up and running soon."
So sorry. Any updates on when it will be back on?
Thanks for the luck friend. We just got power back at 7:10pm! I hope now everyone in 77007 is back online
Memorial and Briar Forest.
mine luckily came back a few hours later... man this is ridiculous
Which neighborhood?
I have Texas new Mexico power.  Pearland
"i feel like i’ve reached a sort of haze at this point. i can’t sit still because of how uncomfortable i am, so i slowly pace from spot to spot trying to find a way to make myself less miserable for a few minutes at a time. it wouldn’t be so bad if i could get a break in my car with some AC but i’m almost out of gas! 😭"
"that’s what’s getting to me right now. if i could just get gas, i could sit in my car AC or go looking for ice. anything besides just sitting and stewing in my apartment."
unfortunately only able to stay long enough to charge. the night is not forgiving indoors!
Ah! Thank you!
Why is cnp removing tree debris? The city can’t organize people to help with that?
harmony neighborhood off rayford rd! all the way at the end of it almost
hopefully soon for you! they fixed the traffic lights and a lot of the surrounding neighborhoods today. if not today i'm sure by tomorrow.
are you 77386 or not?
So lucky 
Coworker who after we both quit used to hang out have a beer or two on weekends. One time he came over and helped me fix my patio pergola and helped me build a desk. I know where he lives but I guess he's more of an acquaintance
That's good to know!
Same. Came on briefly and then went back out.
"No, tidwell/45"
Same! Does anyone know if centerpoint works throughout the night trying to restore power?
[deleted]
We’re on Augusta and Burgoyne and we just got power back like an hour ago.
36778.
36778. 
Ut housing is not colored so what does it mean
"That's horrifically slow, but no, it won't go faster if they are doing the same work on circuits that serve fewer people, which I think is what they're doing."
"Na, they restored lightly damaged grid first so their number looks good. Now they move on to moderate to heavy damaged grid."
Near the Dairy Ashford roller rink
I’m away from home right now and AT&T is reporting a service outage so I don’t know
"It's back, at least for some of that area.  Given the timing it almost certainly is for you too."
Got power about 39 min ago!
You at the Camden too? Lol I am suffering here and see the whole building next to us with power 😭😭
"Yeah, the entire session, aldi to jack in the box, has power now"
House but there’s a small apartment complex across from me that had power back way before I did
Ooooo any update on our area?
:// dammit
this is the worst thing I’ve read today
"Giant trees around a substation, what could go wrong?!"
I haven’t heard anything. They said that power to Middlebrook closer to Bay Area blvd was restored first. I am a little further down so I guess that Brook Forest would be next but I’m just speculating.
Yeah I was walking around the green belt and it seems like people on the west side of the canal have power but not the east.
Not surprised. Can't rely on them for anything
[deleted]
Do you have a neighbor you check with? Or can you look at Nextdoor?
43rd/Antoine area
What part of 77498?
Philippine and beltway
"i can say for sure that some areas along Westheimer Rd are doing better now, but that's all i can really say. sorry i don't have more info"
"That’s where I’m at, and I have power. Hoping you do too when you get home!"
Thanks! We’ve got power back but no internet. Xfinity outage is here to stay for now.
im not on a cross but im on mason ! by creech elementary !
"I'm in the 5 day zone, just south of the Park Falls pool."
Thank you for the update. Too bad 😏
"77389 here, there are at least two lines down from trees in our neighborhood.  Haven't seen any CP trucks except a couple at the home depot @ kuykendahl and grand parkway this morning.  lots and lots of trees down around here.  I got an email saying be prepared to be without power for several days."
Agree.  My parents are in 77379 and I am worried about them.
i’m new to spring area (klein area near kuykendahl) does it usually take this long?
West of Oxford st
"Centerpoint has a new map posted here, https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195bcf03ae0c491f9f14bf77f2c43420 , which I hadn't seen until tonight. It is *not* getting live updates, and has major inconsistencies. Better than nothing, though."
"The fact that this happens in Houston of all fucking places baffles me. It's completely out of our hands, thats the worse part about it."
"I feel for you, my mom lives at Bellaire and Hillcroft and she has power back."
"I'm right next to Jane Long High, and I have only seen centerpoint once. Yesterday, at around 11am a guy came by to ask to see the electrical post that's in our backyard, and since then I have not seen a single crew doing work in our block. Fuck centerpoint. No updates since then."
🫂
What even is this emoticon
Yay Reddit
During the May storms when they got me back online after 5 days it was showing as on right away at like 6:30PM.
"Just north of 43rd, in the block immediately west of Ella."
"According to my ring camera, it looks like we have power back. "
"My grid seems to be the neighborhoods immediately on the west side of the beltway at Fallbrook, and branches out to the businesses immediately on the east side of the beltway"
"Yes, it is."
Hang in there neighbor. 77070 too. Been hearing people getting power back since yesterday and just got ours back 2 hours ago. You guys will probably be up next. By tonight.
Like on main st in midtown
I live there! My husband says we do.
Sadly sounds par for the course. Not a lick of power for me either so I feel your pain
Areas south of greens bayou seem to be lit while the northern end is dead
"They can kill ppl and get away with it. Someone throws put at their building, I guarantee it will be time in jail and a hefty fine."

Brilliant
"I’ve been trying to help my wife from stressing too much so that has kept me preoccupied.  Hope you have family/friends to spend time with.  Not healthy to feel islanded, a bit like getting evicted from your own home.  [Hang in there](https://www.pinterest.com.mx/pin/826692075320356811/)."
"Oh sweet!  I’ll take any glimmers of hope.  Yes I’m Teal and north of woodway.  Tanglewood PD sent a message last night saying workers would be in the area so I hope our circuit is at least being looked at.

My wife and I said if power comes on tonight we are staying up all night and partying 😂."
The map updated and it looks like our circuit (assuming we are on the same one) is supposed to be fixed today!  Fingers crossed.
Yeah I had to take this whole week off cause I didn’t have power 😭
August? I refuse to believe this. That's outrageous 
Just got an email from CP saying July 19th now.
Fingers crossed for you!!!
I did through the emergency line yesterday
I think it means we're after blue which they are currently on.
Same. My whole street isn't colored at all.
"It means once they do street-level repairs, which is the last step, yall will be good to go. I'm in the same boat. It would be more exciting news if I had seen even one CP truck today."
It means Centerpoint has started repairs in your area.

"i had completely lost faith, hang in there"
Get a top sheet damp and lay under it. Evaporation is a very effective at cooling. I was literally shivering and I was smiling so hard to be cold lmao
Have you got any updates at all now? I’m trying to sign up for the stupid power alert service and not sure if it’s even worth it 
Comcast/Xfinity also out for a month after Ike.
"Look at the legend again, they changed what the colors mean.... blue is basically the new orange. Atp if you were in a priority area you have power, everyone else doesn't move the headlines much so we will be waiting until they can spare the time smh"

"Via text and email.
I’ve signed up for their PAS (power alert system I think).
They hardly send any updates but if you like you can sign up for it [here](https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/)

There’s a link at the bottom on that page.
Still no power btw."
"Yeah, we're right below Brookside village.   
Got power back yesterday 9AM and then power went out again today around 1:45PM and now thankfully have had power back since 4:15PM."
Im by westheimer and Montrose. Its patchwork rn. I haven’t had power since yesterday around 10:00 but I see blocks around me with power
"I’m in the same area, I really thought we made it through unscathed. We had power until probably 10:30 yesterday then it just flickered and disappeared during a lull in the storm."
Near 249 and fiesta! It came on around 4am
"What part of 77070? I’m near Woodedge and Jones rd and no power..
*update we finally got power around noon!!!"
Same here friend Lakewood Forest area.  No power.
Bruh yes wtffff
im about to start crying😭
Im right by there. No power yet
Hope it bounced back.  My area was only out again for another 20 minutes or so
"They updated the map to 7/19 possible for power. I spoke to a couple people at Centerpoint. There’s a breaker issue, line repair, and tree damage they have to get through. But they have sent people to look so maybe they’ll get it up and running sooner. I’m off of Antoine and long point."
"yeah I live in heritage park right behind clear brook HS, a friend in the next neighborhood down got power at the same time but another friend across the street from me still doesn't have it even now, so hopefully they cover it soon :/"
Why do they hate us :(
I wish that was it! But thanks for the tip
we thug it out no problem
There was one second of power like 5am I think and that's it 😭
"I just left before that to go into the office, I really hope our power is back on in 77019 by the Whole Foods (a third of our townhome neighbors never lost power)."
Next to Town & Country.
"Yes, large power companies usually do. It helps to locate damage in areas they can't see from the street."
Mostly for morale.
"Still no power, no updates from Centerpoint either"
I’m at buffalo speedway and Richmond and I’m still waiting on power 😭
By whole foods
There has been no line to get in when I have gone 
West lake is starting to get power back. Not us yet but hopeful!!!!
south main by the dunkins
"Same for us. Looking at their map, it says my block hasn’t been assessed yet"
same I'm in 77498 and our entire apartment complex is out still but the neighborhood behind us has power. ughhhhhh
I see some house lights on in the neighborhoods around mine so I believe they have power
"We saw Centerpoint pickup trucks around 3, and the guys had clipboards.  So clearly not here to fix anything, and just assessing.  Not holding out much hope for today, and we lost power around 3am Monday."
"FM 1092 and Highway 6, by Lowes"
I wish they’d communicate that… they do have a messaging system that people sign up for after all
I’m by Mead Middle School on Lauder still no power ):
Myself right now. Seems like my street is the only one still without power
"I know we’ve seen yesterday that some of our area got already power and businesses are open! We thought our power will on yesterday but, it wasn’t! Very disappointing and frustrating 😞"
Around 12pm
boy i hope so being a blue surrounded by a sea of greens.
It’s crazy how with the lack of communication we don’t even know if they have night shifts
would you be able to let me know when the power does come back on? my grandma lives around there and she is currently staying with me and is itching to go back home lol
"I work in Midtown and we never lost power but my home did. Meh, at least i was only hot at night, i guess."
I think we should be part of the same circuit. Hopefully we get at the very least an update soon.
"Yep, they're slowly but surely making they're way over to us. Definitely hoping for power or at least an estimate soon."

Thanks for replying!
Do you happen to know if they’ve worked at all on the downed power line from in front of Tim Horton’s?
I won't divulge any further location information other than that sorry.
77044 off c e king pkwy
[deleted]
It came back on shortly after
Which neighborhood please?
near Grant and N. Eldridge
Same when I went yesterday for ice
Just checked ATT app and we are online- can't wait to go home. Thanks for the suggestion!
Thanks 😊 Does that mean we have hope for tonight?
Also in Copper lakes myself. We saw a Centerpoint truck drive through about an hour ago.
one outlet is working in the bathroom on that side while the other outlets in all bedrooms aren't working. so is that the power company issue or something wrong with my house?
"They aren’t there anymore, but fingers crossed that we get power tonight. "
Our apartment complex in their nightly update told us that when they tried restoring power yesterday that the transformer blew. So I’m assuming they already knew about it
My apartment complex just texted me it’s back on! Gonna drive over there soon and verify!!!
"No power, still :C"
"Tons of trucks in the neighborhood.  Lots of bucket trucks and Trees, Inc trucks.  Fingers crossed."
"I have friends near the elementary school who have power, so hopefully not too long 🤞"
That's where I'm at as well. Fingers crossed we get it soon! I'm just exhausted.
Do you still not have power??
"Me too, 3/4 buildings have power. Weird af"
Same area. Drove north into champions from Grant. Seems like no one has power and didn’t see any signs of work being done.
"Fuck, man. That's right near me. I didn't see any trucks earlier either. We were able to get ice yesterday at HEB at Louetta. Might try to get a hotel I'd I can even find one that's not astronomical."
Fingers crossed still no power. Beltway and Richmond
? Do you know if Walnut bend has power?
I live on Holly Hall Street and still no power ☹️
"I live closeby and didn't have power when I went to work this morning. No updates from my apartment yet, so we'll see when I get home. A few apartment complexes nearby had lights on when I went for a walk last night. I'll update when I get home!"
I have friends near Almeda who managed to retain power through the storm. I got a message from Centerpoint warning that we ( not sure if it was directed to me) may not have power for several days.
I’m right behind Rudy’s BBQ. 59 and Grand Parkway
"No good news, I’m afraid"
my power ended up coming back on at 7:20pm yesterday !!
So sad 😥
Oh god. That's terrible.
It basically said same thing others have posted here that they have completed their assessment and due to the severity they are focusing on essential personnel so it might take several days for power to be restored.  Not sure if they are cycling through everyone or its targeted…seems too advanced for center point to target specifically.
God I hope that’s me soon I got about 3 seconds of power an hour ago and then immediately dead again 😭 Mason and highland knolls
Around bering/woodway
"Possibly, some traffic lights were on and some weren't, so its still been kind of random unfortunately"
Yeah our area got power back around 330 pm then lost power 15 minutes after and has been out since. What a fucking tease ugh. Hopefully they're still working in 77407.
Thank you - so sorry it’s not on - thankfully we’re at sine families who have power I couldn’t made it otherwise.
[Crayon Map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195bcf03ae0c491f9f14bf77f2c43420)
You should never have to ask that for such a critical public facing map or chart. It's damn basics to show the legend immediately instead of hiding it behind an on-map popup.

"We stayed at the Marriott in Texas Medical Center. Booked the room Monday afternoon for Tuesday night only. Got really lucky it seems - I don’t think I would have been able to keep the room if I tried to extend the stay, every place was booked out when I tried to do that Tuesday afternoon 😔"
"was watching ch2 news and they had a reporter out at the staging area for about 50 trucks still parked at 7am, help is coming today finally"
We were suppose to stay near west branch area for a travel baseball tournament which for whatever reason they aren’t cancelling lol thank you for letting me know
Yep. I see power across the street from me too. What a bunch of nonsense
This sucks
"I'm in the exact same situation, still. It's unbelievable"
Appreciate that. Fingers stay crossed
HEb MacGregor
Blessings. I’m hoping tonight is the night because morale is low in the household.
"Unfortunate, but thanks so much!"
Fuck. This shit seriously sucks
Is the power still out? :( Thanks in advance!
Thank you! I’m in carrington apartments and we still don’t have power someone said maybe Thursday or Friday but the radio today said everyone will be up and running Sunday
"Thank you thank you thank you! Like I said, I know this is a minor concern in the big scheme of things, but I'm feeling a little overwhelmed right now, so THANK YOU for taking the time to respond and make me feel a bit more reassured!"
Thanks so much!
but this is insanity.
"Oh damn! I'm glad I told them a very big ""Thank you for your hard work!"""
Thank you!
"Good god. That at least worked last time. 

So I could have power and not even know it.

Great stuff"
It’s getting worst now that it’s raining! For sure nobody will going to fix it! 😭😩 I’m so drained 😩
Dang.
thanks
Power is on. My fear is returning and the power goes out again. 
Yeah. My dad and brother went by and said we were still out.
"Well, I may have spoken too soon. Most things are powered but the meter shows no numbers and not all appliances (including AC) are working"
I just checked my house and power is still off
"I’m just hoping with time that we’ll all be able to look back on this and laugh, but I’m too bitter for all that right now."
Omy! I am so sorry. Life really kicks us in the balls sometimes. I hope things get easier and your power is on soon.
Where are you located
They’re fixing two downed lines near highway 6 and memorial drive
Fucking same! I'm already looking 
You can do that???? Thanks man your really smart my hopes are saved for keeping bugs away
Felt that! Still no power as of 6am
"So weird, I typically don’t lose power either haha"
"I hope it’s back before the sun is up, cause the streets are looking eerie"
South Rice and Braeswood.
"Yes, loading the house with cold air in case it drops again."
"No idea, that's considerably south of us."
Thank you! And so glad you have power back ☺️
Same here friend! Patiently waiting :/
Sierra Vista. Hopefully that means y'all are getting it back soon!
👍
I hope that's the case
"Hey neighbor, I’m down the street from the park going towards McGowen. Still nothing since Monday morning"
fingers crossed for us both! Kind of losing faith though and becoming very negative
"Nope, I got yesterday's message too and it was different. Instead of cleaning up vegetation it had some verbage about hospitals, police and firefighters first, followed by the usual blah blah blah and continue to be prepared to be without power for a few days.  The excuses keep changing."
Down the road which side?
Does the restoration map still show “pending review” for your address? The area around Chesire and TC Jester appears to be connected to my address around 43rd and Watonga on the restoration map. Happy to know some neighbors are getting it back!
"Meadowglen I think? (I’m bad with streets)

I do live pretty close to that Target though 

Thanks for response!"
"Yeah got it this afternoon. Just the general ""we're expecting it to be on by end of day tomorrow"" thing but it JUST clicked back on after no power since 5am Monday! So if you're by me you should hopefully be getting it soon."
yeah! that one
I don’t think that’s it. I think it’s only a handful of like 6 houses that were out. Everyone else in the neighborhood has power.
I don't know how it is at Gaston & Fry - I live in Falcon Ranch and we haven't had power for days.
"Just heard back. only a mile away from there and still out of power… iirc, that area has had power since tuesday. fml"
Same here 😭
It's back on Holly Hall St between Almeda and 288 for sure because I can see my doorbell camera is working again
It just came back!
"Penwood way and South wayside drive, West of I45"
Haha seriously?
Hope your power comes back on soon!
"I'm seeing ""We will continue to provide estimated restoration times as they become available"" -- near Cleaveland Park, 77007."
Next status level is “assessments confirmed”
We must be in the unlucky half of buildings. Guess this is karma of some kind for getting power back earlier in the derecho than the others.
Thanks
"Thanks. I called the customer service line and pressed 1 for emergency or downed line. Got to a person in about 3 minutes. Told them our business has had no power for 6 days, it shows it's energized but it's not. She was nice, but basically said she put an update in the system and that's all she can do and they'll get to it as fast as they can. Coincidentally, I got an alert from the alarm at work that power was restored within 2 minutes of hanging up the phone, lol!!"
Ok well I was told Monday so…
I'm by 249/99 and we got nothing.
Thats good to know. I havent seen any centerpoint in my side of 84 but if you say they are here Ima keep the faith. Heres to hoping that we are apart of the 1 mil that should have power back by tomorrow night.
Thank you so much for the update!
by hwy6 and i-10. half my apartment complex has power lol. the power grid did me dirty…
1.2 miles to Target on 8500 Main St
1.2 miles to Target on 8500 Main St
"I work in rice village so was curious, thank you so much."
">  Fridge and ac thermostat circuit breakers keep trippin tho

Sounds like her power is only half-working, literally. There's been a few other commenters in that situation. One of the incoming power lines is working and the second line isn't, basically. If she can get through to Centerpoint, that is a situation worth reporting to them, since they might not be able to remotely tell the difference between fully-working and half-working."
"Appreciate it. I'm originally from North Texas, so I'm used to heat.
But the heat down here just hits different "
Negatory. I’m over this
Update: A dangerously low power line has been fixed overnight. First sign I've seen in our neighborhood of centerpoint; hoping for power tonight but I'm not gonna hold my breath on that.
Thank you for the update.
Had a flicker but seems to be good now.
Still waiting:/ we’re a little ways east of Hillcroft
Oh I know how frustrating it’s been to see adjacent neighborhoods getting power over the last few days. Hang in there I’m sure you’ll be next!!
And it's raining again 😑
"Line something had a blue and teal emblem like an ""s"" shape. I was too busy cheering em on I forgot to look real close."
Update: Map now shows restoration by end of 7/16. Fuck you again Centerpoint.
"Hadn't thought of that. Those rotten bastards. LOL

Thanks for letting me know."
Let them vent. What else is there to do at this point? It's exasperating.
"I'm in 77021, and we still got no power. Our neighbors across the street have power though smh"
My power came back on around 1 a.m. last night so there’s at least some work happening overnight.
I saw a centerpoint truck near my neighborhood on my way home from work around 2 AM this morning.
"Simply, it is dangerous and difficult to work at night because of reduced light. All it takes is one lineman death working during the night and then suddenly no one wants to work during the night."
Hunters glen 2
here’s hoping. it’s so rough man.
I ended up getting power today at like 10am

"> CenterPoint's outage map was down for the first 36ish hours after hurricane Beryl hit

I recall it being down since the derecho ..."
"It seems like that at least were/are planning on improving resiliency, so they've found some incentive in improvements.

https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/centerpoint-extreme-weather-plan-19421019.php

>The largest chunk of CenterPoint’s proposal is for $1.45 billion to replace and upgrade assets most susceptible to severe weather. The utility wants to spend another $215 million to modernize its grid with new technology that could, for example, isolate outages to the fewest number of customers possible by rerouting power along a disrupted line, Wilson said.

>CenterPoint also proposed nearly $550 million in investments to implement flood control measures, such as elevating substations; improve security at critical substations; monitor cybersecurity risk; enhance vegetation management; and expand its wildfire mitigation strategies through covering conductors, undergrounding power lines and installing cameras and remote monitoring technology.

>The utility’s plan includes two pilot projects. One would study, design and operate a program observing the performance of utility-scale microgrids, localized grids that can disconnect from the main grid, during extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Another would pay a Houston city employee to oversee the implementation of projects related to power resiliency and energy efficiency. 

I don't disagree with your points re: regulation or municipality owned power.  I would, though, be very concerned with letting the average Houston electrician touch anything remotely related to a high voltage line connected to my home"
Yeah fr. Also Ike was very close to being a cat 3. Beryl was nowhere near as bad as Ike lol
The power infrastructure is more fragile now. There are as many households (2+ million) in the Houston metro currently without power as there were after Ike blew through.
Their map sucks.  It will say green when in actuality there is no power.  Happened numerous times the last year.  All people are asking for is honest communication
Especially since 22 hours ago he was posting his zip code asking for info because he’s “dying here”
Hope he keeps his sources to himself and not burn them.
"Sounds like the scale of this is MUCH bigger than they are letting on.
The complete silence from them is unnerving. Even if not relevant to me, messages like yours at least reduce some uncertainty."
"but i notice in my area, the businesses have power(HEB, whataburger, etc.) first. it's the just residential areas that don't have power or get it later on. it's definitely selective."
[deleted]
May I ask what part of 7709(?
[deleted]
Equally grateful for their comment. Have been worried sick the last few hours of them having to struggle with the heat but they have what they need too.
I’ve also been worried about my cats but I’ve been doing research and apparently they prefer temperatures in the 80s and are fine in the low 90s. They start to have problems around 100 F.
Any update? I live in the City Park apartments right off T C Jester and am hoping power will be on when I get off work
"Welcome to Houston buddy. Stay for the food, try to survive the mosquitoes, crazy drivers, horrid infrastructure, the unending heat, or the deluge of storms"
YOU HAVE A BEACH HOUSE IN CAPE MAY?!?
"Naw, while there are electric stoves there are definitely gas stoves too. Just depends on where you are, where your place was built, etc. Gas is way better than electric, obvs, just depends on location. Also fuck Philly, maybe you won't get heatstroke but no one assholes quite like a Philadelphian"
"I could but only if everything is 'OK'. If it's too hot, I need to help cool the pets. If we have the generator running, then we have 1 ac going and I feel ok leaving for a while. But. If it starts to rain, it's not in a covered area, so I need to shut it off and cover it. I can see doing half days if can stay close, so we'll just have to see."
One building is a T shape and the I has power but the -‐ does not. No street dividing the buildings with or without power though.
"I’m over there too, when are we getting power seriously, I can barely breathe 😭"
"Theyre obviously trying to turn on “richer” neighborhoods ex (river oaks, etc)"
"Make sure you take the car on some drives during the day (at least 15 minutes; the longer the better) if you're running it stationary so much for AC. Cars can't fully recharge the car battery on their own when they aren't moving, so you can eventually end up with a dead battery."
Not the storm cause how tf EVERYONE that HAD power don’t anymore. They trying to fckn save money for the week
"That’s better than I could ask for, thank you so much!"
2 left. 2 more still here but we dont see anyone in the truck?
That's really close to me. This is excellent.
"That’s sad. I’ve become addicted to just refreshing every 5 minutes, slowly losing sanity as the number hasn’t been changing 😞"
The odd part is that there is little to no damage in a good 5 mile radius of around 77040 and nothing...
"Oh man, please - I'm west of Shepherd, but hopefully that means we're soon."
"We are back up in 77007. In the Heights, South of 11th, West of Yale."
Yes!
KT - what’s the apt complex? And congrats!
Are there any more hotels in Galveston with rooms? I’m in pearland and I have a hotel for tomorrow but tonight will be ass otherwise. I have called a few hotels but all lines sound busy or won’t answer 
Can you provide a cross street? I’m between Hillcroft & Chimney Rock.
Tuckerton/BarkerCypress area. Still out currently
is it on where y’all at?? i’m 77096 and my shit was off since 8 am and i don’t know if it’s on cause i’m not even at my crib anymore cause shit was getting wicked dark asl and loud ass bangs and i seen a fire across the street
"Ah, darn."
:( I’m sorry. I hope you get AC soon
"Uh-oh, Centerpoint might have finally caught on that too many people had found their temporary link. It had been working for the last couple days since someone first leaked the link in an earlier reddit thread, and it was working the last time I looked at it around noon, but it is indeed completely offline now."
"Been through Harvey, that’s a cat 4 sitting on top of Houston for days. Yet I didn’t lose power for more than 48 hours. Now I’m expecting to lose power for 120+ hours. Anyone with half a brain cell could tell beryl is a lot weaker than Harvey. It’s not the hurricane, it’s center point. In the past 4 years I haven’t seen trees near power line getting trimmed. Now center point complaining about fallen trees and branches knocking down power and slow down repair. Well no shit."
"I know its crazy but if push comes to shove, going to costco and chilling there may not be too bad. Its a built in refrigerator with food and water."
[deleted]
"Yay, checking in from the apartments across from Perry's. It's 90 degrees in here 
 :( "
I don’t understand the grid shit
Same boat 😭😭
"Thats the initial map, you've gotta swipe through to the most current one"
Me thinks that not every area has an official ETA assigned to it. Mine doesn't provide any ETA either
yeah it's so doomed for us lmfao
"It confuses me too, but when I called, the representative said that they would note the number of calls for the area. They told me that they were waiting for a work crew to be assigned to our area. 

This morning, someone else from the zip code called; she posted that CNP said a crew had been assigned and that people should call back if there weren’t crews in our area within 4 hours."
Centerpointless doesn't want to pay them to work at night.
From what I've seen it's not the entire area. I'm on Hollister and only the East side has power unfortunately.
"You are completely misunderstanding. A ""state of emergency"" just gives the state or local government extra powers to restrict people's movements/activities, it doesn't have anything to do with funding (edit: or with getting other kinds of help from FEMA). The affected cities/counties are already gathering data on damages now, and they will only be eligible for additional federal assistance funds if the total amount of damage they can document exceeds certain thresholds."
Awesome! Thank you so much for the update!
We have power back officially at our house now too (in 77354)! I really appreciate you remembering to come back and update me! Stay safe!
Nope. I'm by 249/99 and nothing yet.
I’m positive. They work at night.
Will do so as well.  Hope you’re hanging in there.  At least it seems like each day there is forward progress.
"this is where I live too, extremely disheartening"
On hargrave off cypresswood. A multiple power lines knocked over.
Above or below the Bayou? If you don’t mind me asking! Because all the 77096 restorations has been south of the Bayou (we’re north of it 😣)
I think many people in the area got it back today. Did you have any luck?
I talked to center point  two days ago and they told me EOD yesterday. I then I got that notification to my email. I still don't have power. Idk what to believe but I'm preparing my mind for Friday.
"Fair enough, that’s a solid point
I’m sure there are ways to build that can make things cooler

Plus we humans added all this concrete, I believe that helps to heat the area to a certain degree, or hold the heat at least"
We can be miserable together I guess :D
"I now have hope , I’m returning from Austin , hopefully everything will be up by tonight"
Checked on the new outage map. They haven’t even started.
You’re a saint for helping out where you can! Started getting worried about the cat too. Luckily our power just came back on and I wish everyone gets theirs soon.
Just 5 min north of Cottage Groove!
If I could work from home I would. We've got a big construction site generator providing power for everything except lights and air conditioning. Temp gauge on my desk says it is 86F and 65% Humidity.
Hopefully it'll be back on tonight. My brother's had seemingly been restored but then was back off again for 6 hours before being fully restored. 🤞🍀
Thank u for the update！I'm heading home again 😂
Plz lord 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
"Hate to ask again but I just got a group of texts from Centerpoint stating we had power, then confirming an issue, then saying issue resolved. Do you have power?"
Holy crap power just came back on about 10 minutes ago 😭😭😭
There is no way. I’m sorry.
But only for a year at a time (when utilizing fuel stabilizer)
Dude I know. It’s SO freaking heavy. Thank GOD my husband helped me with ours before he went to work. He said it is absolutely POURING over by 610 and the Galleria. It’s supposedly moving towards Spring Branch/ Cypress/ Jersey Village area
"Not yet. But we saw 10+ utility trucks in the KHS parking lot and around 25 or so near the Aldi at vintage park. 

Which neighborhood are you in?"
Apparently! Got up early to make breakfast before the power went out and barely got it done just before lol
Most of us. Seems like they barely got anything done overnight.
I drove around last night and didn’t see anything either. Someone else mentioned there was a tree that took out some lines around Winfern so not sure but fingers crossed it comes back at some point today.
"Thanks.  My neighbor is reporting we're still out and I can't remote into my wifi yet.  Hopefully soon.  Sounds like not all of West U is up.  I just got an email that the community center is online, so maybe more of the western/southern parts are back.

Frustratingly, my entire street is off, and so is all of Buffalo, but across the street was never affected."
Thanks.  We are closer to Shepherd between 10th and 11th.  Currently in the Med Center (new granddaughter born yesterday) and not sure we want to leave right away to go back to a hot house.
I got it last night at 3 AM and power was restored around 9 AM
FM1960 and Woodedge here. We finally got power about 2hrs ago!!!
"That sucks. 
Where exactly are you located? We’re in Southcreek near Queenston."
Do you know by any chance if there is no power near the library or behind the home dpot
"Oh that mean I am screwed cause Im in Westpark and Wilcrest :(
Thank you for the information!"
Yeahh 😫😫
Oh i used to live over there i know where u are! Yeah were literally sitting outside watching these trucks. This is literal hell i wouldnt wish this on anyone.
"Sometimes some buildings in an apartment complex get electric service from one set of lines, and other buildings in the same complex get service from a different set of lines."
[deleted]
"Which corner quadrant do you mean? North or south of westheimer? East or west of Montrose?

I'm a few blocks south and west of that intersection. Happy and hopeful to hear you got power!"
"Ditto. From what I heard, nothing at our complex.

The street lights up 249 past the church were on last night, so im hoping that they can reroute to us soon."
"Nope, supposedly people have received emails and texts from centerpoint that their power is back but the building sent an email that it isn’t"
Great I am in building 3 🥹 thanks so much for the update!
Uuughhh
"If you drive down grant towards tomball there’s some stations down there that have gas 

14011 Spring Cypress Rd
Cypress, TX  77429
United States 

This chick Fila is open and has open gas stations , I filled up in this area

Hope all is well"
I guess orange means I'm outta luck then lol
tysm ! take care 🥰
77006 maybe there is hope!  On the other side of Vaugh marked green but on the border of orange.  Been without power since Monday.
I guess this thread is more reliable than the map. I was updating constantly hoping my spot would turn blue. Congrats on the power back on and thanks!
77007 Cottage Grove East still dark on my street
"Well it’s heading in the right direction then, glad to hear it! Thank you for the update, I appreciate it!"
My house has power! I feel like I could cry from relief
Thank you!!
"Very true. Hearing so many mixed things regarding map. For my own sanity I’m just going with the 17th and if it’s before that, great but expectations are low."
oh!!! good to know!!
have you gotten yours back?
"Yes, it looks like some of that part is a part of our green but deeper into Birnamwood it's a pending review where my brother is."
[deleted]
We just got ours back so hopefully they did as well!
oh my god LOL i hope he is ok!! 
That’s capitalism for you. Profits over people.
Nope completely on the ground. Little York and stone brook. Basically between hollister and bingle. I saw five line man trucks earlier today on the way to work
Thanks and enjoy that cold ac!!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Not sure. We're one of those type of outages and we have not gotten our power back
"Sorry, wrote that on mobile.  Now that I'm back at my desk:

If the generator doesn't have an output breaker, then listen for the compressor in your fridge to shut off.  Once it's off, shut down the generator.   95% of the load in a fridge is the compressor. 

For startup, start with no cords connected and let it come to speed (wait 15sec) then start plugging in your cords.  For the cleanest power from a generator, you want it to be at speed first, not just starting up."
"Mine is still out, all hotels are max capacity and so we finally gave up and got an airbnb. So upset cause all the retail in my area have power!"
No boil water notice
Yeah but I guess the issues are more scattered S of 11th. N of it looks like everything east of Yale is off all the way to 23rd/24th.
"Lmao that is so funny. Glad to hear it’s back, but sorry about your place!"
It depends what side of forum park you are on. One side does have power and the other does not unfortunately I'm on the side the doesn't have power. If you live on the side with the school you should have power.
Any news yet?
"Can't say, I'm in Richmond"
sry the heat is getting to my brain >.<
I'm rooting for you. So close to the JCC - it feels like it should be priority!
It’s such shit. I have to leave my neighborhood just to get service 😭
Yeah cell service over there has always been bad the entire time I’ve lived here. Over 10 years at least.
"Update!! I saw gas being pumped into the underground tank off that she'll, and I assumed restored power. 6 out of state trucks I think Ed staged next door and a centerpoint truck headed there right now! Still alot of damage looks like a job for vegetation, carpenters for the poles and linemen. Still better then not seeing anyone on my daily commute."
That’s sadly where my parents are as well! Thank you!! According to the City Facebook page they are saying tomorrow for majority of Seabrook. 🤞🏽🥴
"That's the hope. My complex has one phase with power back this morning. I'm sitting sweating it out in the dark another night, so don't get your hopes too high..."
"/r/whoosh but seriously they were making a joke because it sounded like you magically brought the electricity with you when you arrived, and those kinds of magical powers could be used all over town."
Did you have power before or no?
Still no power for any of the complexes between Richmond and West Alabama
Thank you for sending this. Damn the numbers are def lower overnight. I was really hoping that they’re working “24/7” as they’ve been claiming. Somebody needs to answer for all this. They’re just constantly lying. They’re falsifying the numbers and showing green areas on the map to increase their numbers.
Thanks for the info. We had the same problem re the automated system until today. We were finally able to reach a live person at CP who was somewhat helpful in providing info regarding our problem (blown transformer fuse) and tonight we finally received an ETA for restoration of 7/19.
My cousins live there and said they got a flicker of power around 7. Hoping that means you might see it tonight.
Congrats!!! I think our power went out for a few minutes a couple of times and I thought they might be working on you guys’ stuff 😅 About time!!
Thanks the the insight! They actually have a record of me calling in 19 times so far. Hopefully power comes soon.
"I saw that pole down on Wednesday when I ran over to Advantage Auto Parts to get fresh oil for my generator.

Yep, that could really be our issue, but I wonder why they can't get to it!

As much of the map that's green now, do they really just not have enough people and trucks??"
"They got that pole fixed today, and our power at our house came on around 3:30 this afternoon.  HUGE relief!!"
Do we need to call about it maybe? Like a bunch of us?
Yeah my husband pays it so id have to ask him. But either way this has NEVER happened at our apts and ive been in 2 hurricanes here..Its horrible. Praying its back on by tmr. Are u close to Braeswood Oaks Apts?
77063
So frustrating 😭😭 I also have a friend who lives across from that HEB and they got their power back a couple of hours ago! Hoping ours comes back soon!!!
Thanks. Took it down. Hard to tell on my phone in the half dark house
I think that was up and running last night around 930.
Damn was hoping that was a bit closer lol.
🤞🏽
Did you get power back?
"Oh excellent, I must’ve missed that when I drove by. Fingers crossed we’re next on their list"
is it by the georgia james/flight club?
Ah not my particular building on W Dallas 😞
Damn. Thanks.
I hear you.  I worry that the small pockets like us will be last.
"Last time we didn't have power for 3 full days, it feels like all the streets around us are getting power but us"
Mines back
Yeah it’s still out. Thought it came back for a sec earlier but unfortunately not
wtf
"Yeah the businesses on West Orem, at the end of my street have power, but the residential streets branching off it don't."
"Oh geez, now they're not even letting people wait in a hold queue!? Well, if you can manage to sign into your account on the Centerpoint website, I've heard they have another way to report an outage online, which may or may not currently be working."
"Blue is the in-between color. It means they've supposedly finished 'assessing' (that's the orange color) and have now 'assigned' the area to a repair team, which may or may not actively be working in the area yet."
Thank you!
I'm close to the Cinco Ranch Blvd./Westhimer Pkwy if that's more accurate.
still nothing :/
"No just generic “we’ve updated the file and added the notes. Will be sent to technician” 

I think because the issue is a transformer it’s gonna be last in line to get looked at with so many others with power in the area"
"I feel your pain man. I’m in the same zip, and haven’t had anything just yet. I’d say you’re probably on the better side of things. Hang tight. You might even get it back on before the night ends."
"I feel you, we’re still without power since Monday morning. Now this rain is gonna prolong that more so. I doubt it gets fixed over the weekend"
Thank you!!
I’m just sick about it. I heard the transformer go pop at 7 am on Monday. All the other neighbors were back on Wednesday… they don’t care about such a small group of houses
They seem to be aware of the pockets but did not know when power would be back on.  Also in the 3-4 times I called I got very different answers so I don’t trust anything they say.
Appreciate it.
"I have been giving them the same welcome I gave them during Ike, waving my hat yelling ""kickass Brother!!!!"". Every single truck I can. My qualms are not with the working folks, and I want them to know they are appreciated."
"Tuesday. They’re doing a lot of work in old town spring, and have been all day, I think that’s what’s holding up my section."
Sunnyridge/longenbuagh/west area
"Folks on the centerpoint system have no other options as they own the infrastructure. 

All the various companies you can get are just resellers for centerpoint."
"so random, but i moved to Houston last week (the same zip code) and it’s been a pain dealing with all this. but you’re updates and stuff have been so helpful. hope we get power mostly so you don’t have to stew in this heat."
"They're only talking about the trees/branches laying on Centerpoint's lines/equipment. Any power company prefers to remove those themselves, to make sure there isn't even more damage done to their stuff, or someone getting electrocuted."
Thank you! Happy for y'all!
Yeah because what’s the difference between today and tomorrow
[deleted]
I’d pay him a visit if you find out his area has power if I were you.
They had crews working 24/7 after the derecho.
Still nothing :(
Thank you!
Looks like this is for Entergy and not CenterPoint.
"That is the same section that I'm interested in, good news.  They probably deenergized it for continued work, and it seems others are saying there are crews in that area.  If you don't mind, definitely update us all here when it comes back!"
Thats great!! Can I ask what streets you are near by? I’m by Richmond and Buffalo speedway
I’ve been stuck at work and really hoping it’s on when I get out of here :/
Nice!! I went to family out in Mission Bend but I'm trying to sleep in my bed. Thanks for the update!
"Bellaire, Fondren, Gessner, area?"
No power and still no eta from centerpoint.
"are you anywhere near Hickory Knoll? I'm off cavendish and praying it's back on when I get home from work.

edit: Just checked with the gf...as right now my house on Cavendish Dr still has no power. We are about halfway between bay area and clear lake city blvd."
Any updates on the power by Lexington?
Nice! Well hopefully it stays on for y'all!
Corner of hwy 6 and Bellfort
Do you know if Sterling Inn has power next to Timmy Chans??
"In my experience, no. We were only out of power for like 5-6 hours back in May thanks to the Derecho, and other major power outages have lasted about that long here."
I’m so fed up with CenterPoint shenanigans. They are like “don’t blame them their trying their best” no the fuck they aren’t because this shit happens every year and every year it’s the same thing with the excuses and “we didn’t know”. The entire Houston area is a logistical nightmare infrastructure wise. I’ve lived east and west and suffered more in 8 years being in the Houston area than my entire 30 years living in various areas across Texas. I get it next to the gulf unpredictable weather but ffs. They keep telling us to “be prepared” why aren’t they prepared? I went 2 weeks without power during the freeze with a 2 day old that shit pissed me off and now I’m stuck in the heat with 90% humidity on top of it.
Thats what my big concern is. Dad is 75 and mom is 71 and both too stubborn to come stay with me or my brother.
Ridiculous. The Fire station on Bintliff got power right away on Monday giving a lot of us false hope. We need serious change in Houston.
It's a hugging emoji
"looks like your on the lucky side, a lot of inwood seems to have power back, im on antoine and long creek and no luck yet"
Unfortunately no luck at all! Still no power 😩😭
"Main in Midtown, I'm not sure, sorry.  it wasn't dark enough when I was driving through to be sure of any thing a couple blocks away."
"Awesome, thank you so much!"
Good advice.
"Thanks! No family this side of the Atlantic but able to hang out with neighbors and friends sometimes. Ty for the pic, made me smile :)"
"Hope so! I’m worried about the storm rolling in in an hour, hope it doesn’t delay things too long. It’s looking promising though, there’s a whole fleet of trucks outside my complex!"
"Wow, that’s fantastic! Will cross my fingers, knock on wood, and literally anything else I can think of lol"
Got the same email. Hopefully earlier but I’m glad they’ve given a date
Power is back on!!!!! Let’s goooooooooo
Sameeee. Ironically the lot near my house (empty lot) is fully green so there’s def some discrepancies with the map (as expected)
What does the green one mean?
[deleted]
You click on the power grid and it may or may not have an estimate.
It's been 100% worthless. They'll text me confirming I've successfully set up the alert service but then I never get any actual alerts sent to me after the fact.   Better off fighting with Centerpoint's automated phone system in my case.
"My relatives have always had no problem getting alerts from Centerpoint, I don't know why the notifications don't go through for some people. They had also been signed up for outage alerts from their power billing company, and I had to help them turn that off because they were getting *more* alerts than they wanted."
[deleted]
That map is not up to date because there are places I know for a fact have power that are in the “assessment” stage.
Thanks! I signed up earlier today but no updates
Yes we are on the same grid then. I thought we were safe because of the proximity to the substation and the fact we have never lost power. I was downright lounging in the ac at 1030 when it went off. Didn’t even bother to eat one last hot meal that’s how sure I was. Ugh
"it’d be one thing if i knew power is coming back tomorrow—one more sweaty night? sure! but idk if it’ll be tonight, tomorrow, or some day next week"
It's coming I can feel it in me bones
"This was posted by someone in a Rice Military Facebook group: 

“Just spoke to a CNP agent. She was very nice. Said only 149 calls have come in regarding outages (in 77007) and 1100 customers are without power. No restoration time though. The 713-207-2222 number is the automated number but if you don’t mind waiting, call 800-245-2377. We need more people to call and report their outages!”"
Just came back.
Thank you!!🙏🏼 I check the map every day. Got some hopes up when it showed up “end of day” yesterday then it got changed back to the standard line. I was crushed.
Hy
"Ah ok, I don't think it's back yet on the other side of NRG where I am unfortunately. Happy for you though!!"
"So close yet so far haha, happy for you though! Gonna hope they keep working on this area tonight."
I'm right next to you :((
"If you value this map, at least we’re in the blue. https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195bcf03ae0c491f9f14bf77f2c43420"
"Yes, Centerpoint's communication has been terrible. Most of the updates they've managed to send to people have been generic ""expect several more days"" messages. Some of the people who got one of those meaningless messages got their power back minutes/hours later."
"We ended up spending the last few days at cooling centers.  The one in Cypress that wasnt bad (Richard & Meg Weekley Community Center).  They had a bunch of rooms where you can charge your things and a bunch of snacks.  There were also some big chairs around which were nice.  It's nothing like home but it took the edge off.  There was also one off Clay Rd that was good, too.  The personnel were very kind."
I hope you have a place to cool off.  Richard & Meg Weekley Community Center in Cypress isnt too far off.  I was there all day yesterday. I also heard Willowbrook was open.  I hope yours comes on today.
Wait no I'm probably thinking of Breckenridge I. Sorry man. Hopefully they'll make their way to both of us soon.
Unfortunately it is still down as of 30 minutes ago
"It's because that number is only the customers restored in the last 24 hours, and many of the last 24 hours were still during the storm when nobody was able to be restored. It's a badly-thought-out way of reporting for a major incident like this, where the total restoration will take much more than 24 hours, and people want to see steady progress."
near Grant and N. Eldridge
"I just drove around, and it seems like only a small portion of Copper Lakes doesn’t have power. Weird."
Sounds like a phase loss/outage may need to try to contact centerpoint our building is doing the same thing.
"There have been other people who had a problem where they could only run low-voltage stuff, no major appliances or ACs, and *that* would be a Centerpoint problem. But your situation sounds like 'something wrong with your house' - you might have to replace that breaker. If you're not up for doing it yourself, you'd need to hire an electrician."
Looks like we are on the same portion then. I just got power a few minutes ago.
How about now? 😭
"I haven't gone home yet, but I signed up on centerpoint to track my specific electricity meter and it says it's off. :(

Did you get power yet?"
"It appears the street lights around Walnut Bend are working, not sure about the actual homes though!"
Walnut bend on the south side of westhimer has power
*muffled screaming*
[removed]
"Thank you so much! I logged onto my electric provider and it says I've used none today so far, so I'm assuming it's still off"
How did they manage?!
Which area? I stay at nottingham and still no power
Right they sure set the goal post back on this one
"It's a generic message going to everybody. Someone in the other thread got the ""several days"" message right before their power came back on. https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyxyve/megathread_day_2_of_recovery_got_a_light/lcfl0d6/"
Thank you for this info!
update: our neighbors have power down the street from us 2 blocks down near Clearwood and Edgebrook.
"Hey man, power just came back for me. Hope they got it working for ya too"
"Ok, thank you, God Bless!"
"I came back to check in on my 77096 friends. Seems like everyone behind us still has no power. Our neighborhood wal mart on N.Braeswood & Hillcroft has it but stores and apts near there all the way to chimney rock has nada. It sucks. Im so sorry guys. We have power but no internet which is fine


ETA, Im near N.Braeswood & Fondren. Were the only complex with power. Stores literally across the street have none."
A friend of mine lives near there by southmore and got power last night
Hoping it comes back soon for you. The map is useless. It’s been over 3 hours and I’m still orange. Friends of mine without power are showing green. It looks like someone just drew on a map of Houston on their iPhone and shaded the areas. Wouldn’t be surprised at this point.
Looks like it. Going on 80 hours without power at my place
"I have a family member that lives in the neighborhood across from you and I believe they are still without power, too. Hopefully today!!"
You can log in to the account and look up your usage stats. Even though it shows my meter being power off I see my hourly usage show up.
I don’t think anyone knows the answer to that… another strong breeze could put you out again
Thank you 😊
"Same here, too :/ hopefully with daybreak, we'll see power come back soon "
"That's okay, I guess I'll just have to go searching like yesterday."
"Ah, a new variation then, but the key phrase about preparing for ""several days"" was the same."
Are you still without power? Hoping they took it down to fix some nested outages on Walnut Bend and it will be back soon.
Oh wow I stay directly across the street from that Walmart and had to leave last night because no power at our apartments. Trying to find out if we have power there yet 🤔
You probably had a transformer blow up
Nowhere around me has power
thank god 😩🤧
Crossing my fingers that we are next.
"fingers crossed things return to normal for you soon.  Definitely out there working.  The guys we saw yesterday were hauling ass to find the transformer that blew with an unmarked pickup truck with two additional personnel with a clipboard following in their wake. As of yesterday evening, the HEB at Keith Harrow had a makeshift charging stations setup at the front of the store for folks. Also The Raddick center is open as a cooling center today (clay road just West of Barker)"
Are you past 610 or the other direction?? I’m like a mile away from target past 610
May be Kess. Either way you guys are in good hands.
I’m just saying man refreshing these threads over and over is torturous and is just going to stress you out and agitate you more. 
damn. hunters green myself. still nothing.
Nothing at Meadowcreek either (Cartwright and La Quinta)
So they weren't prepared
"These were plans contingent on getting their surcharge increased which got denied though right, while retaining $6billion in profits to shareholders. I agree on every day electrician but if Centerpoint can outsource experts from other counties to come in and do repair work now there should be a similar option for the homeowner to make that call and decide to improve the transformer, bury the line, etc if they are willing to pay."
"It is usually very accurate in my experience, and it's much better than Centerpoint's extremely vague bubbles when they have a map working at all."
And what the fuck does that have to do with anything? I’m Not supposed to be fed up because we’re sleeping in sweat?
"Huh, I'm confused why there'd be uncertainty..

Shit just takes a while."
"Simply because of location, the businesses are likely to be directly on a backbone line, while residential areas are on the smaller lines snaking out."
"Oh man!

I’m also 77095
Near sunny ridge and longenbaugh
Nothing yet for us :-/"
Huh.... well least god gave me strong 5g signals just nearly 2 hours ago
I just got back and still no power here. Going to cruise around with my dog for a bit to see if there's anything in the neighborhood :/
"I do, in towne bank. One of the few older ones that isn’t a mc mansion"
Lol nvm then
Darn that socks it bothers me that our house and one other isn't on yet
Of course!
I've been graphing it and replying to every Centerpoint tweet with the updated graph.
Near MKT trail? Driving back from the airport and this is our area.
1900 Yorktown
[deleted]
your power back up yet cause that’s like 10 minutes from me and i’m hoping power bout to come back soon cause i ain’t got the money to keep running my truck
Nope still down
Yea 503 can mean they got too many visitors. My years in web hosting support finally comes in handy 
"Mann no prob , we all jus want some sort of timeline here , the 77070 area been having power for a bit , just the patchy areas been out , they are finally fillin in , u should be up soon"
"If you’re not up by now it should be sum time soon , im not understanding why they are fixing such small areas at a time"
"Thanks, didn’t even know you could swipe the maps. I’m getting a generic message : “ we will continue to provide estimated restoration times as they become available”  I’ll check back later"
Mine just says they completed the assessment and will provide ETA when available 
"I think it's still outdated. It lists my office as without power & no ETA, but it's had power since last night."
Oh ok. Well I did try calling…
I got through; she said no updates but noted it
"I didn’t say a state of emergency had anything to do with funding, but ok thanks for the explanation."
That's great news and you are very welcome for the update! You stay safe as well!
Where in 77354 are you? I’m off FM 2978 next to Woodlands Parkway and still no power.
You get power yet?
above! hoping your power comes back soon though
Power came back on YESSS
I just got power about 15 min ago!! You may have as well
"Yea I just checked my home and still no power. I haven’t gotten an email or anything from CP but my neighbors have. 

They mentioned they got an ETA of Friday as well even though we have a crew assigned now. We’ll see, though. There’s been comments here that people got power before their estimated date so o hope we’re in that group as well"
I wouldn't trust it. There are areas that say there's power but are still out. And my work area has power and was already fixed but the map says they are still pending assessment.
"No prob! We're staying with family right now, but we're gonna head back in the morning. Power better stay on for good now"
Nope no power
Mine doesn’t even have wheels. Shows me for saving money. Thought I was a little over prepared by buying it in the first place.
You must be pretty close to us. We’re in Gleannloch.
Yeah - Im west of Weslayan and most everyone is on over there
Congrats. Maybe you can find a hotel around there. I booked the courtyard for 3 nights as soon as it was clear they had power. Hope I wont need tomorrow night but better to be safe.
"Man I’m just hoping I get it back by the morning, I’m at my parents, but gotta drive 25 min to my house in the morning"
"I'm right by you in Southcreek.  Got the text that it was restored, but no power still."
"I’m near new library on Atwell, no power for me yet"
Are they doing anything? I'm on bobwhite and lymbar. I really hope we get power soon.
still nothing!
Im a few blocks north and east of it and I still don’t have power unfortunately
south and east
"Oh, you live in the same complex? Yeah I stopped by to get a few things about an hour ago… Apartment was a literal oven."
Yeah I saw their email... hopefully they can get it together soon.
Do you know if the power is still out?
"Ugh, sorry to hear that. Will keep this in mind if I see another update from them today. Stay safe!!"
They just let us know all the buildings have power now!
"Take it with a grain of salt, 2 places I know that have power show orange"
"My house still shows orange, but the power came on some time last night. Stayed in a hotel overnight but drove by this morning and we had lights. No idea if it is still on, but it was on when I drove by this morning."
"That's strange, I am 5 min north and got it. Hope you will get it back soon!"
Cry! You are entitled to it after what we’ve been through. You also deserve to soak in your AC now!
we are honestly in the same boat. not expecting to even get it back tomorrow with how flakey they can be. just take it a day at a time
"I have, it came back around 1:30pm. I live on chimney rock and Cheena dr"
"Fantastic.  Wish I'd get a notification my power was on, I could go home and turn off my generator."
"We got ours just before 3:30 today.

Was SO happy to go home and shut off that generator and turn on the main breaker.  Huge relief!"
They did!!!
I’m just trying to power down for the night and wishing my dad was here 😭 I just don’t want to ruin my fridge but I’m also terrified of things like generators. What am I looking for for an output breaker?
UNFORTUNATELY I DONT
"I did go last night but still no power, apparently a power line near Westwood was damaged."
"Yeah I’m in Alief area but I drove into Forum Park at 11AM when I saw the Whataburger was online, and out power was still out. Sad"
Have you heard anything yet? :-(
"Thanks a lot.  Unfortunately, my beloved axolotl couldn't survive the heat and we just lost her tonight.  It may not seem like much, but I think this is pretty much the straw that broke the camel's back as far as my holding it together through all this."
Ooof. Can't think straight without power lol
Nope
"I see, that sucks. Thanks for the update"
The map color scheme has been updated to reflect labels of projected restoration dates. These complexes are sadly “restoration date pending review”. Some places have projected restoration dates as far as next friday…
"Damn, I hope they beat it. I’ll say we got power back today so they can def do better than they say."
"Hey, thanks!  I can see the overhead street light near my house from my upstairs home office window, and as of 8:47 PM Sunday 7/14, we're still dark over here.

Oddly, more houses on my street have generators than don't, it seems.

After the big freeze when I'd walk my dogs, I only heard generators here and there.  

This past week, I hear the drone of a generator at almost every house.

I don't think we're a ""rich"" subdivision, but after the freeze and a couple of 6 to 8 hour loss of power episodes since then, I think many of my neighbors decided to buy 'em.  

I'm sure some of them are just keeping their fridges and some fans & lights running, but some of us got bigger generators that will run our A/C units, and right now I'm really glad I'm in THAT category!  

In years past, I've had to try to sleep on a sweat-soaked bet without any A/C or even a fan, and I do NOT intend to do that again if I can possibly avoid it!"
We got power back around 3:30 this afternoon.  HUGE relief.
"They got Greenwood Forest back online for God's sake, I tried to drive through there Tuesday and Wednesday and HUGE trees where down everywhere, some pulled lines down with them. But they have power now. This pole has no vegetation around it, it looks like they need to put up new pole, connect the lines, and boom, done. I don't know how it all works but if they can fix Greenwood that quick, this should be a walk in the park. Then there are main transmission lines down the road, just divert the power or something. I don't know. Pisses me off. "
"Yes I came home to power and a cool home. Such a relief. 8 day, 10 hours. I don't know how I did it."
"I've tried everything I could to talk to someone at CP. Phone call, FB messenger, email, they don't want to listen. I would even call in and be chill, I know it's not the phone persons fault. I just want real, technical answers. "
THIS IS SUCH A FELT HAHA when they told me that i was like 🧍🏻‍♀️🥲
Oh ok! I drove by it around 9 and it was dark
"Sorry, hoping they move on to y’all next but at least someone is in the ZIP working."
[deleted]
I just saw that we got updated to “blue” on their shitty map so let’s see if it’s worth the pixels they edited.
Which cross streets are you at?
"Yeah, it's a difficult situation. If you don't live in the vicinity of ""near Oakridge School Road, Jetoma Rd & surrounding areas"" that tonight's update said they were working on in the Woodlands, hopefully they'll list some different streets in tomorrow's midday update."
https://gis.centerpointenergy.com/OutageReporting/start.html
I have filled in the link over and over hoping they get the message
"There is no color at all blue, green or orange."
thanks for the update. i’m on cinco ranch and gaston but it’s still out 😓
"i’m angry for you, and for everyone stuck in this shithole state with no intervention or clarity. katy public library and maud marks library are open—volunteering there today w water, electricity, outlets, and AC. La centerra is also open, but it’s probably packed. come by if you need."
"I think that’s our problem too, just wish we had some kind of information"
Same. I feel like my life is on pause and they don’t care
Gah! That’s so frustrating. I appreciate your responses. Stay cool!
I saw a power pole and transformer down in a neighborhood next to mine right at the entrance.
Thanks for info! That’s a ways from me but it’s good to know they are in the area.
"and now i’m crying, i hope you’ll be ok soon too!! i do my best to keep myself up to date and in contact with resources whenever they’re available.

like the food trucks! there’s a few that have started posting up at the W Tidwell and Hollister intersection, but i usually only see them later in the day. this is of course outside of the Target and Walmart nearby that are also open during the day (however immensely crowded).

godspeed, we’re gonna need it o7"
"That makes sense but surely there’s low hanging fruit other crews could mobilize to help with - debris blocking access to equipment, roads, etc. every second counts type of approach"
? Can’t tell if you’re being an ass or not
77386 restored.
[deleted]
Yes that’s what my comment said 
That’s good to hear. I’ll update when it comes back!
My modem is showing back online now. You asked for an update but I’m nowhere near home to confirm if I have power back or not.
It’s back on!
I’m closer to S Shepard and Richmond! Hope you have it when you get back!
Beechnut and gessner area
"Thanks, I bet you'll be back online soon"
The restaurants around there have power so it should as well.
"> The entire Houston area is a logistical nightmare infrastructure wise. 

Yep."
"Damn, I hope you get yours back really soon!"
I saw four bucket trucks on my way down woodway from 610 to Voss.  It’s happening!
Wohoooooo!!!!
"Yes and after looking closer, the map shows the whole neighborhood on the other side of a bayou near my house being green. I can clearly see from my front yard there's still no power there."
"Supposedly that the area is fully repaired, but from multiple complaints in the comments here tonight, it apparently ignores smaller remaining outages and marks the whole area green when the bigger cause for that area has been repaired. 

Anyone in a 'green' area on Centerpoint's new map who doesn't actually have the power back on yet should probably try to call Centerpoint at this point, since it's unclear if it's just their public map that's so incomplete, or if their internal data is no longer aware of that person's outage too."
"You’re right, my bad"
[deleted]
Don’t know it it helps you or not /u/Main-Ad3654 but just got another update from them saying they’re still working on fixing the problem near my address.
"Yeah was surprised when I got one, still not sure if I should believe it or not. I’m guessing since they sent one they might actually be working."
Did you get your power restored yet or find a place to stay for the time being?
for my complex they said the 13th but i dont trust it
What cross streets ?
No problem. The CP rep I spoke to told me earlier not to depend too much on the map. It’s not the most accurate. She said to call in and ask for an update regarding the issue. I get a lot more information if I’m patient and kind and ask if they’re holding up okay. Just FYI. Kindness goes along way!
"Not back for me yet either, also 77054. :("
"Appreciate that, I’m in the orange 😂.  All good though, I’ll tough it out with my cats, I do have a fan running off a small inverter.  So I have that going for me."
I got a message a few hours after my power had went out the first time around that I don’t have power. Jee thanks Centerpoint! Wouldn’t have known!
Why do I feel like that’s the hold up in our area? And I saw we got a new restoration date of Wednesday the 17th 😓
You get power back finally? 
"ok i will contact centerpoint tomorrow though they might be too busy. i just returned to my house. still no lights are coming on in the bedrooms on that side. actually no lights at all anywhere turning on on that side of the house though like i said previously, only the bathroom outlet on that side of house is working. i haven't tried tripping the main breaker for the whole box though. i will try that tomorrow morning before calling. i don't want to do it now as the house is cooling still."
not sure what happened to the breaker though. it was fine before the storm. the whole panel wasn't jolted during the storm to cause the breaker to break for those bedrooms. every other breaker is fine.
I got power now! Around 2 PM Tuesday
Nope it's depressing!
"I finally got on the centerpoint text updates - it doesn't sound like people have gotten super useful information from the text alerts, but when you make the account, it will show if your specific meter is on or off. Mine is off haha.

But your meter number should be on your electric bill! Sounds like you have a workaround though."
"I got power! Not sure about the rest of the area, but it showed up on my centerpoint account (again, registered this week with my meter number). Best of luck!"
"FROM: CenterPoint Energy

CenterPoint Energy has completed the impact evaluation step in our restoration process and mobilized nearly 12,000 local and mutual assistance crews. Crews are currently focused on restoring essential facilities critical to health and public safety like hospitals, police and fire facilities. Due to the severity of the storm, please be prepared to be without power for several days. Thank you for your patience and understanding during this challenging time. We will send updates as they become available.

Thank you! Makes me feel a little more hopeful
"That's good to hear! Unfortunately not for us, even though the streets across from us have power. Staying at my cousin's place up the road who have power at least."
I was just at that Walmart!
"We got it last night for 4hrs, 8 pm to midnight."
"It shows green on the map. Hopefully, it'll be back soon!"
In the monte lago? Hopefully they get power today and us too! Been hearing some things like Sunday everyone will be back up by end of day but also this might be a week long thing? I’m praying for the best but it’s becoming really hard to stay positive!
I meant power going out in like the next 2 days because they’re still working on restoring power around me. I know wind can make this happen again in a week lol
I don’t have power yet unfortunately
"Yes, meaning they don't have a clue and all their estimates are crystal ball voodoo."
"Yea I wonder how bad our luck is that we didn’t get our power back on, and of course bellagio nor center point gives any update on when we get ours back."
I got through to center point and they still say by the end of the day although no one is currently assigned to the ticket so I have my doubts
Thanks for that info. Got a kid and some elderly parents gonna get them up that way while I tough it out at home with the pets. Gonna probably put them in my car to cool them off if it gets too bad inside.
Yes I’m pass 610
You’ll probably get it sometime tonight
"I'm not really sure if the plans are dead in the water tbh, I can't find any news articles since anything Google turns up is Beryl related now.  If it did get halted due to a rate hike being denied that is definitely another mark against them, as they certainly have the money as you mentioned and have what look to be solid solutions.  

On contractors, agreed, if out of state workers are rebuilding infrastructure as we speak, there should be room for third parties to do the same if homeowners want to pay.  As long as they have some kind of blessing from CP or assurance from some kind of entity they will meet standards"
If you're so hardened then why are you so fed up?
"why are you acting like it's your first ever storm? power goes out during hurricanes!

nobody disparaged you for venting about how much this sucks, kindly extend the same courtesy to others.

not everyone has lived here for 20yrs. for a ton of people, this IS their first hurricane."
well that right there will tell you residents aren't priority.
Yes
Thanks
"Yes, been back since 5:00pm-ish"
That's what I'm getting too
Fml this says I’m due 7/14 EOD
"Okay, I misread that bit. But ""state of emergency"" still wouldn't help with this situation. It was used for the extreme flooding after Harvey to try to keep people out of the deeply flooded areas, but usually isn't used for hurricane recovery situations. 

FEMA is already deploying a bunch of resources according to https://www.ltgov.texas.gov/2024/07/08/acting-governor-dan-patrick-provides-update-on-hurricane-beryl-response-efforts/

""FEMA Region 6: More than 100 personnel, 500,000 Meals Ready to Eat, 800,000 liters of Water, 20,000 Tarps, 2,500 Rolls of Plastic Sheathing, Generators, Urban Search and Rescue Teams, Tractor-Trailers, Communications and Command Vehicles."""
Northgrove neighborhood off of 2978
Nope.
whats your cross street?
Omg finally! Happy for you. I hope so too.
Good lord CP is a hot mess
"As soon as you can, get to a hardware store (I know Harbor Freight carries these; probably Lowes, Home Depot, and Northern Tool have something similar) and buy a flat [furniture-moving dolly](https://www.harborfreight.com/18-in-x-12-in-1000-lb-capacity-hardwood-dolly-58312.html?event_id=182734). I don't know if it would be safe to run the generator on it, but at least you'd only have to lift it a few inches on and off of the dolly when it's time to move it, and then you could easily roll it where it needs to go."
"Mine doesn’t either, lol!!!! It’s a Genkins inverter generator. Not overly heavy, but it ain’t light by any stretch of the imagination. Now the Champion we got is unbelievably heavy. It’s not even out of the box yet. We’re gonna start using that one tonight and give the other one a rest. We’ll oil it up and just give it a break. Then we’ll bust out the beast lol"
"I am literally right by Klein High, so we are close. I keep hearing more and more places around us getting power. I will update if/when we get it back. I am so hopeful for today. I can't do another night sleeping in the heat and my car was NOT comfortable to try to sleep in last night. 

Luckily my office in 77389 (near Klein Collins) has power, so we are posted up here for now charging and soaking up a little ac."
Are there rooms at the Courtyard?
"Same for me, hope we get it soon sometime. I think there is a single branch on that line but they haven't stopped by"
2 trucks left the other 2 theres nobody in them. :(
[deleted]
Not looking forward to sleeping there tonight....
It is. Seems like literally just our our block from the cvs to the sterling is without. Everyone else has it
I don't think they have updated the page since 3pm on the 9th (based on the statistics block at the bottom)
I'm in the orange and never lost power.
How’s it going? We’re in the same area. Any more lights flickering?
oh your on the opposite bayou from us!
"Also, thank you for all the help."
"Thank you. I did the same, just to grab some things but just standing inside made me start sweating. If I hear anything, I would be sure to let you know. I’m just patiently waiting :-("
Nothing
The fact that you didn’t correct me for not knowing this is a type of fish. How kind of you. And I’m sorry I didn’t realize sooner
"I’m so sorry to here that!! Fur babies hold us together more than they know. At this point, I’m just shocked how we’re all still keeping it together on what is about to be Day 5."
"Weird, I really hope they get this together soon..."
"Congrats on the power.  And thanks, that gives me some hope!"
Did you get power? On another thread someone else near our area received power 40 ish mins ago!
"Yeah, I was thinking about the building near green oak and the 101 fire station"
Not yet
Just got power back.
Well that is something!
Heights and W 13th
thank you for the info!! just got power back
Yea same here friend. Here’s to hoping it gets resolved for both of us sooner rather than later
"City/county crews and random residents have already been clearing trees from roadways since as soon as the storm passed on Monday. Pretty much the only trees are still in the roads at this point are the *really* big trees that need special equipment, from what I've seen/heard."
"“if not today i’m sure by tomorrow”

Definitely I am being an ass, because who are you to forecast when the power comes back? What if if doesn’t return by tomorrow? You letting us in?"
That’s not too far from me! I’m near the Woodway/Voss area. Hopefully they venture just a liiiiittle bit north east when they’re done!
"Yes, my bad. I’m pretty sleep deprived and missed that part."
Y’all know the number for center point?
This gives me so much hope! We’re also 77077 at Kirkwood and Southlake so hopefully these trucks fix whatever is wrong across Briar Forest!
"Thanks! I'll update in return when we know, but it's for apartments off of Whittington so might be separate."
"Thanks, can confirm as well, friends got home to power!  Looks like that area is all getting restored this evening."
Aw man I’m at bellaire n gessner. Hoping it comes back soon 🤞🏽
I hope so!! They left the area outside my complex so I hope they just moved on to fix another part and they didn’t give up!
Thanks! This map is def not accurate. Shows green where my family lives and they don’t have power in Sugar Land. They are old and don’t have online accounts so I wish I could report on their behalf but I think I need electric meter number. 
Four hours later update?
What is the number that you called? Thank you for answering my questions. I just really want my home back
[Cat tax](https://imgur.com/a/pDPEctw)
"On the bright side, they posted that this map is out of date 🤡 I don’t even believe their numbers tbh. I saw tons of crews down in Angleton and Lake Jackson not a single one in Houston driving down there, I would assume Houston is tomorrow/into Friday."
"Well we've been in limbo for two days 77011 some power, no water or AC the larger appliances don't work and our kitchen has no power."
Got power back like 45 minutes ago!! Good luck!
Thank you! Mine is back too!!!
Not sure what to make of it. Most of my friends who do not live in a hospital or a fire station managed to get power back.
Has it been off since then?
"No, the neighborhood across Hughes. I've been seeing reports of utility trucks working in our area, Blackhawk near scarsdale and apparently inside Lakes of Goldcrest. Hopefully we all get power back today!"
Not even centerpoint will tell you that
[deleted]
Was reading a thread on nextdoor and apparently the Bellagio is on like three different transformers and we just happen to be on the same one as the neighborhood behind us so no power. Lucky us.  I checked the center point map and it says that our expected restore time is end of day Friday.  
"How in the world did you get through to them I always get the automated voice. By end of day is comical, it’s midnight and still no power. Hopefully tomorrow we have better luck. Called the main office today  and they have no clue. How hard is it to just get the rest of the buildings working."
"Also, how do you check if anyone is assigned to the ticket?"
take care and stay hydrated (you and the critters).
Fingers crossed 🤞
"YES!!! Thank you for this sound advice! We actually already have the Champion on a dolly right now. It comes with oil already in it and all we will need to do is take it out of the box and gas it up. It actually has more power capacity than our Genkins. It’s a heavy beast, but we are going to have to give the Genkins a break. That little guy has been crushing it now for 4 days!"
"Not for tonight, yes for tomorrow (I pray we wont need them)"
Yes! I just noticed my security cameras came back online!
What a joke 
Yep. Centerpoint is only updating that map once or twice a day currently.
no 😭 nothing. UGH
Oh I see. I hope you get power soon!
"What is the generator make and model?  I am using general ""best practices"" for portable generators, but if I know make and model, I xan give you relevant info for what you have."
"Forum park now has power, just came to check. It was like the gates of heaven 🥹"
Same but if I do I’ll let you Forum Park fam know. :(
I didn't even notice.  Not something I'd take issue with anyway.  Thanks for being kind.
"Yeah, we have some cats and a dog as well.  The cats are fine, couldn't care less.  Dog is a ball of anxiety on the best day.  I'm taking a break from sleeping out on the patio and trying to sleep in the car tonight.  I work outside, so sleeping outside on top of it, while it's actually kind of fun, just isn't in the cards tonight.  The Centerpoint map is now saying this area is expected to be up by the 14th, but if it takes that long y'all might see me on the news."
As of now I heard nothing. I think they just skipping around us atp! It’s really infuriating when it’s just so close yet somehow missing us!
[deleted]
Hey neighbor. Any progress on your end?
so happy to hear that for you :D what a relief!!
If you have a source on the city / county crews I’d be interested
"Me too lol. It’s all right, good luck out there today."
I’m in apartments off Whittington too lol so definitely the same area!
"They have to deenergize lines to fix others, so I’m sure they are just keeping the circuit “off” to make their repairs.  It’s a numbers game for them, so I’m sure they wouldn’t waste time addressing an area without being able to translate it into reducing their “people affected” counter.  Feel super optimistic!  

Keep me posted if you come online please!  I’m still at a friend’s house so I’d love any note from you if lights come on, if you’re willing."
"There should be an account number printed on their paper bill too - Centerpoint would probably want that instead of the meter number. Go ahead and ask your relatives for both numbers just in case, and then you can probably call on their behalf."
Nothing really. No power still and no further updates.
713 207 2222 go to the emergency line. Don’t be put off if the other person sounds exhausted and over it! They’ve been getting yelled at all week. 😞
"i tried calling and they're too busy. i'm still not getting power to my bedrooms and outlets(AFCI). i was going to call Discount Power who i have service with, but they go through Centerpoint anyway."
So happy for you!
Yeah
Let’s hope today’s the day!!! Praying it is we have little kids in our house and I just feel so bad for them thank you so much for all the information keep me updated !
"Thanks Disco, that at least alleviates some stress, not sure how much longer I can take of this."
"I just saw Allen house has power back which is right next to us, are you around the sterling?"
[deleted]
Power yet? We still don’t have it ….
Is it still on?
"I'm going to go check first thing in the morning, but I got an email from Centerpoint saying it's back on, and my Wi-Fi gateway is showing ""connected"" for the first time this week"
We’re near the end of El Lago area and we still have no word on this. How are you holding up? We’re waiting for the FEMA stuff to open up to get aid.
My parents just roughing it through and sleeping inside and I left to my sisters place who has power. They said they couldn’t part with the property not knowing what would happen if we weren’t there to look out for it. Our first hurricane experience so we aren’t sure what to expect at this point. Props to all the Houston natives for going through this mess on a yearly basis. We already have talked about moving back.
I’m not sure. We left for Austin but I can see my WiFi hub is still down so I’m fairly certain power is still down. WiFi was working when plugged into our battery pack.
"Do you still see non-massive trees blocking the road when you try to drive around in hurricane-hit areas? If not, who do you think removed them? Friends/family near the eye of the storm have told me they've seen both local gov workers and random people helping clear roads, and that they could drive unobstructed everywhere they tried to go today except for one street that had a huge tree still down. It's not the kind of thing that gets a bunch of news articles about it. If you're really that interested, call your local city hall in the morning, and ask them if they've had city workers clearing roads."
Came back from church coffee shop to find lights on! Hope you got your power back too!
For sure! Here’s hoping!
Thanks so much! Helpful! 
Just got power!
Could be something on their end or perhaps your weatherhead was damaged somehow. I hope it gets resolved soon 🙏
I live at the sterling! Hopefully our place is next!!
And it will stay that way until Centerpoint gets around to manually updating their map some time later today.
no 🥲 we don’t. the map says we get it today.
What you finding fable
"Lots of trees have been cleaned up and they're reconnecting lines over off of Cedar right now.  I noticed a lot of the back portion that has had power all week was off as of about a half hour ago, so I'm hopeful that's because they're finally about ready to throw the switch.  There were a lot more issues in peoples' yards that I think were taking longer to get to.  They were just reconnecting up at the Pebblebrook/Cedar intersection and crews were pulling out of the Loch Lake portion.

My wife and I just checked into a hotel nearby because I just can't do another night in the car or on the patio.  Of course, this means power will probably be restored shortly since I spent the money."
We did too!! Was thinking of you as well.  I hope you get plenty of cold air and tv today :).  Was nice having someone in 77057 to chat with.
"weatherhead? i can't get through using that number, so they don't even know about my issue much less the time it will take for them to get to it.  it's disappointing to have. power , but still shower in the dark. thx."
Are you there right now and still no power?
Takes a long time for that intern to mark up the map in MS Paint!
I called them and they said we should get it by midnight
"My lights were indeed on, but they shut off again around 2 AM"
"Yes, my dad just sent me a video of the street!! I’m hopeful it’ll be tonight!!! Glad y’all were able to do so. We didn’t bother calling around, we figured day 5 was too late to start haha. Thank you so much for all the updates truly you have no idea how much you have help guide us through our first. Y’all be safe!!"
"No, I’m not there now :/"
do you live/near ariel street?? omg now im excited
ya my neighbor called like 5 times last night saying lights were back on and my wife woke up to her sending a text saying everything was off again. i’m bummed
"You too.  We got lucky and the Captain Inn opened up.  It's not the Four Seasons, or even Four Seasons Total Landscaping, but it's better than my patio for $73 a night and being pet friendly."
"I’m sending a scouting party, I’ll let you know if it’s back"
Yep!
Yes please! Thank you so much!!
AHHHHHHHH OMG PRAYING
"Just called the building, still no power"
WE JUST GOT IT BACK BABY YEAAAAAAAHHH
Thank you for checking! Their lack of communication is awful 
Do you think having elevators 1 or 2 running means we're getting power soon?
We got power back! Elvators are down
We’re at the end of the culdasac and we don’t have ours 😭😭
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! next to the karate place?? your the street with the dead end?
Yeah all of the dead end streets don’t have it at the very end next to Herod
"I may be Houston strong. But, I’m Houston angry also."
"No, the storm didn't break us. It's never \*just\* the storms.  

The infrastructure failed us. Our leaders failed us. Corporations putting profits over people failed us. This state's government continues to fail us and harm us. 

I will never judge anyone for leaving when it has become increasingly detrimental to every aspect of our quality of life to continue to stay here. If you can leave, godspeed, I hope you find a place that actually wants you to thrive there."
"It did something to me. 8 days without power is a serious low. I even live in a pricey neighborhood in Rice Village. Politics are so divisive, people can't even agree that the TX power grid needs regulation to prevent a Cat 1 storm from knocking the 4th largest city in the US out for over 1 week.

There was a time in day 3 where I watched a tree leaning on a power line catch on fire. CNP never came out and HFD couldnt do anything unless the fire spread to my house. CNP is so bad. Just god awful."
I'm Houston Getting Da Fuq Outta Here.
Storms in Houston are more frequent and more severe. It’s only going to get worse.
"I started planning my exit a year ago, seeking a new adventure and a change of scenery. Being without power for 4-days post Derecho and 6 post-Beryl have solidified my desire to try something new. I’m leaving at the end of the month.  

I grew up in Alief in the 80s-90s, an upbringing that taught me so much about cultural and economic diversity. I have lived all over town. There are so many things and people that make Houston special. Not sure if I’ll ever move back but I hope my friends and family who live here see improvements to infrastructure and public education among other things. Nothing but love to H-Town and all y’all who continue to hold it down."
"I'm just as tired as everyone else. I wish I could start over and leave TX but the few family members I have left are here, and that's important to me too. Texas can and should do better."
"Yep I’m considering moving out 

Maybe College Station or San Antonio"
"If anything, it exposed how terrible Houstons infrastructure really is. 

It took a storm for people to realize if things go south there’s no telling wtf is going to happen"
"For those considering moving to a different city, I made a spreadsheet the last time a thread like this came up this week.  It has a breakdown of the top 50 US Metro areas by population (Wikipedia). CoL is a generic number.  Public link:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yr4sIjde-ZflSpU-_obfGJo2sazsj6AHcADskTH-tOU/edit?usp=drivesdk"
"I considered it after the Freeze. After last year's heat streak, I made up my mind.

I'll be moving out in September."
"I was telling a coworker this morning that this whole thing feels so different. Trees still fallen over, branches and limbs down all over the place—even in the middle of major streets—with city workers not even bothering to clean em up, streetlights still out in many places, got neighbors who take great care of their yards who have just left all the debris in their yard for more than a week now…

It’s like the city is experiencing a collective moment where we are all saying, ‘Fuck it. I just don’t care anymore. I’m too fucking tired to give a shit.’"
"We’ve thought about it for a while. North Texas is generally built for tornados as compared to a swamp bowl that refuses to bury power lines, cannot prepare for emergency management - ever - and is generally full of road raging, incompetent maniacs."
"It was a Cat 1 when it hit Texas. 

THIS WAS FROM A FUCKING CAT 1. 

We’re beyond fucked with this city’s incompetence."
Moved away from Houston after the summer of 2011. No regrets. Life is better in the Chicago burbs.
Everyone will forget come election time sadly and nothing will change 😔
"Meanwhile, my husband and I are trying to make our way back to Houston from CA but seeing everything that’s been going on, definitely makes me second guess our choice a bit."
"Grew up in Houston, moved away for 10 plus years as an adult and finally excitedly moved back last summer. Excitement wore off quickly. Moving again out of state and was feeling a little guilty/bad about leaving my “hometown” again, but not anymore. Can’t wait to get the F out of Houston and Texas."
They keep blaming this on the storm and not the slow response and terrible communication from CP and the city. 
"Born and raised here in Houston and it’s hard for me to admit that I would like to live somewhere else but I can definitely confirm I have lost the interest in living here. So much stuff has been said in the past few weeks that there’s no way to deny the fact that we are getting completely fucked over and over again by the “leaders” of the state, and I wouldn’t even say leaders but more just fucked up creatures that look like humans in positions of power. I’m interested in moving to Seattle and being close enough to travel to Vancouver when I want. As soon as I am able to make those moves, I’m outta here"
"I'm tired of Houston. So tired.

I have numerous physical disabilities, including quite severe asthma, arthritis, and more. Houston's air quality is terrible, the power grid is worse, and having to endure prolonged outages in Summer Heat feels like torture.

I was born here, but I'm so done with this city... my wife and I both are. The only thing stopping us from leaving is money."
I’m here another 8-10 years until my kids are out of school and then I’m finding an alternative
"If i had the opportunity and money, I'd definitely look to leave this state. Anytime it rains now, im sitting there wondering if power will fail."
Adding a home generator that's FO SHO.
I was more than ready and looking into leaving pre-Beryl. Watching my stubborn ass parents swelter in 98 degree weather without power for almost 2 weeks straight without staying with me despite being one of the lucky few to be in a wealthy and central enough area to retain power through Beryl sealed the deal for me. Just ridiculous governance in every way. Shameful. I'm born and raised for 23 years in Houston but I am not putting my roots down in this city. State gov already had me gone but this shit specific to this city is not doable.
"I’m held up a little while here in Denver at the airport. Chatting it up with a lot of travelers today, all commiserating on the clusterfuck. When I tell them I’m from Houston, all they can talk about is Beryl, and the fact that some are still without power. Not a good look for Abbott’s “Texas Miracle.”"
"Yep, planning now to gtfo by end of the year."
My family is still angry about the storm. They’ll be living in NC with me in 2 weeks. The kids are traumatized from it.
"Honestly, not that bad of a storm but the lack of city Maintance with already dad trees and rotten power poles is what did it"
"I wish I could just pack up and move. Out of Texas preferably, but it's not that easy for many/most people unfortunately, including myself. Gotta have the initial funds, a job lined up, a job lined up that pays you a living wage for your new destination, etc. So much to take into account that many people can't just pack up and leave despite wishing they could"
Storms a nightmare. I would leave if my career wasn't here
"Lost the front of my house. Lost memories I can never replace. My husband is gone 6 months and my dog went 2 months before him and my Mom died a few months before that,the first night in this home! 
 I'm broken. I'm exhausted and no hope really. Beryl took the last of me if feels like. I survived Katrina in Nola though! 28 days no power. Brutal,but not this humid! Dew point meets humidity damn near daily. My body,my mind,  my hands and feet are all fully rebelling. At least a month more. It has caused my whole self to be unsafe...and my dog? Who is that barking mad man? I'm looking for a map to hope.Anyone seen it? I think finances pick where I stay. I rent btw."
"Not the storm, Centerpoint, and the republican response of ""Fuck Houston, they vote democrat""."
Just an observation but I have not seen a single peep about Beryl outside of Texas subs. Wonder if it’s just the election stuff or the assassination stuff or bidens current Covid-fueled Twitter rampage or any of the million other reasons I could think of but don’t want to.
"Has anyone noticed that they have stopped cutting the tree branches away from the power lines?  Who is responsible for that. By the way, Beryl broke me as well.  I spent over $2000 dollars since the derecho on a generator, outdoor extension cables, fans, gas cans, 10 gallons of gas per day and finally a portable air conditioner."
"It’s a bluff. 

People claim “they are leaving” for a myriad reasons. But never do. 

I can remember a number a people that claimed they were leaving after someone got elected. They never left. 😂"
Seriously. I’ve seen no less than 2 accidents a day in the east end. Everyone is agitated and confrontational. People are making matters worse with their piss poor attitudes. I understand and feel the anger too but we can’t let it out on each other.
Everyone should leave Texas. Take your tax dollars somewhere else.
"Ill be gone by next week. As a native Texan, it's not worth it anymore to stay."
"I’m from here, However, haven’t lived here for over a decade and have some time is regretted living elsewhere for a variety of reasons including family. This disaster has made me have little to no regrets about not living in Houston anymore. I mean, I’ve been through hurricane Ike and I didn’t hear this much outrage about no power like I’m hearing with this storm."
I only went 24hrs with no power. I'm on dialysis I had to drive an hour for delayed emergency treatment that was a fraction of my normal one. I was sick for a week. I could have died. These clinics charge about 30k a month up to double that. To Medicare and ins. Each clinic easily has 20+40 patients a day. Fresenius and DaVita are multi billion dollars companies. Per year. THERE IS NO REASON THEU CANNOT AFFORD A GENERATOR ON EACH CLINIC. oddly I'm California and Arizona all of not half have generators on them. Yeah they never need them. However in here I'm TEX-ASS in the heart of hurricane tornado country not a single clinic has them. Wonder why ?? Because the state doesn't make them. I can guarantee you patients on dialysis have died after this storm. No one will count them as a hurricane death. Just another kidney failure patient. On can live on dialysis for 15+ years easily. If you take xare if yourself and start young. 20+ is not unheard of.
"I wonder if Centerpoint cares that they are the singular reason why thousands of people want to leave Houston, a great city that deserves a decent power grid."
"A couple more storms like this one (this year) and Houston will probably be a ghost town, but weather is getting crazy everywhere you can go ."
"crawl vegetable joke act wise voiceless bedroom scale long hospital

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*"
Born and raised Houstonian. I have been living out of state since being in the military. I had the choice this year to move back. I decided against it and Beryl and the freeze are huge reasons why. I don’t want to live in uncertainty with the power grid.
"People are mad but no one here is smart enough to change who they are voting for. In the end reality makes no difference it’s a brand. Texas is Republican and the more solidified that happens the more they can fuck with us. I don’t care about sides I’m sure any party would be corrupt if they were guaranteed to win every election. 

Anybody complaining here vote Republican in the past but is now going to change? Show of hands."
We leave next May. Already setting up camp elsewhere. A blue state for sure.
"New York interviewed renters with damaged rent homes, sure easy for them to move. Lucky to have no major damage. Though each disaster has had couple thousand in repaires. Home insurance is way higher, 5,500 State Farm, another 900 for fema. Never made a claim."
"Born and raised here and I hope the majority of y’all leave.  I love y’all, but it’s just too many of y’all.  And y’all all seemed to arrive at the same time.  That many people puts a strain on everything.  If y’all all leave at the same time and tell your friends how bad it is here, maybe we’ll be able to drive all of our freeways like we used to."
I hope people leave! It’s overly crowded everywhere
Just buy a generator.  You'll be ok. Can't afford one? Use a buy now pay later company like Affirm to purchase one with low monthly payments.
Fuck Houston
"I’ll never forget back in 2017 when my Wife told me she wanted to move back to Houston. We had been living in Atlanta for 2 years and just had our first child. She wanted to be closer to Family and at the time that made all the sense in the world. 

I remember we finally came to the decision to move back in June of 2017. Neither one of us was really excited to move back but knew it would be the best decision to make with having our first child to be closer to family. 

Now I wasn’t excited to move back due to me enjoying living in the Atlanta metro. Don’t get me wrong Houston and Atlanta has some similarities. Houston’s food was much better( but I also was in better shape and we saved more money cause we didn’t eat out as much) and I did miss the diversity of Houston. I’m also Texan originally from East Texas so being away from my Family in ETX and in Houston was a bit of a bummer. But outside of those things I didn’t miss living in Houston as much as I thought I would. Matter fact the 2 times we visited when we were living in Atlanta made me regret not moving out of Houston earlier. 

I can count on one hand how many times I had to deal with flooding while living in Atlanta. When it would rain heavily they never really lasted long and you didn’t have to worry about constant flooding driving home from work. 

Also there were actual 4 seasons and summers were tolerable. For 2 years I knew how it felt to live in a big city without having a nervous breakdown due to violent weather and piss poor infrastructure. 

So by the time we told our apartments we were no longer renewing our lease and I had already put in a transfer back to Houston did I get a reminder on why I was less stressed living in Atlanta than in Houston. That reminder was Harvey. We were living in Atlanta during Hurricane Harvey but watching the madness unfold on tv. Immediately I knew we were gonna regret moving back. 

Fast forward to today and now my Wife is coming around to the idea of moving back to Atlanta. She actually wanted to move out of Houston years ago but wanted to remain in Texas. She likes DFW but I can’t do Texas anymore period."
"I felt like this after the freeze for 43 seconds, which is the amount of time it took me to discover the amount of square footage I could afford anywhere else I’d be willing to live. (spoiler: divide your sq footage by 2, and multiple the rent/mortgage by 3)

I just consider it the Houston tax. Don’t forget to factor in a few thousand in repairs and 1-2 weeks of utter despondency every couple years. Still better than owning a dilapidated shack in buttfuck, California (after the emotional pain dissipates)"
"Considered it, but Houston is my home and unless I’m forced out I’m here to stay and at least to make things better"
"I never lost power for more than a minute due to Beryl, but I’ve lived here for going on 8 years and cannot believe how fucked things are.

As a Midwest transplant, losing power for a couple days during the cold snap a few years back just blew my mind. I sat in my cold apartment thinking “Seriously? This is all the winter it takes for everything to fall to shit here?”"
Please leave too many people live here
Yeah people should totally do it.
Houston is an absolute Hell Hole and I can’t wait to leave.
I grew up in Houston and gave up on it over 20 years ago. I’ve never understood why other people stayed.
"I would like to leave.. I’ve been here for 45 years and been through bad storms and hurricanes.. What compounds how bad things get is the blatant greed and full tilt profiteering.. Compounding that is the ‘fuck your feelings’ compassion 
expressed from city and state government and freely distributed in the suburbs amongst the recently minted melanin-deprived upper-middle class..

I get it, I’m old and irrelevant.. 

This city/county is completely unprepared for a Cat 3 or 4 storm..
We are ripe for a Katrina event and the bumblefucks who run this place will be profoundly inept to deal with it..

Beryl has acutely demonstrated that fact, in action..

I’m very, very tired and dismayed at the general ‘fuck you’ attitude that stinks up this entire area.. 

And I’m looking right the fuck at you Cinco Ranch.."
Get a generator
I see your Beryl and raise you an Ike. Went for almost a month without power.  It's just something you live and cope with.  Gotta love them live oaks.
"When I moved here two years ago it was the first place I ever lived that the people in the place wanted to hear no wrong about their city, and talked down on every other city. What a funny vacuum bubble this place is.  I’m ironically in California for the month (where I’ve heard them talk the most shit about, after NYC), and I’m enjoying paradise weather, amazing water and produce, and friendly worldly people who look happy, healthy and want to chat.  My Uber eats delivery people here look happier, friendlier and more in shape than the average person over there.  

Picky my apt building in Houston got power very quickly so I’ve been able to help out my family and friends in the area."
I've lived here my entire life and I would absolutely leave if I could. Like this article mentions the fact that we insist on having our own power grid in Texas yet it doesn't hold up and doesn't keep us warm and freezing cold temperatures and doesn't keep us cool and sweltering ones is a huge factor. It will be one thing for people to be without power for a week after you know a huge hurricane. This was a category one. And I took it seriously but most people didn't. Everybody kept laughing reactions on Facebook to anybody that was actually had the nerve enough to try to make preparations. I thought about those people when I sat with no power a couple of days later and wondered if they were still laughing. In a state that has such crazy severe weather something needs to change. And they don't seem to be willing to do it.
Demand better. Singular party rule for 25+ years is the root cause. The marketplace of ideas needs to have more than one option.
Definitely broke me.
Yes we could use a few less people
can't blame them
Welp if we want a better city and state start by voting in all levels. Start by remove tjose who keep the unregulated power con going.
CNP profits above all else

Texans had seen that stupid crippled fuck as our governor since 2015 and they still decided to vote him back in. It’s a shame that Texan pride involves getting bent over a barrel and shown the 50 states as long as we have your guns.
"The only people that should have to pay for this are those that failed the people, the executive branch of the state government and anyone who bought their influence to save a buck."
"Everyone should stay, because Texas will be blue in less than 10 years. We can change not only Texas, but the entire country, by prying control away from those that don't give a shit about the greater good."
What are we even getting out of this city? We bust our ass to pay the insane housing costs and we can't even be guaranteed that we'll have the *privilege* of paying $200+ a month for electricity. The schools are in such a shitty state that the teachers themselves are outright telling their students that they don't give a shit. Cars are ending up on blocks overnight all over town and the police can't even be bothered to write a report about it half the time. I live in an expensive luxury apartment in a nice part of town and I still hear gunshots every other night. And whataburger has gone so far downhill that I won't even eat there anymore. The fuck are we doing.
People need to learn to be self reliant. So many who wait on others to take care of them.
"All the weak poles, trees, and branches have fallen.  Next one will be nothing like this was."
"Not gonna lie, if a bunch do, I won't complain. I long for the days of Covid lighter traffic again."
"Later, lol.  Not anything new for us veterans.

Childlike mentality."

Good glad transplants are leaving. That will help ameliorate a lot of the city’s problems.
"It's the lack of resources and change. If the asshole corrupt idiots in charge did something to hold the electric companies accountable and they required finding solutions to the flooding then this would be a different story.

The horror is caused by the storms, the misery is caused by the politicians and utility companies."
One word: Hellscape!!
"Why have people forgotten hurricanes exist?   Why did power companies stop trimming the trees as they did after Rita?     None of this is new, except people’s surprise and power companies lack of preparation.   Beryl was only a Cat 1."
"When the negatives outweigh the positives then Houston will stop growing. Anyone is free to leave, once the jobs, culture and delicious taqueria food aren’t enough."
"GOOD, out with the weak, keep Houston Strong! /s"
Move so yall can complain about something new
"Lower house prices you say?

Sign me up!

That said, this is the pinnacle of right-wing deregulated idiocy meets left-wing cronyism. We need to drop the partisanship and stay and fight!

Edit: not leaving, already have a dual fuel generator, but buying more Ecoflows and upping my emergency supply of food and water to 30 days. Infrastructure is crumbling everywhere, it's just that the crumbling isn't equally distributed. But it's coming to a city near you if it hasn't already arrived."
good riddance
Anybody that would make their sole decision to leave a city based on a Hurricane is a MORON.
People are stupid. You should expect some inconvenience after a storm.  Mother nature can not be controlled.
Houston Strong is such a horrible PR scheme to glorify how much surviving Houstonians are needlessly having to do. I’m not houston strong and I’m not Htown til I drown.
I’m Houston tired boss….
"Houston, we have a problem

finally applies again"
Even the strongest need rest days.
I'm too soft for this shit
"That ""Houston Strong"" shit always struck me as major cope. 

""We aren't too lazy or poor or Stockholm Syndrome'd to leave this shithole, we are Houston Strong!"""
"I would definitely prefer Houston Stable nowadays rather than Houston Strong. Like a stable power grid, stable public education, stable state political climate, etc."
Why are you Houston strong? Literally what is it about this shithole city in this shithole state with officials that hate us that impresses you or fills you with pride?
That's a scary angry tbh
"Every single word you have written is correct. I’ve stayed for ten plus years. My native born Houstonian spouse is finally done. We’re done. We’ve voted, we’ve tried and tried again. We cannot find one reason, outside of spouse’s family, to stay in this city, let alone this state any longer. I’m finishing up my degree in state, and we’re finally throwing in the towel. 

It’s not safe anymore. For me and my fertility issues (we’d like a kid, it’s *really* not safe for me here, given my “condition”), weather wise, and state government wise. 

We’re planning to be out within the next two years. It didn’t need to come to this, but here we are, and here we stand. Sucks, tbh, I actually like Houston most of the time, but above the Mason-Dixon line we go."
What this person said
Pretty sure there is only one state party (R) that controls everything that refuses to fix anything. I have yet to see a D come out and say “I won’t back a bill to fix the grid”.
“It’s too expensive” is the popular excuse people use against any sort of fixing or regulation of the power grid here and it’s the weakest argument I’ve heard. We’re talking about people’s livelihoods here. I shouldn’t have to feel obligated to buy a house and then buy a generator in order to survive every time the wind is blowing a little too hard
"Regulation the way you think of it, won’t fix the issues we’re having. Infrastructure upgrades and demanding repairs and weatherproofing is what fixes it."
"The “priceyness” of your neighborhood has nothing to do with your neighborhood getting power back quickly. 

Some areas of Piney Point Village just recently got their power restored. $3-7M homes there."
Surfside Beach.. we are silly beach bums dumb enough to stay.
"> I'm Houston Getting Da Fuq Outta Here.

i hope some people do leave, its not because i don't like you its because there's too many people here. 

Please leave, thanks!"
Yay climate change.
"This was my husband's reasoning. We left after the Feb freeze, our kid was 1. We moved out of state right after he turned 2. 

I do miss the food though. We come back to visit a few times a year at least."
"Yea, this is the one I am worried about. 

My store can't make any money when the power goes out. Not to mention, I work with perishables, and the landlord doesn't give any rent reductions or extensions. 

It's a really uncertain time being a business owner."
Can you post some data. It’s always been this way lol. There have been worst years.
"Where are you going and what did you have to do to prepare, if I may ask? Or are you fleeing to family/friends? I’m planning on leaving as well, but taking 2 years-ish to plan and finally make my grand exit."
Same reason we came back after being gone for 15 years.  Family magnetism.  Can’t choose where you grew up. We’re making the best of it.
I keep telling my family members that I'm leaving when I'm done with my degree. Not in a malicious way but just friendly reminders so they're not in shock when I pull up stakes and GTFO to the high desert of the American Southwest.
"I feel you. My family is all within an hour of each other here.

We just decided to invest in one house to get a new generator 🙃"
"Born in Houston, moved to San Antonio when I was 30, been here the past 5 years, you couldn't pay me enough to move back. 

There's actual stuff to do outside here, Hill country and Austin are an hour away, you don't have to pay tolls to drive on the roads, traffic isn't as bad, we don't get hurricanes, the Mexican food is better, the list goes on."
"I'm going back to Dallas later this year. I'm from DFW and I've never put any stock into our stupid rivalry. People from Dallas say Houston is a trash heap, people from Houston say Dallas is full of uncultured snobs. I really don't care about that. The food in Houston is great and I like the general atmosphere.

But other than that, maybe it's just bad timing, but this is the worst place I've ever lived. All around DFW and satellite burbs, Waco, San Antonio, freaking Longview. But the past year in Houston has been the worst of my life. This city is actually falling the fuck apart. If a cat 4 or 5 ever comes through, there'll be no slow recovery like after Katrina. Houston will be wiped off the map.

I'm going back to tornado country. At least my power doesn't go out when it rains up there. I've had more power outages in Houston since January than I've had, collectively, in my entire life. And I've got more than two options (one, really) for internet service."
"Born raised in Houston, but San Antonio is home now. It’s such a massive quality of life upgrade."
It makes me imagine what would probably happen if a category 2 or higher were to hit.
"It looks like Houston became more populated, if I'm reading it correctly?"
"They hadn't even gotten it all cleaned up from the tornado, or ""derecho"" as people seem to be calling it. Is that the approach now? Just leave it because the next one will be coming soon anyway?"
"Sure, it also had the worst possible track for the Houston metro, and sustained those Cat 1 winds into Harris county. The last storm do bring Cat 1 winds into Harris county was Ike, a higher category storm with a more favorable track for Houston metro."
Why do yall morons keep saying it like that? As if a CAT one is nothing. It has winds gusts upwards 70 mph over a period of I believe 9 hours. You say that as though it’s a light spring rain.
"Chicago and Minneapolis are on my list of cities to research. I've visited both a few times and loved them. Which neighborhoods would you recommend? I'm all for an artsy/queer community, but I'm a single woman, so I mostly just want to be safe."
Let me guess... young X or older Y gen?
This definitely came at the worse possible time ever.
How long did you lose power for ? Just wondering if that’s something someone would think not having lost power for over a week
"Oh I won't forget, and I won't let my friends and family forget when it's time to vote."
"If Abbott got reelected after people froze in their homes in Houston, and he did nothing to hold anyone accountable, yeah. Agreed."
"Not a transplant, I've lived here for 30 years, born and raised. I have watched Houston change dramatically over just the last few years in many ways. 

My advice is to move back at your own caution and carefully consider how the political climate will effect you and your family and how the increasing severity and frequency of weather events will effect you as well. These are subjective topics but the biggest pressing ones I see discussed and ones I would consider seriously before coming back especially if you plan to stay for the long term."
"Houston is great if you want to save money. CA is great if you want to enjoy life

I lived in Houston throughout my twenties and it allowed me to travel the world, buy a house, get married, build a retirement fund, etc

Now that I’m in my mid-thirties, I’m desperately begging my wife to let me move us back to CA. We have enough money to live in a nicer place. I hate it in this godforsaken concrete patch"
"Don’t just go off this sub. It’s full of hateful, dramatic transplants. A guy in here literally mentioned being held at gunpoint many times as if though that is normal here and everyone goes through it. I have plenty of friends who didn’t lose power in either storm."
"Let's not forget that the federal government was on standby ready to act with assistance, but can't do so without being asked by the governer, who was out of the fucking country and supposedly unavailable, yet was tweeting out support of Donald Trump within half an hour of him being shot at."
Yes a casual 15k out the door.
"I’d look into getting one you can hook up yourself, save you 8k with a soft start applied to the AC and a 50v plug installed with an easy switch to the breaker. Even with hiring companies to install these things for you will save you tons."
I know there are some new build communities on the east side that are building homes with in-home generators.
I was thinking about getting those that attch to the gas line since that is the last service to fail in most disasters.
"I moved from Houston in 2009, and it’s been interesting seeing people’s reactions change over time when I tell them I’m from here. They used to not know a single thing about it outside the sports teams, then they knew it had good food (thanks Bourdain), then from Harvey on they tend to give me a sad, sympathy face. Y’all don’t deserve all this, Houstonians."
Don't despair. You have weathered worse and you will again.
The CEO of CenterPoint came from PG&E where multi-billion dollars of damage was done from wildfires which were started due to lack of tree maintenance around power lines.
"When their power is out, they're gonna leave.

When the power comes back, they're relieved but still irritated.

A month later, they've forgotten all about it. Until the next time, then they want to leave again."
"Right?! When I told people that I had my neighbors, who still didn’t have power, stayed over they kept telling me how generous and kind it was. It was really confusing because to me that’s just what you do as a Houstonian."
"Weather in San Diego has been business as usual. Maybe more ""June gloom"" with each passing year. The weird flooding we had from a small rainfall was because the city didn't clear the storm drains. 

Local governments are probably the largest contributing factors to the quality of life woes, but the storms don't help the situation at all."
"I'm not complaining.
I voted Republican in the past. Will keep voting Republican.
Disasters happen and are part of life. We do our best to pick up after them as do others.

Centerpoint is a utility company that operates under ERCOT, a non-profit grid operator that is nearly identical in structure to NYISO (New York states non-profit grid operator).

The mayor, city council, etc. Don't really have much oversight over centerpoint, so even though people are frustrated the local elections really have little to do with centerpoint or other local utility companies.

I expect that an investigation into Centerpoints practices will be performed by ERCOT and if they are found deficient consequences will be applied similarly to how other states with an ISO or RTO handles their grid. The net profit Centerpoint is allowed to take is typically decreased if a utility is found deficient and if their is significant negligence board members can be asked to step down.

I often see people talking negatively about ERCOT but I've never seen EarCOT really behaving badly or inappropriately. At least Texas has an ISO. There are many parts of the country with no Independent System Operator where the utilkty companies can act without any oversight at all. Literally half of the country is still like this. I don't think people appreciate how good we actually have it. We have some of the cheapest energy prices in the nation and the only states that beat us on cost have almost no one living in them (Nebraska, Oklahoma, etc.)."
"Dallas is a really good option to have a family there, esp the north Dallas area, I moved there from Houston 2 years ago and never regret it. So many points to consider but overall the quality of life is way better than Houston, not sure of Atlanta though"
"There are cheaper places in the US than Houston but you're absolutely right in that it won't be in California. 

The states that border Canada might not be poppin' or have a diverse population, nightlife, or cuisine, but they definitely have patches of land available cheaper than Houston. Although I imagine property values in Houston are about to start sliding if everybody here follows thru and leaves."
"Not the best of times to be listing a home for sale, inventory rapidly approaching pre-covid levels.  Demand remains near all time lows.

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ACTLISCOU26420](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ACTLISCOU26420)"
you really want to change Texas into California?  Why don’t you just move to California?
"sure so we can look like Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, New York or any other blue run states and cities. No thanks. I’ll keep voting for anyone except the Judge Crazy Lina and Beto types. I may not like some of their policies, but we have a huge cash surplus in the state and we aren’t broke like those blue states you prefer."
"Yeah, you’re right. Who needs Centerpoint? We should have all been up on those poles restoring our own electricity. Ridiculous to think the company we pay a fuckton of money to specifically to provide electricity should handle it.

Fuck it. Next time, I’ll be ready with my stationary bike, an alternator, and a battery, and I’ll make my own power! #peddle4kilowatts"
"It isn’t just the power outages. The summers are getting hotter, the floods more frequent, and the storms more damaging. 

Houston is rapidly becoming unlivable."
Where I want to move I can get 10 acres and an equivalent house for the price of my Houston house and taxes and insurance are way less. So you got no idea what you are saying
Didn't know the transplants were the ones in charge of the grid. You learn something new everyday!
Dude apparently wouldn't go.
"I think this is pretty annoying. I recently moved and I’m starting to like the difference in weather. I think you are like me we’re you’re getting tired of these posts. However, I think when you add it all up, you really cannot beat Texas and Houston for that matter in overall benefit o"
"There it is. The stupidest thing I’ll read all day , thank you sir or madam"
What else can you expect from this weak sorry ass sub of transplants?
"There is a difference between ""some inconvenience"" and going two weeks without electricity in sweltering heat. "
"Right, It’s all an online movement more than what it really is in reality.


Nobody says they’re Houston strong irl that shit is cringe. it’s like those “we’re a family” work speeches."
"I hate the attitude of, ""Houston gets hurricanes. You just need to own a house and a full-house generator or solar panels and batteries and some coolers and a kayak stop complaining."" If you are prepared and have the money to be prepared, that's great. But this is not normal for living in a city. I had a boss who after Harvey said that people should really only depend on their neighbors, and it's not up to the government to provide electricity. Like I don't know what you expect the government to do if they can't provide basic utilities reliably."
I prefer Houston Pissed
"I went to Vegas after the mass shooting and saw “Vegas Strong” banners over the strip. Last that summer, I went to Wimberely after the shouldn’t-have-happened-flood and saw “Wimberely Strong” banners over the main road. I hate these signs. Just make policies that keep people safe and let us live peacefully!! I’m a hell of a lot stronger with working infrastructure, a habitable climate, and not shot up."
Many cities / states do the ‘strong’ thing after a disaster. Panama City did it after hurricane Michael.  Houston isn’t special with using that moniker.
I don't know exactly where it started but it almost certainly started as an online meme (after a mass shooting perhaps?). And it's not exclusive to Houston either. It's any city or town that has a disaster or tragedy happen. Never been a fan of it.
"I didn’t say pride… at all. 

Strong means I’m capable to (more specifically FORCED to) handle all of the shit thrown my way by living here. Got it? Good."
The bitchyness of r/houston is pretty impressive.
"Same man, I have endometriosis and a torn ovary. My chances of ectopic pregnancy are quite high, Texas took away my safety of continuing to try for a child."
"I completely agree. My heart hurts for you and so many others put in this position. My husband and I are currently saving up to leave and like you, family is the only thing that makes us hesitate but at the end of the day, we have to do what’s best for our child. And I firmly believe staying here is not in their best interest and I refuse to force them to grow up here. I would maybe think about more children someday but I will not be pregnant here again. I got very lucky the first time with only mild complications and so many women aren’t, it’s truly terrifying. I feared the worst every single day. 

Sending hugs to you both, it is so hard, and it feels like we’ve lost on some level. But I am so hopeful we will all make it to places better suited for us and our kiddos. Keep going <3"
"Man I’m starting to feel this way and I’ve only been here around 5 years. But when the time comes for my next move I’m debating leaving.  Even though my dream industry is here (aerospace and nasa) maybe it’s better to have a place I’ll enjoy living and work somewhere as similar as I can get.  

It just sucks so much that Houston (and Texas) isn’t better.  I’ve read so much about the previous potential and even the potential now….but it just doesn’t seem to ever come into play

Plus I’m gonna miss a lot of the people, coming from a north state the people here definitely do seem just friendlier on average, or more outgoing on average, and that I’ll miss"
Were you guys here when Ike hit?
"LMAO! 

You guys actually STILL think a hurricane hitting the most populated part of the Gulf coast is a grid issue. Sheep keep on baaaaing."
Infrastructure upgrades and demanding repairs and weatherproofing is what fixes it- so who makes a private company do this? If we're going to be all about capitalism we need and equally strong government to not be screwed by corporations. People hate overbearing government but you can vote those people out- what can customers with no other utility options do? This isn't beer you can boycott.
"Do you think we could maybe... regulate (mandate)... weatherproofing... and... repairs?

Hope that was slow enough for you."
Utilities won't pay for those repairs without proper regulation.
"Regulation is what gets those repairs done.


For profit companies don't do shit for anyone without regulations. That's how for profit companies work. "
If we got onto the national grid it would force them to upgrade the infrastructure to be up to regulations
"You are literally trying to convince extremists of something they have indoctrinated into believing is “wrong”. 

Hint: it ain’t happening. 😂"
"I get it. I would be a beach bum too if I could…one day. 

I feel like when you live right on the gulf though, there is implied consent so to speak… you  know that if it’s your year for a hurricane, you can expect shit to get real fucked up. However, people close to 100 miles inland should not be without power for 2 weeks because of a cat 1 hurricane.  I think that is what is driving people away."
"There's way better beaches, man."
Is Windswept still down there?
"Slowly getting back to normal. Waiting for the restaurants to reopen. Beach is amazing, went down yesterday and it's nearly deserted."
"…nobody even surfs at surfside beach, that’s how bad that beach is"
This is a sacrifice I'm willing to make! 
Agreed.
"as a 5th gen Houstonian, this is precisely why I want to leave. I don’t want my children to feel stuck just because they grew up here."
My whole family is ready to move lol. We decided if family is the only thing keeping us here all 4 of our households are ready to go elsewhere
"> There's actual stuff to do outside here,

As someone who grew up here pre 2000: what?!

There is very little to do outside here, because who would want to be outside here?!"
"Do you have kids? How are the schools? For some reason, I always imagined Houston would have most of the same problems as San Antonio."
The Mexican food is better?? Please elaborate!
You just doomed the DFW area with no electricity karma this winter when the area gets a winter freeze and ice storm.
From the Florida gulf coast and I fully agree with you. More power outages here in 4 years than 20+ years there. We also lived on a peninsula in Boston Harbor and blizzards and nor’easters would shake our house to its core—but the power stayed on.
"Oh, so you’re the bad luck!!

Ha ha JK   wish you the best man"
Damn you know it’s bad when you mention my hometown of Longview! Lol
"From Houston, now living in Dallas, not really much tornados but power has been going out after a little storm here and there and the winters have gotten brutal. It’s a hit or a miss.
I do agree since moving up here almost 2 years ago, Houston has fallen down hill, I see it. I hear it, all my family and friends are in Houston and all have been affected from the storm, the crazy thing is a lot of my family members are workers of centerpoint, the company failed alot of their people and the communities. 


-My point though for those reallly considering to move, Dallas is a good place to choose. It’s cleaner (I’m in the north Dallas area) the people are nice. Dallas people DAF about this Houston hate they have on Dallas. Literally so unbothered by it lol there’s a lot of good food out there I know it took some time to find!!!!! 

At this very moment still lots of up coming development for housing and businesses opportunities that could be very well yours. You’ll be close to everything you need. 

-downsides are you’re not close to the hill country, but Dallas isn’t flat ass Houston sea level! 
-not much nature but hey lot of suburbs and urban life that Houstonians are familiar with. 
-The tolls are worse here IMO.

-but their DART transit system has improved. Still see tons of foreigners and diversity! The schools are good out here (Frisco, McKinney, Plano). 

I don’t regret moving out here, just wish my friends who are stuck in this Houston ego to get TF out and realize Dallas is a good place 😂"
Can you have a basement in Dallas?
For one of the largest cities in the country San Antonio is mainly a tourist trap. Only have the Spurs. Not much in the way of nightlife and it’s a sprawled dirty mess like Houston. Food is getting better but nothing like Houston.
"2-3 weeks without power instead of 1.  
Basically just whatever category the hurricane is will be how many weeks we lose power at this rate"
"Yes, 5% gain in three years"
"A Cat 1 isn’t nothing, but an area that’s so prone to hurricanes should be designed to handle a Cat 1 with little issue."
"Used to live in Chicago, now in Houston. Always felt safer in Chicago, tbh. Especially driving in Houston, my God. Take your life in your hands when you do it."
"My partner and I moved from Houston to Uptown Chicago last year and we LOVE it here. We miss Houston food and diversity a ton but Chicago feels safer in a variety of ways and overall we’re much happier here with public transit, walkability, and politics. I’m happy trading the Houston summers for Chicago winters, but my partner would rather be in the heat than cold so that’s the big downside for them. Feel free to dm if you wanna hear more at all :)"
"I grew up in Spring so I wanted to find similar burbs. I live near Schaumburg and it’s a nice and safe part of town. I lived in Texas for 40 years and had guns pointed at me multiple times. Up here I’ve never had that experience, and TBH I can’t remember ever feeling threatened here. 

The queer community is underwhelming in this are, but burbs are rarely great for that. Elgin has a decent artsy community and it recently won some award for safest and most affordable city or something."
Agree. These are the main reasons I left Houston (and Texas generally) last year.
"this is so relatable. I moved to houston from CA because i wanted to afford more and establish my footing financially. just couldn’t do that in CA, but once i have more money and more choices, i would never in a million years choose to stay in houston."
Not when you just add a 50v plug install a soft start on the ac and an easy switch on the breaker. Of course you’re still spending close to 5k with the generator included but you save a lot more for doing mostly the same thing. This is even with companies coming to install these things for you.
"Not necessarily.  The $2k tri-fuel ones and some DIY skills will get a pretty decent result, or so I’m told."
Look at a portable one that is tri fuel and has enough wattage to run a fridge and window AC. Should be <$1000 before tax.
"Not sure how the market is now, but I had a Generac 26 kW installed through Costco for 15k plus a reward Costco cash card (like $1200). this included every aspect of the installation and hardware as well as permits. The quote was from last summer, but the installation didn’t happen till the fall. I’m assuming that now the prices have shot up due to demand, though. The generator pulled us through for the six days we were without power."
"And they fucking break constantly too. I know at least three people who didn't even make it the first day, the generac generators about at brittle as anything centerpoint builds. The others cost even more."
15K is an under estimate
"Reddit: you lost power because you didn't spend enough on your generator

Also reddit: you don't need to break the bank to get a good generator! Just get a used one for $500. Also, it's not an option if you live in an apartment and it will explode the first time you use it if you don't put oil in it every two weeks. Also also, don't store it with oil in it. Piece of cake!"
Just make sure you're load aware and check the amps on those generators. The max amperage is startling sometimes.
same. the.firman trifuel natural gas generator thats like 8000/10000 cost only 2-3k and is enoughto power whole house Ac that has soft start.
Fruit fly memory
"Ya know, now that you mention it, San Diego is pretty nice."
You typed all this without searching about the topic on Google first?
Google “deregulation” your mind is about to be blown.
Absolutely - would I want to see a Beto running this state? No!
"I do think DFW as a metro is much better than Houston especially if you have a family. With me I’m just tired of the state’s political landscape that and I’m not sure I can justify moving to another city in the state that’s significantly more expensive and has a less interesting urban core than Houston within the state. 

Hadn’t completely ruled it out though."
"Not having anything to do while living in a ""neighborhood"" where the average age is 57 is a bit of a problem.

The land up there is cheap for a reason.

You either pay with money, or with a degraded quality of life."
"There have been a little over 300 people comment on this thread (at this time) and not all of them are considering leaving. If 300 families move out, it won't be a blip at all on property values. And the void will be quickly replaced by people moving in to take their place."
"Sweet baby Jesus finally.

I don't notice it in my housing search, but happy the overall inventory level is getting back to normal around here."
Then why are my property taxes rising goshdarnit?!
[removed]
This doesn't even begin to mention how the government is impinging on Texans freedoms constantly. Doctors don't want to come here because they can't take care of their patients fully. Women don't want to be here because they can't get proper medical care. At least Greg Abbott got rid of rape in Texas though /S
"Like I totally get it with the storms etc but honestly  Houston isn’t that bad compared to other places. The state over from you Louisiana where I came from has been hit and hit by storms, floods, high insurance, no jobs, low pay and horrible education and much more. Houston is a bayou the summers suck and CenterPoint is trash But honestly it could be worse than you think."
"No doubt lots of reasons to move, but I just don't think that a hurricane should be the primary reason.

In regards to your statement about weather, that applies to nearly the entire contental US right now though.  Dealing with 95deg heat in Boston / Seattle with the shittiest of shitty portable of a/c units is not fun either.

My home temperature in the summer was lower in Houston than CT because the costs of electricity is double what I paid in Houston.

By all means I encourage people to move, but there's lots of reason why TX / FL, despite hurricanes & shitt weather are still the top states to relocate to."
"do tell, what's the average income & school ratings there?

I know exactly what I'm saying"
"Why do you idiots keep saying that? Can you read? I said “a lot of the city’s problems.” Like traffic, rising home prices, higher rates of crime, etc."
"Mofos acting like this is the first major disaster and life is just completely over. I've lived outside of Texas and outside of the states Bubba, go on if you think the grass is greener"
Where did you move from?
It sucks for sure but you can’t expect everything to be fixed in a couple days. Can you fix your own house that quick if a tree falls through the roof?
Right???? I’m just wondering when the governor is going to send us a pizza party.
"White women love that shit. I was at the vet and some old white lady was wearing a Houston Strong shirt and was basically bragging about how she lost her house during Harvey and didn't have power for 5 days during Beryl. My mom's the same way. Idk if it's a white woman thing or just people who love playing victim...either way, seems to be a lot of overlap lol."
"Yeah, who needs a government?  Just get all of your neighbors to pitch in the resources they have at their disposal, and then distribute them as needed by the neighborhood.  

You should probably also have someone whose job it is to manage and distribute these resources, possibly chosen by a voting process.  

Then to make sure they’re doing a good job, we set time limits, at which point they have to either be re-elected or step down. 

/s"
This is precisely why Louisiana has their “Cajun Navy”. They have generation after generation voted for the most useless grifters again and again. They have to be self sufficient because they can’t vote themselves into getting real help.
This
"This is what we do on my road and we get through it fine, hell with each scenario we become closer friends."
Too true. I have grieved what has happened and is happening to Wimberly for years. I grew up going there and got married there.
"Hm yeah, was it Vegas maybe? Or Boston after the bombing?"
“A bitching Sailor is a happy Sailor.” At least that’s what they used to tell us.
"I had a TFMR almost 9 years ago. My baby literally didn’t have a brain. Today, I’d have to go out of state or carry until birth. Which would likely not be full term even *if* he’d still been “alive” inside of me at that point. If he was, he most likely would have died during birth, and if not, within a few hours."
Most of TX is better. But the state is trying to strangle the cities into submission and the city leaders are mostly on the take. Guessing this comes to a boiling point if the news cycle doesn't get us talking about the Kardashians and the royals again.
[deleted]
They are using “the grid” as a catch all for the electrical system and I think you know that.
"Based upon OC’s comment history, regulations as in pricing regulations is what they were referring to. Legislative regulation to retrofit and upgrade existing lines while weatherproofing them is literally what I stated in my second sentence. Reading comprehension is important."
How would you weather proof all the lines in Houston?
"There isn't a national grid. We're in the ""Texas"" grid but the counties east of us are part of the South East grid. El Paso is part of a grid that includes California and all of Western Canada. The pan handle is part of a different grid that is connected to central Canada."
"Yeah, it’s weird how what actually fixes it got downvoted lmao"
"Right, lol. I think this might be literally the very first time I've ever heard of someone moving or sticking around here because of the beaches."
Very much. Lots of missing roofs. The iconic A-frames fell apart.
It’s not a sacrifice. Focus on having a better quality of life. If that involves leaving then make the most of your life. Any body else with an opinion can shut the f up or help you pack up.
The other side of the coin is that my kids were little here and we moved away.  They have felt super isolated being away from family.  We moved back for them and helping take care of elderly in-laws.  My kids are stoked to be here.
"Sure San Antonio gets hot like the rest of Texas. But as for things to do outside... Government canyon, Friedrich wilderness Park, greenbelt, canyon lake, Riverwalk, Comanche lookout, SeaWorld, six flags, the pearl, plenty of farmers markets, etc"
Houstonians that are used to 100 degree swamp
"Don't get me wrong I do love Houston's Mexican food, but imo San Antonio just has more authentic and better tasting Mexican food. Not as good as RGV, but it's pretty close."
"Man I'd play online games and stream movies during Cat 1s and 2s in Florida. Been in houston barely a year and lost power 4 times, 2 of them during no name heavy rainstorms"
3 very great different types of plants in those places. And weather. And everything.
"Technically, yes. But North Texas doesn't have good ground for them. Storm shelters are a little more common, but there still aren't too many.

DFW gets a tornado once every couple of years, but it's hardly ever bad. It's on the edge of tornado alley."
"Agreed and some of these glowing comments about SA are interesting to me. Literally everyone I know that has lived in SA has hated it, including me. They either came back to Houston or moved somewhere else within 3-4 years. "
That’s fine and sensible to say. But that’s not what they’re saying. They’re acting like a CAT 1 hurricane is a nice summer storm. Tell that to all the poor trees.
"The driving has gotten out of hand the past couple of years. I used to be pretty chill and just have an ""Oh well, it's Houston"" attitude about the bad drivers, but the reckless stupidity on display here is on a completely different level now. I've never been so anxious about driving here, and I'm a native."
"That's the only thing I'm scared of: cold weather. I put a jacket on if it's below 75 out. I take a zip up hoodie/sweater to the grocery store in summer. I'm fine with Texas heat! 😂

I may dm you with a couple of questions. Thank you!"
"Thanks! I'll have to keep that area in mind. I can always drive into the city. 

I moved to an area off of I-10 here to be closer to my mom, and now gunshots and muggings are more of a thing than where I was living. And of course she moves in with her boyfriend to a nice neighborhood a few months after I get here, lol. So yeah, looking to get settled somewhere nice, myself."
Ugh I got offered a position in Schaumburg a few years ago. Wish I had taken it.
Lived in Houston my whole life and never had a gun pointed at me. Don’t even know anyone in my family and circle of friends except one who has. What kind of lifestyle do you lead?
"Worked in Elgin and a few of the Chicago burbs, they are boring as hell. To enjoy Chicago you have to be in the loop, never felt unsafe but you get into some parts of town and it is a combat zone."
"I’ve got a NEMA 14-50 outlet in my garage that is connected directly to the breaker, currently use it to charge my car. Sounds like I’m half way there? Should probably just go to Lowe’s or Home Depot and ask them what I need…"
Still gotta source gas tho
"Honestly if you’re going tri fuel and feeding directly into your home, you might as well do the math on how much wattage you need to run a full AC. 

Our 4 ton AC ran fine during beryl with just a 7500/10000 (nat gas) starting wattage unit. We don’t even have a soft start on the AC. If you’re going to pay for the electric and natural gas hookup might as well consider a few hundred more for the generator itself so you can run the whole AC."
Generac for a home gen is garbage.
Some of the generacs seem to need a team of engineers babysitting them
Generac is cheap chinese garbage. Get a Kohler or Cummings
"It's changed a lot since covid, but that's more to do with the increasing COL and homeless population/crime.

But we can't really complain about the weather! 

Stay tuned for the city's handling of infrastructure issues when/if the big earthquake hits... or any other natural disaster. I'm gonna wager that it's not gonna be pretty, on a local or state level."
It doesn't mean what you think it means in this setting.
"Yeah, but I'd also counter that the average person isn't taking to reddit to discuss their future plans. Either way, Houston COL doesn't seem all that great if you have to invest in larger generators and fuel and storm maintenance or risk losing fridges full of food and your sanity when it rains or freezes.

I guess I underestimate how much people are willing to change about their situations vs how quickly they will complain about the consequences of their inaction and how it doesn't get enough national airtime 🤷‍♀️"
Because Miles needs to send more money to his sister's failing schools in Colorado.
I see you didn’t address anything to do with how these blue states have failed their citizens. And thanks for the redneck comment and the fact that I don’t watch Fox News and I happen to work for the government but thank you very much for your inept response.
"The hurricane just crystallized the issues. If the city can’t withstand a Cat 1 storm, we are doomed long term."
"It’s not just maintaining a generator. I’m looking into cutting down some trees in my backyard and I’m looking at at least $5k to prevent any further damage during a storm. It’s not just my trees, my neighbors tree fell on my property and damaged my fence and home. He has another tree in the front yard in close proximity to my house and refuses to do any maintenance on it. It’s always something when it comes to the weather here."
"Matters little to me when I can work from anywhere in the country what the average income is. School ratings compare to Houston, but my wife is a teacher and the teacher salary there is waaaaaay higher than here so…."
I’m sorry arguing on the internet and downvoting people is a source of entertainment for you. I hope you have more self esteem someday. ❤️
"Been here 30 years, born and raised. You need to go travel if you seriously think Houston is a good place to live. I'm sad for you. Enjoy the swamp bubba."
Hell I have tons of friends who didn’t lose power during either storm or lost it for a few hours. Yet by the way people talk here their lives were completely ruined and will never recover.
From TX to NC.
Only if you accept “school choice” first.
I’ve made the same observation lol
...and you have to fund it somehow- maybe make everyone chip in... hm... I think you're on to something!
"First I ever saw it was Boston after the marathon race bombings. Thought it was stupid then, too."
"I want to say I first saw it after Sandy Hook, but there's been so many tragedies that I couldn't call it"
"Popeye, is that you?"
I’m so sorry ❤️
"I went through every major storm from Ike through present day.  Ike was far worse, never lost power for Harvey, and only intermittent power loss on everything else up until this storm.

Outside of burying the lines or cutting down all the trees, I'm not sure what else they can do about it other than being prepared."
"Then why are they pretending it’s political. 😂

Politics literally live rent free 24/7/365 in these people’s heads my friend. 

The indoctrination is real."
"I imagine it's not impossible if you have to do it... the rest of the world manages! I'm from a backwood swampy ass eastern european town like houston, except it gets WAY colder in the winter, and they did it, way back in 1945!

But this is the gun owner's logic fallacy by the way, if I can't solve it in one fell swoop, why even bother trying, right?"
You’re getting hung up on semantics. When I say “national grid” I’m referring to the interconnections. Texas isn’t part of either the west nor east interconnection and doesn’t have to meet those standards like the rest of the country. There’s no technical reason why they can’t it’s all political.
"Because it go with the r/houston extremist narrative my friend. 

It is VERY difficult to change the mind of an extremist. They actually believe that they are right no matter what. And if you don’t agree with them and their beliefs you are viewed as the enemy."
"It's nice when you live in a town of 300 year round. It's a big family that goes surfing and fishing any opportunity. The water stinks, the infrastructure sucks, but it's beach life not too far out from necessities."
But Surfside > Galveston!
"Oh no!  I grew up in Lake Jackson and spent many a Saturday in the 80’s, driving up and down the beach with friends and taking in the “scenery”"
I loved those a-frames. 😞
Oh I thought you meant here as in Houston. I know all about San Antonio's many attractions.
"Oh, I wasn't defending Houston. I was asking for help and looking for directions. I've been to SA a few times and I want to know where the good stuff is"
"I lead a pretty sensible lifestyle. I volunteer in my community, I manage people for work, I have sensible friends."
"Not quite, you’d need an inlet you can feed electricity into. You have an outlet. You also need to be able to lockout the breaker so that it prevents you from connecting to the generator while connected to the grid. Backfeeding electricity improperly can kill people thinking they’re working with an offline grid."
"Tagging in on this and saying that if you're sizing your generator to power all that to also size your fuel line too. 

My tri-fuel generator takes 250,000 BTH/h (225 cubic feet) to run at full load. My gas meter is rated for 250 cuf, but I've seen some people only have a meter rated for 175 cuf and it was throttling the generator. 

I did a quick emergency hookup to a tee off my 1/2"" line to my hot water heater, but I'm looking into plumbing a 1"" connection straight from the meter to be ready for next time."
Ok cool
"Over the past few years I've learned that we can't handle cat1 storms, weather that's too cold, or weather that's too hot. So basically the only time we can feel secure with our power is... Idk spring?"
"Really? What happened to you in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2022 and 2023 since it’s always something."
Dude. Just answer where this place is.
Kettle meet pot. 😂 You’re the one commenting on several of my comments in not exactly a friendly manner. ❤️
Some people's lives were ruined. People literally died.
Pizza party but it’s at a charter school in Colorado 🥴
"As a white woman, it's infuriating lol"
"My story has a happy ending. I got pregnant 6 months later and he’s about to be in 2nd grade. 

I like to say that the hole in my heart has healed, but there will always be a scar."
"Please explain how one party being in full power in this state for 26 years straight and doing nothing to regulate a utility while also empowering them to be a monopoly is not political.

Baaaaaaah yourself. Don’t even know what you’re talking about."
"I mean, to a certain extend all aspects of our life are political. 

The Republicans want to control who you love, how you have sex, what chemicals you can/can't take into your body, what medical procedures you can do (or when), etc.

They want to take your choice away by making it hard to vote, which should be the easiest thing to do.

So... yeah. Something as simple as providing basic services has become political."
"It is political. Are you stupid? The only reason Texas hasn't adopted precautions and practices to prevent and mitigate outages is because the Republican politicians have pushed so hard against federal regulation. 

Like wow, being this stupid and calling others sheep? Learn some cause and effect please."
So don't even bother answering a good faith question... Gotcha.
"I'm not getting hung up on semantics. It doesn't make sense because a quarter of Texas isn't even part of the ""Texas"" grid. It has nothing to do with politics.

But assuming you are right that this is all political. The Southeastern grid, could be called the ""Confederate Grid"" because it's nothing but ex-confederate states. Do you think that would be better? And the other two grids we can connect to are made up of mostly states that vote red. I don't think they'll be any better."
Weird how that directly aligns with the voting bloc of the city as well…. Lmao
That's as fair a reason as any I've seen. More power to you. Literally.
Ohhhhh lol yeah there's absolutely nothing worth doing in Houston lol or if ther is I wasn't able to find it 😂
Ok but do you think your experience is representative of the majority of people in Houston? Most of us haven’t had guns pointed at us even once.
"Yeah my neighbor has a generator in his garage (dont do this, carbon monoxide kills) and he fired it up, then the lights in our house turned on for a few seconds, and went out exactly when he stopped the generator. He fired it up a few minutes later without it happening again, so I assume he forgot to throw the swit h to isolate the house from the grid the first time and was accidentally powering us too for a moment."
"What? And then make it about arguing something besides the data? I used to be a die hard, I’ll never leave Texas because fuk everywhere else. But once I honestly started looking at the data of places outside of Texas, it’s a no brainer."
You’ve initiated each interaction. Nice try though.
Did I say no one’s life was ruined or no one died? 99.99999999% of the people in this sub did not have their life ruined 🙄
"Exactly. Like, Brenda, having your home destroyed by a natural disaster is not the flex you think it is, but here’s that attention you ordered I guess."
Because Centerpoint is in Harris County. And the “one party” you speak of doesn’t run Harris county or Houston. 😂
Harris County and Houston is ran by Republicans. Wowzers!
"Dude, I'm no civil engineer, but I have lived all over the world! Are you saying it's impossible?"
"I don’t know where you’re getting your information but It’s just wrong. 


TRE (which controls all of Texas of texas) is maintained as a separate grid for political, rather than technical reasons,[1] but can draw some power from other grids using direct current DC ties.


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Interconnection

There’s a nice map showing you the connection and there so El Paso is separate on it"
Practically every major city
"I lived in San Antonio for two years and was bored out of my mind. I've lived in Houston most of my life and I've never been bored here. Yeah, San Antonio has the Hill Country, but you can only go hiking in different spots so many times until it just becomes a routine walk."
Because I want to leave Houston and I am curious.
Replying to kl2342...You really are brain dead. You responded to my comment in this thread.
Troll
"The public power utility that had the cheapest electric in the nation was dismantled by Republicans. Wowzers, dumbass."
"I just asked if you had any ideas, based on your answer you don't, could have just left it at that.

Have a good one."
"> I don’t know where you’re getting your information but It’s just wrong.

From reasoning, and not a Wikipedia page citing a blog from 2003 as it's single source. Why would it need to stay off of these other right wing libertarian grids to avoid regulations?

>TRE (which controls all of Texas of texas) 

>There’s a nice map showing you the connection and there so El Paso is separate on it

You're either drunk/stoned, or malfunctioning AI. I think it's the latter."
"Fair. Personally as someone who grew up in a city with no real hiking opportunities living somewhere where you can doesn't get boring, even after multiple visits. What would you say Houston offers that keeps you entertained?"
I rather walk in some beautiful hills then walk……no where beautiful?
"Check out the interior of Washington state. My sister is moving to the coast, but I’m more interested in the interior climate wise and smaller communities. But the whole state has less people than Houston 😂"
"Listen, listen, when do we kiss and make up. The tension is palpable 😘"
????
Is it because they had monopoly?
"Typically it requires taking down the lines and burying them, encasing them in steel pipes with conduit inside, or encasing them in concrete runners along the ground. Not all power lines can be buried, but a good 2/3 could be encased or buried to weatherproof them from floods, trees, debris, etc. 

The main transmission lines would still need to be exterior and open to nature, but they’re not the ones that are typically knocked down by debris and trees. The immediate areas would look far better without the ghetto ass lines hanging everywhere too."
"So forgot my Wikipedia link because it has 1 source, but I should take you at your word because you arrived at your answer through reasoning? 🤯 

Reasoning will tell you that they stay off the nations public grid because they avoid regulations such as winterizing their lines which cost money and doesn’t make any."
"I'm a big foodie, so there's that. I'm also into beer, so breweries. Baseball, football, soccer teams. Concerts, art shows, museums, the zoo. Galveston and the Hill Country are both pretty short drives. Family and friends. Idk, I feel like there is always something to do here."
Thank you. I will check it out. The climate there  sounds nice. I can't take the Houston summers anymore.
Lol
"Incidentally, there is a monopoly now. All the power comes from the same plants. It's an illusion of choice and why center point takes heavy blame right now."
"Okay. Whatever. Just as long as we don't join the South East grid. We would never, ever here the end of that once everyone realizes which states were a part of it."
Houston’s power doesn’t come from a singular source my friend.
Next you'll tell me your gas doesn't come from the same refinery.
Fuel comes from several refineries my friend.
