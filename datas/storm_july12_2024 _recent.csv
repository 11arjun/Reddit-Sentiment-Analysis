Can’t you dispute a misclassification? They have to prove you were not an employee and can get in a lot of trouble.
Lina Hidalgo mentioned a short term $750 assistance that you could apply for through the Greater Houston Disaster Alliance. There’s a link in [this](https://abc13.com/post/how-get-help-after-beryl-hurricane-recovery-fund/15061823/) article. Supposedly as fast as 48 hours.
You should apply for FEMA.GOV assistance right away. Do it online. They will help with the $750
"Then I’d look to see what side hustle you can get into. Do you have a vehicle? Door dash, Uber, etc for quick cash till things stabilize"
"Lots of food distribution sites available this week. Check websites at Houston Food Bank, Baker Ripley, local precincts, churches etc.
"
And I hate hate hate typing this but if you are in a bind financially it’s kind of a last resort option: consider plasma donation which can pay a few hundred dollars.
Good luck!
Look for clean up jobs!!!
"Find out where needs are and seek to fill them. Who knows, it might turn into self employment 🤷🏻‍♂️"
"Real talk? I’ve been without anything before and lived in a tent in a state park for a year with raccoons as neighbors. Take what work you can get and volunteer when you can’t. I got more help volunteering than anywhere and I didn’t feel like I was taking handouts. Don’t leave any gaps on your employment record and volunteerism looks great.
"
Call the Catholic Church nearest you and speak to their St Vincent de Paul society. You don’t have to be Catholic to get help from them. It might be worth an ask.
"How long had you worked there? If you were there in 2023, did you get a W-2 or 1099?"

Definitely put in an application for fema stat if you haven’t already. I just got approved today.
Not sure if it helps but Shell FCU is offering a disaster relief loan up to 15k. You’ll have to provide any photos and receipts of anything you may have had to spend money on.
"There’s a way to appeal for up to $42k if needed according to the letter I received.

"Apply for disaster relief. Make sure to note everything that you needed to pay for due to the hurricane. I was initially denied but as of yesterday was approved for $750.

You can still get unemployment they’re doing disaster benefits now
FEMA is hiring … get paid to help out!
I took out a loan from my bank to keep me from going under.
You are not alone.  Exact same scenario for my family
Tacos Dona Lena on Hammerly is hiring and in desperate need of staff. Can't guarantee how much you'll make but something is better than nothing.
"There is so much work out there right now with the storm. Yard cleanup, fence work, tree cutting, basic roof repairs, etc. If I wasn’t so busy with work I would start doing that on the side.  You gotta find ways to make that bread. It ain’t gonna come to you."
Disasterassistance.gov is a great resource. Texas has also opened Disaster Unemployment so you may qualify now. I would reach out to Texas workforce for more information.
Try SER jobs and see if they can help you with an employment opportunities. YMCA is also hiring at the moment
"I was misclassified and reported to the TWC and the IRS. Both found my claim to be true. However, I didn't get a dime from that employer. It did shift business practices in that niche industry (yoga studios). Good luck to you!"
"Just a silent observer here— but you all that take the time and effort to respond to someone in need like this is truly impressive. As a member of the houston community and fellow human, I praise you all for helping OP and anyone else who may benefit.  Kudos to you all "
"I'm willing to bet that ""incorrect classification"" was by intent."
You can also upload pics for inspectors for other claims damages like flooding lines in your home destroyed food or personal items like furniture etc.. it will help process other funding amounts faster.
Call 311
"I know this isn't of great help but fema is giving critical needs funding if you went without power had to use gas during outage of 750 instant approval .. just fill out application online they will direct deposit within 48 to 72 hrs.. make sure you check the box that says you need help with gas ,diapers critical needs box on application

Try this. Grants mostly for folks in your situation."
Honestly you should look into plassing. Helped me when i quit my fancy job.
"Apply for Amazon wearhouse, Krogers warehouse in person and HEB wearhouse. You will have a job by the end of next week more than likely."
"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALawyer/s/E6VBA49JSz 

You said here you were a contractor so I’m confused ?"
You didn’t notice you didn’t have payroll taxes taken out of your check?
i swear so many places do that independent contractor BS. had to put my foot down this year to get a proper W2
"wait. a contractor can't get unemployment checks? that doesn't sound correct. when i was laid off years ago as a contractor, i was able to get unemployment checks. has the law changed?"
I would suggest checking on your status by reviewing [TWC Independent Test](https://efte.twc.texas.gov/appx_e_twc_ic_test.html). File unemployment benefits if you’re not independent per TX laws.
"If you have a car payment, most will defer your monthly payment & just add another month to your term"
"I am struggling myself and I just made a Gofund me out of desperation. I made $1,000 in one day."
What line of work are you in?
Why can’t you collect unemployment as an independent contractor? 1099/gig workers were getting unemployment during the pandemic.
An employment attorney can file a lawsuit and would absolutely do it on contingency if you have a legit claim.
"Getting this fixed should be priority number one, have you filed a complaint with the labor board?

"Fema will give a quick 750. Apply online. If you need a computer go to a library or call.

St. Vincent de Paul society will provide some help as well. [https://www.archgh.org/resources/need-help/](https://www.archgh.org/resources/need-help/)

Fight the reclassification, make a complaint about it."

"FEMA disaster assistance, Harris County Assistance, TWC file on old employee, Snap, Apply for Texas lone star card, then go to any one open as there are signs for help on almost every business around houston just to start getting some income and move up from there.

">I lost my job right before the storm, and I haven’t been able to collect unemployment because my job misclassified me as an independent contractor rather than an employee.

"If you used to get SNAP benefits and have a card, you can get food lost benefits and may need to apply with a new application to get more food stamps on top of that it's called expedited stamps.

"I have much empathy and I am right there with you about a strain on finances !

Unemployment you need to do an appeal on that and let say you win they will back pay you from when you originally filed. Do you have your offer letter from when you were hired that is the first piece of strong evidence you are not a contractor.

Next FEMA is covering food loss their website is off and on and been crashing (many people applying in a major city) but I was approved for 750.00 so that will help you. I have not gotten the money in my bank yet but it is coming soon I am assuming they did not tell me a time frame but looking around online ppl say 7-10 business days"
I'll DM you about something that you can use to take the edge of while you're stressed.
I’m looking through the comments just like you. Thank you for posting this god bless you.
"It’s been a very stressing time… Got loan payments taken out of my bank account causing negative balance… yeah it’s hell. 

"
"Lost my Outside sales job in late June, and TWC never answer my calls or get back to me to get unemployment. 

"
"Same here brother. 

"
"Yes, you absolutely can."
Yes and they would be able to get back pay for the days from date of firing until now.
I'm just piggybacking on this for visibility. This exact thing happened to me last year. I applied for unemployment and one after an appeal. Also you file form SS8 with the IRS. It takes forever but they will force the employer to pay the taxes. You will have to wait until you get the 1099 tax form at the end of the year. You can't do it prior
can you apply to this along with FEMA or is it the same thing?
"The GHDA doesn't actually distribute any funds, it's just a website for donors to circle jerk on. Apply though fema and 211."
Printed money!!
Best option + food banks  Also a lot of credit cards are ok with you paying late this month due to beryl just call and they won’t charge you interest but you must call first
the site has been down since yesterday. you can get through part and then it gives a page that says “we’re sorry but the system can’t respond right now” and gives a phone number where the people tell you keep refreshing the website.
"$400-$500 a month. if you go twice a week and get the bonuses.... just depends on what donation center  is close to you. Just Google plasma donations see which locations are close to you,  download the app and it tells you everything you need to know and what to have before you go for your first time."
You can't donate if you potentially have an autoimmune disorder right?
"They usually pay on a prepaid card, and sometimes they don't pay immediately. I'm not sure why we still call it donating. It's basically last resort selling of your blood."
Can anyone donate if you aren’t on medications? I tried several years ago and didn’t weigh enough. I’m not on any heavy duty medications now but am underweight and am not the healthiest.
If you’re a health person it the easiest $400-500 you can make while helping others.
"I downvoted you because there’s nothing wrong with donating plasma. Shame on you for thinking there is. 

"
"They won't let me donate, I have very hard to hit veins, and the intake people take one look and say sorry can't do it."
What job is it
"Do you know which company? I applied through Walmart Distribution Center, Krogers, HEB, I have warehouse/logistics experience and was denied ('pursued with other candidates')."
Or Northwest Assistance Ministries in NW Houston. NAM.
When did you apply?
How? I was instantly denied.
I can't get any update or movement on my application.
I'm currently looking at all the jobs.
Softies downvoting you but this is by far the most obvious answer. OP should have nothing but time. Get after it and earn some money. It IS that simple sometimes.
"great resource! Offers so many different types of help, often within a few miles of you!"
That was a special case they normally dont
"Depending on the loans you can get deferred or forbearances .....student loans, car loans, and home loans offer this type of assistance for unemployment. Please sit down and call them all."
"Call TWC and ask them to investigate your status as an independent contractor.  If they decide you were misclassified, you could get unemployment as well as overtime premium for any time you worked over 40 hours in the last two to three years."
"This 100%. The SS8 is a slow, long process that will completely eff them over in some years. Chances are they will owe you money at the end of it, because a W2 employee has a portion of their taxes covered by their employer."
This is different funding.  This is non profit funding.  You can absolutely apply to both.
Same thing. The GHDA website is just a donor circle jerk.
"Okay, good to know! Thanks for that update. FEMA seems like the route to go."
Good reminder!!! I had forgotten that. You may have rental protections during a disaster declaration as well!!!
I take some serious drugs for my autoimmune everyday just to be able to function. I cannot donate any blood or plasma.
"If you are on medication then no. 


"
"I have one, and am not on meds. I made it half way through the first donation and fainted and then threw up when I came to. That half a donation caused a flare up, which lasted weeks, and every time I tried again during those weeks my iron was too low to be eligible- even with taking iron pills. I wouldn’t recommend it if you have any autoimmune issues. From what the doctor told me- the reaction I had is common in people with autoimmune disorders, which is why they typically don’t let you donate, even if you aren’t on medication."
Also some moms can’t donate because of weird antibodies you acquire during pregnancy
"It's definitely more like selling, yeah. But I know plenty of people who've done it not out of desperation but for extra money for fun shit. It's not like you're selling a kidney on the black market. And the folks who need that plasma appreciate the donation/sale either way."
You have to weigh at least 110 lbs. To donate plasma and blood.
"I’m not sure to be honest but…I’d say ethically I wouldn’t. Depending on your condition who knows if it’s something you can pass on. For example there is a strong correlation between RA and Epstein-Barr virus

"
Honestly I have no idea. I’m just speculating but I’d ask a doctor or nurse.
"I don’t know if that means the plasma could carry EBV 🤷🏽‍♀️ but I’ve read EBV burrows deep into the cells of patients and stays dormant. 

"
"[Several studies have shown that levels of EBV DNA and mRNA are much higher in the synovium of patients with RA than in that of healthy controls [83,89-91]. Synovial EB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1526553/)

"
I think I wasn't tall enough.
same. underweight and also there was something weird about me being born outside of USA before a certain year
"No shame but I hate that we have to resort to selling blood to survive.
Keyword being SURVIVE. 
it’s one thing when it’s voluntary but it’s another when it’s survival. 
Like giving blood. It’s a great thing but it hurts to think people have to do it."
Shame?  Rich people pay a premium to get their blood filtered on the regular.  It's a fucking steal to get PAID to do it lol.
The location is Bissonet street. Go figure.
"Think about it like this , every company have a warehouse some where , jus apply to everything"
"Are u passing the assessments afterwards ? U still have Cisco, usfoods , Gordon , frito lay, Coca Cola, budlight(I think), target( this is a hard company to get hired at tho but worth the try) Walgreens, cvs , etc, oreilly auto 


"
Apply at Diaken.
"Applied Saturday the 13th- first it said I was denied (I thought) but got a text tonight saying my case was updated and complete, logged in and it said I am approved for $750"
I gave up and let it be. But a couple days ago I received a text from fema telling me I was approved for $750.
"I was also instantly denied at first. I was told that since I have homeowners insurance I need to apply through them. So I applied through my homeowners insurance and was also denied and they told me to take the denial letter back to fema and appeal their denial. 

"
"I think it was officially listed as a disaster area, so it denied everyone.  I was just approved yesterday."
"Seriously. Loaded up my rake, chainsaw, pruning shears/cutters, twine, and yard trash bags and have been helping people in the area clean their yards up and get debris to the curb. I don't ask for anything in return but a lot of people want to pay me anyways for my efforts. I've made \~$3K in the past week."
"They are personal loans, but yes I’ll be calling to find out what they could do… thank you for your caring comment."
"I don't work for the TWC, but I have a pretty decent understanding of the rules the designate a person as am employee VS. a contractor.  If you want to DM me and give me a basic idea of what you did, I am happy to let you know if I think you were truly misclassified."
"HOWEVER, this is for the Dercho and May Floods.  The GHDA will be setting up a program for Hurricane Beryl as well, but it takes time.

"In order to apply for assistance, you will have to call and make an appointment with one of the agencies.

I can't win with this life
Sorry your struggling. I feel you I have been layed off for a few months.
"I didn't know we can't donate. Are the drugs you speak of classes as biologics? I will have to check with my Rhume.

"
I did the ANA test which showed a positive result. The advice was to go to a specialist to figure it out :l I can't go to one because I don't have insurance.
I've never weighed enough except when pregnant.
Ok thank you for the info!
"when you donate plasma, technically they give you back your blood, only stealing your nutrients from the blood 🫢"
Well when you say it like that yeah it does kinda sound bad.. *selling blood*
"I pass the assessments, I only hear back from one company (Frito Lay; I did an interview but wasn't chosen), I've tried Coca Cola, Budlight (Anhuser Busch), Target all not chosen. I'll look at other companies in the meantime."
"My portal says Eligible for the 750, is that the same as approved?"
Thank you Biologics and DMARDs
"You can sometimes have a positive ANA and not actually have something. But you def should be seen so you can get ahead of it, if you do in fact have something. However, I understand the insurance all too well. I was laid off a few months ago, thus me trying so hard to donate. Kind of an impossible situation, I know 💔 I can’t afford to go to the rheumatologist right now either. Take care of yourself as best as you can."
"Not sure why you’re getting downvoted but yeah, I’m very petite, just under 5’ and I’m at a healthy weight, but still under 110. I wish I could give plasma."
Yes
Yupp
I think it is something because I got shingles a couple of months ago. I hope to sign up for ACA when enrollment starts
"😭 I’m sorry to hear that. Hopefully you can get ahead of it and minimize the daily impacts! My flare ups are frequent caused by stress- be it mental or physical. Honestly, mediation has helped me manage my daily symptoms tremendously. It’s just a bandaid until I can start medication, but it’s helped. That, light exercise, and cleaning up my diet have made  big difference."
