"I last night created a Google spreadsheet on this very topic for my wife and I that goes over the top 50 US Metro areas by population.  It includes all the population fields from the Wikipedia page on the topic, and I added CoL and expected temperatures. I can share if you would like.  I've not filtered out but did flag cities in Texas, Florida, etc.  (Edit 3: I removed the flag as it seemed to be confusing people and is really my bias.)

Edit: let's try a public link share

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yr4sIjde-ZflSpU-_obfGJo2sazsj6AHcADskTH-tOU/edit?usp=drivesdk

Second Edit:  People can always add additional columns.  Maybe you want to know how many Chinese grocery stores are in the area, or presence of art communities, or distance to the nearest national Park (I see you cheating, St. Louis).  Copy and modify at your leisure!"
Is everyone finding jobs before you move? Or are you just moving and hoping it all works out? I don’t hate the idea of leaving but not sure how it would work financially. Also so much family is here.
Everyone is moving to Denver
I'm leaving from TX to mass. Next week
"I don't get why people are always so hostile towards people wanting to leave Houston. It's not a personal insult. This city can be an acquired taste and I say that as someone who was born and raised here, and has lived other places. Nobody's forcing YOU to move, people are just making their own personal choices and asking for input. The least you could do is be neighborly and kind. If you love it here, nobody's telling you to get out. Some people just don't love it and shockingly, that's ok and valid with everything going on. 

OP, I hope wherever you end up you're happy, because it doesn't seem like you are here and I completely understand that. More power to you, I hope you find a good fit somewhere."
"Ah the Texas poverty trap, so cheap to live that you can't afford to move. I think the only way out is to get a job somewhere else that can cover the inevitably increased expenses."
I relocated to Providence RI for a job post pandemic and I love it up here.
"Give the DMV (DC, Maryland, Virginia) area a go.  It's beautiful 2 seasons out of 4, and not bad during the other 2, lots of great culture/history stuff, outdoors activities, great food (similar in terms of diversity of choices as well) pretty vibrant community of younger professionals but also good for family life, older folks, etc..  I don't know a ton about the cost of living nowadays but I'm thinking its a lot cheaper than NY/SF/Boston and sort of comparable to Houston.  10 years ago it was only a little more expensive to live in Northern Virginia than Houston.  The one catch is it is a patchwork of suburbs unless you want to be somewhere in DC itself.  So there's highway driving.  But that's the same here... at least there the highways are in better shape and you see nicer stuff as you're driving.

As far as disasters, yes, they do have them, but they've done more to weatherize the grid than Houston has."
"Lived most my life in Houston, but I'm done.  Heat, humidity, storms, traffic...all getting unbearable. We are considering Asheville (pop 100K) or Charlotte (pop 1M).  A bit smaller but just seems easier."
"Minnesota. Cost of living isn't crazy. Pretty well insulated from climate change, and winters are getting less intense. Politics aren't insane. We are actively planning a move."
A Chicago suburb. It’s actually not as unaffordable as you’d think and it has that Houston level of diversity and good food. And a lot of people always point to crime in Chicago 1. It’s the same as crime in Houston literally. 2. Once you’re a local you know where to go and where not to go just like in Houston you know not to go to greenspoint at night. I’m thinking of moving there or Long Beach CA but the possibility of owning a home in California is much lower than Illinois
"Moved to SoCal near the coast. I'm not going to lie, breaking out of Houston and trying to purchase a house here will cost you everything. Not only did we sell our house in Houston but had to sell everything in it too. You get what you pay for however."
"Michigan. Detroit has a reputation but nowadays it is honestly a pretty great city that isn't super expensive, especially depending on area. Summers are obviously nothing compared to Houston, politics are generally pretty sane, cheapest weed in the country, no huge natural disasters except snow and ice storms but the recovery from those pales in comparison to what you guys are going through. Genuinely feel the state as a whole is very overlooked"
I moved to Wisconsin a year ago and couldn't be happier.
"I was talking to a friend last night who is also working on moving from Houston.  One of her options was Charlotte, which I think is a good one.  My sister lives there and it's a great place to live."
"Look at places like New Mexico, Illinois (not necessarily Chicago), Pennsylvania, or the area between NY and Maine. It's not always going to be the places you first think of, but if you really do a deep dive, you'll find the kind of place.youre looking for."
[deleted]
"Oaxaca, Mexico.  18th months till I retire and we've found our next home.  adios amigos."
"I live in San Francisco and I hate it. The passive aggressive culture in San Francisco gets way worse the more north you go. Seattle just feels so depressing tbh 

I always recommend OC or San Diego because of the sun, and I love Boston as well. Not any less cheap, but I feel like my tax dollars go further there than in Texas, but YMMV"
"I just moved to Bellingham Washington. Guys, it's basically Narnia. It's beautiful, walkable, and the high today is going to be °78. I couldn't take another summer in Houston"
"We looked at Olympia as a city.  It’s much cheaper than Seattle but close enough to enjoy the city.  

Not all parts of Colorado are expensive.  Visit a few places and you’ll see.

Also, try Connecticut or Raleigh.  The East coast is a different lifestyle, though.  Less land, more townhomes."
Planning on Detroit suburbs. It's insane people are sleeping on this area.
"Columbus OH. Big city, small town feel. 2 hours from Lake Erie. 2 hours to mountains in West Virginia. Good cost of living. Diverse economy. Diverse population. Lots of jobs. Excellent college in Ohio State University. Far enough from Houston to really experience a different part of USA."
"I have friends moving to Colorado this year but they are remote so they don't have to worry about living in the big cities.

I've considered the PNW area since it's beautiful and there are lots of natural areas but my coworkers who live there tell me they get seasonal depression every winter because the sun sets so early. The Midwest around Chicago has always seemed too cold for me in winter but I'm not entirely ruling it out now.

I've thought about New Mexico around the Santa Fe area and plan to take some road trips to that area later this year to check it out."
"Atlanta, Nashville, Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, Athens GA, Asheville NC, Sacramento, Boulder, Denver."

"We're aiming to be out of Texas by 2026 and we've narrowed it down to either Denver, Colorado or Richmond, Virginia.

My wife and I both have a huge love for the great outdoors, so obviously Denver is incredibly appealing in that aspect. If you live anywhere west of 25, you're a maximum of 15-20 minutes from a huge number of beautiful hiking trails. Biggest drawback is that cost of living in Denver is high (mostly housing costs, almost everything else seems to cost close to the same as Houston) and a lot of people are moving there (though many are also leaving).

But we also really loved the culture and vibe of Richmond when we visited. It reminded me of if you took Montrose and turned it into an entire city instead of just a neighborhood. Richmond is about 1.5 hours from the Appalachians and about 2 hours from the Atlantic. So you've got relatively easy access to mountains or beaches. Cost of living is slightly higher than Houston, though not by too much. But there is also the risk of hurricanes there, albeit not as bad as Houston. For now, anyway.

It's a hard choice to make, but we know we'd be happy in either place."
Illinois good public services and blue state
"If you have a uterus, go somewhere that will actually care for you."
I want to go to Minnesota (Twin cities) or Upstate New York (Syracuse) my wife loves outdoor ice skating. I WFH so it's possible. But I need to wait until my 1 year old gets into public school. We can't afford daycare And are relying on retired grandmothers for help at the moment.
"I moved to Humboldt County CA. Redwoods, ocean, and temperate climate.  I have worn sleeves all week. Had to turn on the heater 3 days ago because it got so cold overnight and we had left windows open, it was 60 in the house.  It's in the middle of nowhere, though. 


Not easily accessed for travel and limited purchasing options. Forget same-day Amazon delivery...."
Spouse wants to go to Pittsburg.  I want an interdimensional portal to a functional Houston and Texas.
Kansas City! Deeply underrated city that's growing like crazy right now
"I've never even considered it before this week, but I'm starting to think about what that could look like. A few years ago a friend of mine moved to Minneapolis, and I realized it's kind of this bizarro version of Houston: often dismissed for bad weather, punches above its weight economically and culturally, is growing but still affordable. One of my favorite things about Houston is how its bad reputation filters out a lot of people who just want to live somewhere cool, and I imagine Minnesota has a similar filter. Plus their state and local politics seem to have a very ""pragmatic progressive"" vibe, which I dig."
"Move to Virginia outside of the DC area. We were in Richmond Virginia and absolutely loved it. Food scene is surprisingly good, the cost of living isnt insane, theres a decent sized airport, Shenandoah natl. park is 2 hrs away, the beach is 2 hrs away. You get all 4 seasons, no threat of major natural disasters, diverse enough to where you can find a few people of your tribe. Theres kayaking and white water rafting in the city itself. Big hospital system in the city, employment is decent for a city its size.

Honestly its a hidden gem."
Considering PNW or New England.
"Portland Oregon is where I moved from Houston in 2019 and I have never regretted it for a second (well... except for the heat dome). Depending on if you're renting or not, I've found the price to be essetially the same if you're willing to live with roommates"
New Mexico
"As someone who has lived in Denver / Boulder for the better half of the last 12 years with a few years in Austin/ SF as well (( I’m originally from greater HTX))….Denver is the most expensive, I would say it’s neck and neck with SF on most things but the pay is significantly less. Not sure what your job is, but as someone who works in healthcare- SF nurses typically make / start at 2-3 x as much as CO nurses & this significant pay difference seems to affect the majority of professions amongst the 2 cities. Cost of living in Denver is high, you’ll need a ‘newer’ car for the snow/ winters (which can be brutal and expensive). Rent is high in Denver, prices of homes are outrageous, food/ grocery/ tax is high here (so if you need a new car, don’t get one here!) if you can afford it, it’s an okay city. It lacks diversity, good food, a downtown, high paying jobs, natural beautiful scenery within the actual city (you can drive an hour + (without traffic)  to some mountains, but you are not close) Also, if you are coming from Texas- you will see people are not ‘community’ focused neighbors here…people are very independent of one another (like SF) which is fine, but it will be a culture shock coming from Texas. This is just my opinion! You may love it. These are just things to keep in mind. Best of luck to you and your move. Choose somewhere that meets your needs!"
OUT OF THE USA!
"I moved to Houston to gtfo of Ohio…. and after all the flooding events and then Harvey and then the pandemic and then the freeze and then being in TWO cones of uncertainty at once  in 2020 with a newborn… I finally lost it and moved back to Ohio. But a much better part of Ohio than where I came from. 

If you’re in tech or healthcare, Columbus is not a bad area to be, but man is housing insane here right now. But the winters are mild and we don’t have hurricanes either."
[deleted]
I’m moving back to the beach in New Haven CT as soon as our house sells…. I tried here for 3 years. I’m done.
Pittsburgh
I’ve heard the schools in Colorado have libraries.
"Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Milwaukee? :/"
"Las Vegas suburbs, like Henderson or Summerlin they have some really nice suburbs and while the cost of living is higher than here, it’s not as bad as the West coast."
"I have family in Pittsburgh and Reno. Neither seemed like viable places, but honestly now both of them do. 

I have cousins in Knoxville, but you’d be stuck with a similarly shitty political landscape. 

Gonna follow this thread for ideas."
Omaha
Find a good job. Move there. Live simply. Save a ton of money in your emergency fund so you have a lot more flexibility in the future.
Pittsburgh. Relatively affordable and in a more purple state. Near the mountains and the east coast.
"Moved a few years ago exactly for the reasons you stated to the Pacific Northwest, specifically tacoma, 45 min outside of  Seattle . Sure the housing is a lot more expensive but more affordable than seattle. The  weather, economy and healthcare is much better. I do miss sometimes the heat and food from Houston but every time I go back to visit, i get a reminder why I left. There are things here that I don’t like as well but the positives outweigh the negatives ( housing cost, food options, rainy season)."
"Colorado is the fackin best. There’s a reason so many Texans are out there.

I moved from Denver to Austin recently. Just moved back to Denver and this weekend alone made me realize where I need to be"
Go where you can get a job.
"Pittsburgh! Everyone thinks it’s crazy but I’m in mixed marriage (B/W) and it’s better than many places for diversity, lots of rich folks left amazing museums, parks, universities, cost is not too high, climate disaster protected by Appalachias, overall cool rejuvenation feeling ( reviving  industrial city). 
Just dint know if it’s mainly blue or red. Then the episode last weekend so….. not sure. But I’d check it out."
"This is going to sound crazy but have you thought of the Kansas City area, it’s really boring but it does offer a calm affordable lifestyle."
We moved back to Michigan 🤷
"South Delaware isn't so bad.

We happen to have shared ownership of a property there and it seems the most reasonable location if such a move need be made."
"Colorado here. People have been moving here en masse since weed was legalized, and it got worse after everyone started working from home and no longer have an office cubicle post-covid. It's not just Denver, folks are targeting the smaller cities, and in 2023 the fastest growing city in CO per capita was Fort Collins. Demand has slowed slightly in the past year, but not by much. So many people have moved to CO from TX that it has become its own meme, and generally, people from TX are welcome now like a tourist from Dallas who went to Galveston days after Beryl hit and complained that everything was closed. Big pavement princess trucks that parked like a jerk? Bet it has TX plates (and odds are it will). A single-car wreck like driving down a two-story concrete staircase? TX plates? Probably. That's the expectation, anyway. Competition for real estate is tough, but not impossible, and the prices have done nothing but go up.

The roads and streets are also in horrible condition. CO is one of the most tax-rich states in the country, it has weed tax, tourism tax (general tourists, skiing, hunting, hiking, kayaking, rock climbing, etc), a decades-long yearly influx of new tax payers, the lottery (no idea if any of that money goes to the roads) and yet the streets and interstates totally suck.

You could probably find similar cities like Ashville, NC, or Eugene, OR, that don't have quite the same level of competition for real estate and much better roads."
"Yep. Emigrating to Canada at the end of the year. Started the process in 2016, finally approved earlier this year (covid mucked up the process). Def not cheap tho."
Colorado is affordable for upper middle class.
Looking at Greensboro or Winston-Salem NC and at Pittsburgh.
"I don’t know what the prevalent opinion on Philly is (I’m sure not great) but I visited early summer and I fell in LOVE. I was in University City but man just how easy it was to get around was amazing. First time I ever used public transportation which included the bus, tram, and subway. Buddy was like “hey man let’s go some Ethiopian” and 7-9 min walk later we’re there. Quick 15 min bus ride and I’m at love park. 20 min tram ride and we’re at a jazz show.

Also the few people I interacted with were so lovely. We went to my buddy’s house in south Philly (doesn’t live there yet) and his neighbor came and a greeted us both times. Welcomed us to the neighborhood.

Got me really thinking. Man my dog and I could be happy here. I gave myself a goal to spend at least a year there. Hopefully in a year or two."
"PNW all day. 

Denver is too crowded and getting worse by the day."
I was looking at Nova Scotia. Had previously considered Costa Rica.
"Try Rhode Island -it's like Massachusetts lite. Great public education, lots of beaches, mix of political beliefs, and lots of areas where the typical American Dream is still within reach (at least for now). Providence is a small city but we aren't too far from Boston for a night out. There are also tons of little beach towns that are great to enjoy with family."
"My husband and I are laying the groundwork to be in California by this time next year. Yes it will be expensive, but it’s better weather, better quality of life and far more politically compatible with our beliefs than Texas. I’ve lived in the Houston/Galveston area for 39 years, and I’m just done."
I left Texas for Colorado this time last year. Best decision I ever made.
"I have family in Fayetteville, Arkansas and every time I go up to visit I always think to myself damn I could totally live here. Beautiful scenery, there's plenty of stuff to do, and Branson, Missouri is less than 2 hours away. Only thing I could see being an issue is possibly the job market I'm not sure how it is up there but my uncle makes 6 figures and they live in a huge brand-new house that would probably cost a fortune down here."
Thinking about moving to the heights.
The downsides of living in a LCOL area with a healthy job market…
it seems so difficult to move out of Texas on a low income since basically every other state worth moving to is much more expensive
Michigan beckons.  Endless fresh water.
"My wife and I moved to Southern Colorado a few years back and haven't looked back since. We found out later that Texans are moving here in mass apparently (whatever). I will say that it is a bit more expensive than houston, but not much. I would only suggest having a job lined up before you move if you're not remote."
"Check out the Tri cities area in Washington state.

It’s in the eastern part of the state situated along the Yakima, Snake, and Columbia rivers.

You’re a few hours from Seattle and Portland and 300 sunshine days a year. You’ll get hot temps but without the humidity as the area is in the rain shadow of the cascades.

Outside of the US, check out southern Spain. Cost of living is cheap. You can live a rich fulfilling life on $35k/year with walkable cities and a warm culture."
"I’m looking at Philadelphia, Washington state and Colorado. I honestly don’t care much outside of it has to be a blue state."
"Charlotte , NC"
Minnesota
Look into the Twin Cities.
"Battle Creek, Michigan I heard is the place to go."
west coasy
"Consider North Carolina.  I lived in Dallas for 35 years and was so proud to live in such a vibrant city.  But after moving to near Asheville, I discovered a really nice climate and culture.  I don't think I'd ever move back."
I moved to Phoenix. If you can get through the summers it’s great.
"Grew up in the Houston area but will likely move in 1-1.5 years. Wife and I are looking at NoVa, northwest of IAD airport towards West Virginia. Thought about Colorado (like everyone else from Texas)."
"I have family in KC (some on both MO and KS side) and I always enjoy it when I visit and they are happy there!

I also have a cousin in Indianapolis that loves it.

I chose the PNW when leaving Houston last year after realizing I was not happy in TX anymore for several reasons."
Virginia
"North or South Carolina but they are still prone to hurricanes but you won’t be without power for a week when one hits. Northern California, Orange County. PNW  has many great cities and stuff for everyone to do. Maine, upstate New York, Boston is pretty nice. All depends on what you like and want to do. Colorado is nice but I think there are many better options out there. And honestly the food is not all that here, cities in all these other named states have good food and their own type of food. I work in travel hospitality and have loved many of the cities I have traveled to."
Any recommendations for a hippie town?
Thank you for this post! I thought about Chicago or Los Angeles
I moved to Denver from Houston a little over 2 years ago and don’t regret it. I feel like cost of living is fairly comparable and there are so many rental units coming online here that the rents should go down. We also have a reliable power grid and quick access to the mountains.
"Go to the Great Lakes area. Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo, Toronto, etc.

Probably insulated from most insane weather, plenty of economic activity. Plentiful water, even as time goes on."
I moved to Chicago and I fucking love it.
"Charlotte, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, also around Denver. You have tons of options. With insurance and property taxes, Houston gets kind of pricey. Wasn’t worth it to me. No offense to those that like it."
I'm thinking Colorado
Colorado Springs. Such an amazing little city with fantastic weather and close proximity to Denver. I would be there so fast if my current work was there too.
Chicago is really nice. If you can find a nice job there they have public transport. Roads are nice. And there are so many opportunities and businesses there
Denver for me
Anywhere that you can go to the mailbox and not come back wet would be nice.
"Red states are cheaper for a reason, thats how it is. You get what you pay for"
I’m staying.
I leave Friday.  Arizona.
Adios
"I'm looking into the deserts maybe New Mexico. I know I can handle heat and if you get rid of the humidity and cool it off when I am sleeping sounds fucking perfect. Not a lot of rain to fuck up my detail jobs on my truck, I can have rocks and cacti as my lawn and never mow.

Oh and I can finally have my grow shed!!!!

I am ready to buy a piece of desert, put a trailer on it and live like Budd in Kill Bill."
"Idk I lived in austin and San Diego before houston and I’m the happiest I’ve ever been

San Diego is my favorite city and I’ll move back, but San Diego has a terrible job market. It wasn’t worth it to be broke out there for me

Austin was fun, but it’s pretty granola and over priced and over crowded. Also I love to surf so spending 5 years in austin I felt like a fish out of water

Overall I love houston. It’s cheap, the jobs here are good and pay well, I can still surf occasionally in Galveston, we have a great music scene, but I guarantee you that you won’t find more down to earth people in any large city like you will in Houston"
"All the civilized places in the US are expensive to match. Truthfully, sensible people should stop fleeing dysfunctional cities and put in some effort into fixing things up but I understand it's not that easy. 

I'm personally looking at just leaving the US eventually. A lot of us will have to in order to retire anyway."
We are going to live in poverty near San francisco
"I know that the state’s political apparatus doesn’t exactly align, but Tulsa has affordable housing and a funky art scene. They also have medical marijuana if that’s a plus. Cards are easy to acquire and they have seasons up there. They can also handle icy conditions."
Let’s all move to Vegas
Somewhere in the Northeast is the plan for the moment.
Chattanooga
All those cities in the northeast and midwest that everyone has been leaving for decades?
"Try Anchorage, AK. Mid-sized city. Good food. Medium cost of living. It's sort of purple state. The conservatives are more of the libertarian or corporate whore variety than culture war jesus freak variety. Lots and lots of outdoor stuff to do if you're into it. Definitely doesn't have hot weather. Traffic is no where near as bad as Houston either."
"We moved to H-town for my happiness almost 7 years ago (3 days before Harvey!), bought a house 5 years ago to live in until the unborn kid got out of college, and we are going the fuck back to NJ next summer after the kid finishes their kindergarten Montessori loop. I’m so sad to leave the weather, food (best vegan scene!!), breweries and cost of living, but it’s just not worth it. 

If my wife wasn’t from NJ and her family was still up there, we’d probably go get a beach shack in Cali. At this point, I am happy to pay taxes for infrastructure and rights."
Vegas probably
Never thought Texas was bad until I started to break my alt-right conditioning a few years ago... But I'm unfortunately too stupid to go anywhere else but a trade. (No Uni degree)
Portland oregon seems to have their shit together and they care about quality of life.
"I’m just dropping this suggestion into every convo in which it is relevant:

If you are a blue voter considering moving out of a red state, don’t move to a blue state; move to a swing state. You will be instantly much more powerful in at least a few ways."
I've looked at central Washington and it looked good.  My wife and I are looking at Mexico and South Africa amongst other places.
"I'm looking at Omaha, personally. 
I really like the music community there."
"I'm originally from central Texas; have lived in Chicago, Boston, and now Madison. I'm becoming fond of the upper midwest in particular. Might consider Minneapolis next time I'm doing a job hunt."
San Antonio is nice!
I’m actually considering Dallas as a potential destination or possibly moving out of state either Florida or South Carolina
Good luck
Following this because we want to move too… it’s just difficult with a big family.
Cleveland welcomes you!
Minnesota or Iowa
"I'm entertaining a job offer in South Carolina right now, apparently it's lovely."
"I'm moving to Austin.

Minnesota. 

Moving for love and seasons, but will likely pick a more populous city in MN once I'm there for a bit and can see more of the state."
maine looks pretty good. its so cheap that you can get a winter home down south somewhere.
Best friends stepbrother is probably moving to Colorado. It's nice if you can float/afford it.
"PNW is the best. The real estate is hella high, gas is high. But compared to Houston, the real estate tax is a lot less. Same with insurance.
No sales tax on food (non precooked).
And the surrounding scenery is absolutely unbeatable on this country. For non taxed sales, head to Portland once a year to do your big shopping."
Looked at the prices of homes outside of Texas and thought better of it lol. NC is the closest I've seen other than Florida. I'm still leaning towards staying. Btw it's funny how this is becoming a popular sentiment now but I've had this sentiment for a while now and now I'm just considering staying while everyone else is considering now leaving.
"Currently live in Austin—going to Chicago this week until mid-October. Inexpensive COL, greats summers and 3rd largest US city. Can’t stand a winter there though. Next year I’m considering Portland or Seattle as my move out of Texas."
Decided to leave without a plan lol
"I would leave so fast if my family would go for it. My husband and son are die hard Texans. Also, my son/dil have my granddaughter and I would never leave her."
"Philadelphia and it's suburbs. You will find a very good food scene, and the CoL is pretty close to Houston. Philly is a big city, and had crime problems,  but there's a lot of nice areas. Beautiful rolling land. NYC is 90 minutes away, the Jersey shore is day-tripable, and you have the Poconos for hiking. Four seasons. Winter lasts until March though."
"I will always love Texas as its home, especially the Htown area but Reno NV has been a strange calm haven. It’s like Austin used to be before half of CA moved here. Funny enough people complain about CA people moving here."
"Pittsburgh is the best! If you’re blue, come on through! 😉"
"Charlotte, NC"
I’ve got my eye on New Mexico
"Personal Recs from about 20 years of living/moving- Chicago (hometown), Durham, NC- Sacramento,CA- Casper, WY- Gilbert or Scottsdale, AZ"
"If you don't mind severe cold, the midwest might tick your boxes. We're shopping for a place where NONE of the seasons are trying to kill us, though."
"OP, if you figure out let me know, I want to get my family the hell out of here too."
"I lived in Vermont for a little bit, in Burlington. It was nice and the people were pretty cool. Very cold and lots of snow tho. And I think you have to get a dog and a Subaru…"
"Bellingham, WA"
I moved to New Mexico
"My sister moved to Connecticut.  Eastern Connecticut (the part not part of the NYC metro areas) has a number of small cities where the CoL is just marginally higher than Houston.  Same goes for much of non-NYC, non-Boston New England.  State-level politics are blue, local politics are usually mixed, winters have gotten significantly warmer, overall climate is chilly, and the food sucks unless you like lobster."
"I'm currently looking into Colorado and Montana. I've lived in CO before and loved it. I work from home, so I can pretty much go anywhere that I can afford. Also avoiding cities. I'm trying to find something much more rural. I plan on leaving this fall."
"I teach and my husband’s job has offices all over the US so we have discussed moving too. We’re torn between Denver, Portland, and Chicago. Personally I’d rather live in Portland, but we have a lot of friends who work remote that are going to Colorado. 

It just gets hard when we own a home, have lots of family here, want to start a family, etc. I feel like if we wait much longer it’ll be too difficult to move."
"I can not tolerate it here any longer. We were spared the hurricane as we are in central Texas, but I'm slowly losing myself here. It's hot, ugly, dangerous, crap politics and the cheapness in which my house was built shows. I'm hoping to move to the PNW. it's expensive, but honestly, I don't want to waste my life being here.  I feel your pain."
"Flee to the Cle. 

Seriously it’s awesome and cheap."
If you can deal with equally miserable but different summers I would suggest Arizona. On the positive side the winters are perfect and there’s no natural disasters or artic blasts. The cost of living is comparable to Houston overall and there’s no humidity and SoCal is only about a 5.5 hour drive away.
"Im a born and raised Texan and I always really enjoyed the northern midwest. Chicago, Madison, Milwaukee… It’s so cozy and the fall seasons are truly to die for. Snow is brutal but it’s still beautiful. Would not recommend central midwest under any circumstances though, it’s worse than Tx. Michigan and Vermont are beautiful as well."
The Great Lakes Region is really the only region of the soon to be fascists states of America.  If you think loosing power is bad?  Think running out of water.
I wish you luck.
"Anybody thought about Pittsburgh? Low cost of living, very green and with some actual elevation. kind of a hidden gem in my opinion"
"I was thinking upstate New York. Syracuse or Rochester, maybe."
Upstate NY or Buffalo
"Come to Maryland! We have women's rights, unionized municipal employees (including teachers), incredible healthcare, and almost no severe weather. You can visit NYC, DC, the ocean, or the Appalachian mountains all within less than half days drive. 

Suburbs around DC are stupid expensive but everywhere else is just regular expensive."
"Moved to NYC a year ago, went back to Houston in July, regretted it and came back. The recent hurricane just made me remember why I left in the first place."
Dallas is great
I've been looking at New Mexico and Denver
"I wish there is a city that build like Tokyo, also cheap food prices"
MICHIGAN!
I’m actually jealous of your honesty and bravery
"Check out Omaha, NE. It’s 8hr drive to Denver, Chicago, Minneapolis along with other places. It’s no Houston but there’s a lot to do there."
Buffalo NY has a similar cost of living.
"Your challenge is finding a ""blue"" state that isn't expensive.  Sounds like your choices are Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Detroit or Pittsburgh, though i would consider Wisconsin and Pennsylvania ""purple""."
"It evens out if you think about it.  No money spent on dealing with weeks without power, a lot of more free stuff to do, less money spent on gas, food seems to be cheaper or relatively the same anywhere in the US, less insurance, less stress induced damage, and etc.  Use your head and quit letting the “NO STATE INCOME RAX” rule your brain."
Move to Los Angeles 😂😂
Phoenix? Dry heat but no flooding or hurricanes
"I mean if youre asking if it was me, I'd move to Atlanta, but I like the heat.

Youre relatively safe from natural disasters, still in a good sized city, somewhat diverse (nothing is like Htown for that) choice of suburb/urban/semirural options, and the politics are a little better if still challenging.

Just for whatever its worth."
"I might just go back to Illinois. If I can find a job in my field, I would. Maybe not Chicago, though. I know it would be better in terms of infrastructure, but it's still a big city. I need a break from city life in general."
Honestly thinking about moving to Chicago to still have diversity and good food scene and have a home state with saner politics.
"A lot of folk will comment on the higher cost of living and that's fair but also what's the point of living in a low cost of living place where the city infrastructure is failing, the natural disasters and weather are getting progressively worse (not that anywhere is fully immune to that), the built environment is toxic, and the state government is slowly taking over the city?"
"Bruhh Denver is insane homelessness, everything is expensive as hell lol … let me know if you find a alternative"
I was looking at Naperville outside Chi… then they got a derecho last night 😂🥴
Wife and I are planning our exidous in the next few years down to Guadalajara. Either Zappopan or find something in the Chapala/Ajijic area. We absolutely love it down there and have family in the area so it's basically home already
Looks like a bunch of people are leaving. Good!  Maybe housing prices will settle down a bit in Houston. Leave us to our trash.
Tennessee is BEAUTIFUL.  Lakes and rivers and creeks everywhere.
The cost of living is going to get you. The ones that are similar in price also deal with their own type of weather. Don't forget you aren't just dealing with higher cost of living but also state income tax. I tried to move back to the North East (grew up in TX was in NYC for 13 years then back to TX) and the salaries were about the same as I have in Houston and you then have to pay income tax. Then the houses cost double what they do here. Gas was almost a dollar more a gallon. We just decided to stay in TX and make the best of it.
"I'm currently living in NY for work, wife is back home in Spring with our dogs and home we bought in 2021. Looking to relocate to Colorado Springs soon. The wife was not happy with the prospect of living in NY, but COS sounds very lucrative for us."
I’m considering Colorado
We are moving to Albany next summer
i swear everybody from tx moving to colorado
Chicago or Minneapolis would be my choice. I like the cold and WFH so ….
"Honestly guys another comment said it but with the Texas poverty trap your buying power WILL go down. No matter where you go, unless you make over 200K.. (but then at point you can buy solar panels for your house lol and vacation when disasters strike)"
Chicago.
"Coming from Houston, Colorado’s lack of diversity is going to be shocking. You’ll also miss good food. I would definitely pick a place where you can find both of those bc I think you’ll miss them"
"You don’t sound like you’re from here, since you don’t even know “whatever Texas is good at”.  Are there no conversations to be had?  Do we have to make up fake stuff to get the ball rolling?"
Bye bye.
r/SameGrassButGreener
If you’re having a bad time in Houston you’re gonna have a bad time in any other medium to large sized city
Bye. Where are you going to go? East coast?  Hurricanes. Up north?  Cold winters and potential blizzards. Mid-West?  Tornadoes. Cali?  Good luck and you may fall into the ocean one day. AZ? Desert and oppressive heat. So where do you want to go?
"Were you not aware of the heat, hurricanes, or politics before you moved?"
"Raton, NM looked really nice but I was just driving through."

[deleted]
How does Montana look?
Just move to Charleston or Savannah
Chattanooga!!!
So many houses gonna be for sale in Houston that it will be so affordable that people will second guess their decision...🤣
I’ve always been interested in the SE coast
Idaho or Utah are good examples. Colorado is still okay. WA or OR is same as California.
Kansas City?
Check out Georgia or the Carolinas either.
Is Minnesota any better? I hear good things about Minneapolis 👀
I’m sooooo sick of the heat!! Husband wants to stay but if up to me we’re out a here!
Family is considering Connecticut and will be traveling to see homes.
We are thinking New Mexico.
That’s the dilemma and why we are all still here!!! 😫
"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania?"
"I’m trying to get my fiancé on board with Louisville. Considered a red state but currently has a Democratic Governor. Medium sized, four hour drive from a bunch of other places, four seasons. After growing up in Houston, living in San Francisco for a decade, and now being back in Houston for a few years, I’m just looking for something reasonable across the board. I’m too old for all this nonsense."
Charolette would be my pick.
"It’s a little hot right now, but Maryland is wonderful and the heat won’t last too much longer!"
The Philly suburbs are great.
I am moving to Pennsylvania .
I have family in Boston. I’m going to Boston.
"I'm ready to go I had to move to league city for a while, cuz the prices were just getting two out of control in Houston"
i would if i could afford to
"We left for Buffalo several years ago, and have had no regrets. Other Texas family members with kids followed a year later, and just in the last few months friends of ours from Houston purchased a home here for use in the summers. Snow and cold weather may scare some people away, but at least here the winters are not brutal cold like the midwest, and the city knows how to deal with winter extremes. Summers are a blast as the city comes alive with people out and about, 90s are rare, and never a 100 degree day in history (so far, fingers crossed). Buffalo is a small big city, over 1M+ people plus proximity to larger cities like Toronto, along with climate and terrain not to be found anywhere in Texas. If you love old and often historic housing types like in the Heights, Buffalo has thousands of well-maintained homes in walkable neighborhoods all over the city (and some suburbs) for lower prices, lower out-of-pocket taxes, and way lower insurance costs than in Houston. Especially for people who can work remotely, and want to live in an affordable and walkable old neighborhood, Buffalo is a great bargain and location. As a smaller city, the employment and pay situation is dependent on your job and experience, but low-wage jobs have a higher starting point in NY than in Texas. 

For those concerned about snow/sun/clouds/rain, Buffalo climate is similar to the PNW but cooler with snow in the winters (with intermittent periods of warmth and dryness), and without the occasional summer extremes (no 100s). There is plentiful water-based activities in the warm months (beaches, lakes, fishing, boating, etc), and snow-based activities in the winters (local skiing, sledding, skating, etc)."
Maryland
"I moved to Oregon, Willamette Valley, in April and I love it!!"
Moved to Portland 8 years ago and never looked back.      I do miss kolaches tho
California is great.  I liked San Mateo.  Portland Oregon.  Seattle Washington.  No air conditioning required in any of those spots.  Avoid Redding CA or any of those interior cities.  Really hot in the Summer.
"Nashville is better than houston in every way. I have lived in sacramento, denver, nashville, and now houston

I know TN doesn't meet your criteria, but you could consider there or atlanta, georgia is purple anyway"
"Many parts in Oregon, just outside of the Portland metro area, are more affordable."
It depends on where you are in the PNW.  Some areas aren’t bad.
"Charlotte, NC -- that's where I'm headed once I get a fully WFH job :)"
"I realize this is out of the blue, but I keep hearing good things about Pittsburgh and Milwaukee. I also like Richmond and NOVA but it’s $ there too (NOVA)."
Oh. Also consider areas outside of Philly and northwest of DC.
Kinda slept on but i know a few of my friends and family who’ve moved to either okc or Tulsa and love it and save a lot of money living there
What industry do you work?
Appalachia
"Troy New York, if you're OK the snow!"
Check out Pittsburgh.
"I've decided that I need a generator or I need to leave. No other option. I think we are getting the generator but if we weren't I think I decided on Wauwatosa Wisconsin. The people are friendly, the food is comfort food but pretty good, the service at all the restaurants we went to was good, the weather is nice, it doesn't get as cold as it used to, there's Door county and the Dells, plenty of lakes for swimming. My husband was born there and still has family there. We go 2-3 times per year to visit, but I wouldn't want to live where his family does. It's too small, backwoods"
"Tennessee, Arkansas, the Carolinas"
"I’ve been struggling with this, too. I travel for work though and get to experience a lot of cities, so you think I would have decided where else to go besides here by now.

This sounds weird, but I like Pittsburgh when I’m there because of the greenery and environmental scenery of the rivers/trees/mountains. I can’t relocate there for work though, so haven’t looked into cost of living much."
I moved to Florida. Yes still hurricane prone but irs near my family. Tired of the constant weather emergencies. Moved in April.
"Northwest Arkansas. Foothills of the Ozarks/Bostons .Fiber optic, public water, lots of land. Seasons, but not extreme ones. Same shenanigans in state government, but we've got a chance (again, shenanigans in state government) at getting abortion on the ballot; if we don't, I'm comforted that care is four hours away in Kansas instead of days/a flight away. Legal weed in Missouri, and you can live there/commute if you find a job in Bella Vista or one of the more northern small towns around Fayetteville. 

Cons: harder to find healthcare in general (I took forgranted Houston's proximity to incredible hospitals) and no Costco. Education suffers in poorer areas just like Texas though it seems."
Here to follow the thread. Feeling exactly the same
"Colorado is supposed to be pricey. I was looking this up a bit ago. One affordable place that I found that was liberal, even if the state/rural area isn't, is cincinnati. Cost of living compared to move of the liberal areas on the east cost was much better in Cincinnati.

If you have a semi decent job you can travel with, makemymove.com works with cities that will pay you (I think usually 2 to 5k) to move there. I applied and was approved for northern Indiana where I grew up."
I’m thinking New England. Anyone have a particular state or location to recommend?
Nashville for me
"Friends of ours moved to North Carolina. Good medical centers, not as hot as Houston, state is more purple than red."
Just move to Montgomery. Nothing ever happens there.
Tucson?
Check out Cincy. It’s actually a pretty cool little city and the weather is soooo much better!
"I'm in Ohio, but if I could ... Michigan."
"If you want cheap, go to Ohio. But get ready to be miserable during the long and cold winter months"
"The wonderful city of Solla Sollew, where they never have troubles, at least very few."
"NYC (only for a few years-partially career motivated), North Atlanta, San Diego, Philly suburbs, Charlotte, Chicago (winters are an issue), Orange County (housing mostly unaffordable unless you’re willing to supercommute (1hr+)), Raleigh, DC, Denver. That’s my current priority list excluding TX if I were to move. 

Long term goal is to claim EU citizenship and move there in about a decade or so. Likely central/southern Europe though due to work chances are I’ll end up in London."
I’ve been visiting and really considering Scottsdale AZ
Detroit.
"The middle states. Kansas, Utah, Arkansas, Tennessee."
"Tbh we have been looking at Chicago. Like affordable NYC and the COL is low given all the amenities. You’ll keep all the food options and has such amazing history.

I think if you want similar to Texas the Research Triangle is great. South and North Carolina are a bit better ran than Texas. 

Check out CityNerd on YouTube, he breaks a lot down. His video on Houston is great too."
"Lived in Atlanta for 8 years. Weather is beautiful, it's a big city but not overcrowded and lots of nature too. Definitely less expensive than other big cities.

I also noticed the Lancaster, PA area, it's within reach of 5 major cities"
It depends on what you’re into. Personally I might scurry to New Mexico or Utah.
"Omaha Nebraska isn’t a bad place. A lot more chill…cold in the winter…nice in spring, summer, fall. People are more relaxed, more kind, and easy going. Easy to fly out of if you wanted to take trips. 

North Carolina is very beautiful if you want mountains, sea and all that."
St. Louis needs you. Defend the Lou
Pittsburgh
"Chicago is quite nice and, while more expensive than Houston, still has a lower cost of living than many other large cities. It has beautiful architecture and parks, is quite diverse (albeit segregated), and easy access to nature (particularly in Wisconsin and Michigan). Tons of world-class museums, cultural amenities (top-notch symphony, opera, ballet, and music/arts scenes), and great food too."
im going to philly or back to manhattan. Im lucky I have family to help me and not that much to bring
I would look at states that have no state tax. Like Tennessee or Delaware.
I’ve legit been contemplating moving to Virginia… someone told me West Virginia is inexpensive and beautiful.
"Some of us came with family and didn't really have much of a choice.

If I stay in-state, I'm thinking Dallas. It's at least a bit further north and their transit system is surprisingly really good. They're putting in new rail and have more miles than we do already instead of having their mayor cabal cancel voted on projects left and right like ours is.

If I go out of state though, there's a few options. Midwest areas like Cincy or Indy, New Mexico with family, or maybe a college town somewhere. I feel like college towns would be a good option if you don't work a specific industry style job as they have more robust transit and are more dense by design. Or fuck it maybe Florida, I'm sure their politics and weather are even worse but if I'm gonna go out blazing in a coke fueled bender then what better place than Miami 😂"
"My suggestions: Charlotte, Milwaukee, Omaha, Raleigh, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh."
"We just moved from the Denver area to Houston suburbs. With all the people that have moved in, traffic, worst roads and home prices skyrocketing our insurance and taxes made it unaffordable. 
Compare 700,000 for a ranch style house small lot. To here new build one acre  480,000"
Go to Oregon
Habibi come to Greece
*waving bye* I’ve been other places you have to take the good with the bad. If there was one place that it was the best to live it would already be over crowded.
"A friend of mine moved to Minneapolis from Houston and apparently, it’s a pretty great city with strong social programs. I visited last year and it’s beautiful! I’m stuck in Texas until retirement but am seriously considering moving away from the Houston metro after this storm and the disastrous recovery."
"There is a reason why Houston is cheap and the cities you’d rather live in aren’t. If you want to move to a more livable/favorable place you are going to have to give on price/location/size. 

We live in Atlanta now, it’s similar to Houston but much prettier and the weather is much, much better. But also considering a move to NW WA."
O  my
Moved to Chicago from Houston and love it!
Yall need to travel more.  Everywhere is screwed up right now.
I wanna leave this place ASAP and I have decided to move back to NYC.
"San Diego, CA if you can afford it. Heaven on earth."
"Maybe go to those subreddits?

“Hey all, I’m considering quitting golf. Any hobbies you’d consider picking up?”

Atlanta maybe
"Take a good look at Michigan.  Not Detroit or Flynt, obviously, but look into Grand Rapids and Lansing. 

Tons of fresh water sources, nice summers, near big cities if want to go see a concert or just miss the metro vibe.  And land is cheap."
"My twin brother moved from Houston to Fort Collins and he loves it. Colorado is fun and beautiful. Yes, it is more expensive but I will take the bitter cold and snow that bleeds even into May over the alternatives a place like Houston or Texas has to offer. I currently live overseas but if I were to move back, I’ve considered Colorado as a place to relocate."
"I moved to Houston in 1976 with my parents.    Dad worked for Oil Companies and we had always moved around.
As luck would have it, I found the perfect man and married. 
I asked that he would think about retirement being in a place with 4 season. 
48 years later I’m still here, wanting so badly to move.      
I’ve lived in Peru, Las Vegas, NM, CO, OK, UT.    Would love to head north, CO, UT and maybe keep driving, looking for a new place to call home.
We live in Kingwood and I love our home in the forest, yes we were just hit by Beryl, so many down trees and homes without power, but the older community and its people would be missed."
“alaska” 💀
"I lived in Florida for a while and have never experienced what I have experienced here. Never had a power outage even after a hurricane .I moved here last year because of all the good things I have heard but it was all make belief. It’s like living with an abusive partner and refusing to see what they are doing to you. I am afraid of the rain now. I  almost afraid of everything here when it comes to infrastructure. I am ashamed to tell my friends if Florida of my experience as they thought I was moving to the best state in America. 
A small storm is not supposed to take out your light even a simple lightning means no electricity for days."
"There are going to be disasters everywhere.

That said, the midwest is probably your best bet, especially the eastern part, when it comes to climate change (no hurricanes, plentiful water, still got tornados and floods though, but we have those plus more)

It’s not in the US, but look at Toronto for example. They just dealt with some absolutely horrendous flooding, with roads and houses being inundated. It was a really crazy event. Only 167,000 lost power, in a metro area of 6 million people. And this was for weather they are totally not set up for. Like our freeze, for example. And look how that turned out for us…

You can’t escape climate change. Everywhere will be affected. But you could at least go somewhere that doesn’t encourage corruption and failure to prepare to the extent that Texas does."
Montana is about the safest choice but it's farmland so if you ain't got a green thumb you won't survive but like nothing ever happens there .. lol
Sioux City Iowa or Omaha Nebraska is nice
Chicago has comparable housing prices and expenses.
I’m checking out Costa Rica now. I could sell my home here and pay cash for one there. Just need to learn fluent Spanish! I’m very intrigued by what I’m finding.
My company has offices in a few other cities including Chicago that I may be eligible for transferral to
Canada
"My choice would be, Colorado- maybe denver outskirts during hot times, Cozumel during the cold times."
J
I am from Colorado if you want to talk
Ohio has the largest number of Texas transplants (people that move from Texas to another state). I lived there for a bit. Was nice. Lived in a little area called Kettering. It was probably the nicest place I've ever lived.
Pittsburgh come to mind. Just need to find a job up there.

You don’t want to move. You want everything you want without spending lots of money. Of course you want to go to CO or the PNW. So does everyone else. And they already have.
Check out Cincinnati or Columbus Ohio

"I am in the same position. I want to move out of TX due to all the same reasons. I also have 3 daughters.

I would love suggestions on good places to move to that don't have super high cost of living & safer for women. I have always lived in smaller towns & work as a bookkeeper."
It’s hot af here ain’t it! I always thought about Washington
I love this trend! Please everybody bring houston housing back down!
Go to California. I hear it’s great there
We’re looking at Illinois. Got friends near the St Louis side of the state so a major city isn’t that far (in Texas terms) and Chicago is only 3-4 hours the other way iirc. That might be an idea
"My husband and I have been thinking about it too. But at this point if Trump wins there's gonna be no escape. It's gonna be hell everywhere, especially for women."
"Chattanooga, TN. I call it a reverse Davy Crockett. I’ve visited a couple times this year. Beautiful place. Smallish city. Good midsized university, awesome hiking, biking, bouldering, water access, outdoor activities. Homes are still affordable but they are going up. Fairly progressive vibe. Just unionized the first auto plant in the south. Growing tech jobs in shipping/distribution logistics, nuclear. Two hours from Nashville, Birmingham, Atlanta, Knoxville. I think a bunch of Texans have moved there recently and they might not be too happy about it, but that’s gonna be most places we would go."
"I just came back from a roadtrip in New England. I visited Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Massachusetts for 2 weeks and I loved it. 

A mix of old money glamour and blue color working class grunge, unique demographics (instead of Asians and Latinos it’s French and Portuguese speakers with a heavy dose of Italian and Irish Catholic), cute towns and sophisticated college cities, easy access to both mountains (beware of bears) and rugged coastline (beware of cold beach water). Colonial history just casually deposited in every nook and cranny. Beautiful flowers and trees everywhere since its mild weather. Heavy emphasis on farmer markets and locally sourced seafood. 

If I could get a job in my field up there with comparable pay I’d move up there in a heart beat. It’s like a microcosm of America in one concentrated area."
"Gus in Lonesome Dove told Lorena: “life in San Francisco you see is still just life. If you want anything too badly, it’s likely to turn out to be a disappointment. The only healthy way to live life is to learn to like all the little everyday things, like a sip of good whiskey in the evening, a soft bed, a glass of buttermilk…”"
"Pittsburgh, it’s cheap, pretty, up and coming, ppl are chill, and food is decent."
The next best state after Texas is Tennessee
"Salt Lake City. It’s overlooked and it’s growing, strong job market and companies are starting to relocate there, more diverse than you think, friendly and welcoming people. Good sports town (Utah Utes, Utah Jazz, Real Salt Lake, and now an NHL franchise starting up this fall). I visited there back in December and I was blown away. Beautiful mountains, scenery access is a lot closer than Denver, views for days. Very clean city, safe and well planned infrastructure. I plan on going back there in the fall. Not to mention they will be hosting the Winter Olympics again in 2034, which will be epic."
Best of luck! I want out too.
Cleveland. Especially if you work in healthcare 
"I recommend St. Louis. Great place to live, great options for fun, LCOL.  Baseball. Great medical options!!"
"Colorado was great for 4 years, but afterwards lost its charm.

No way am I working at Dominos in addition to my full time job, to make ends meet."
I'm in Houston myself. In my opinion there are better and worse places to live. Lots of people are coming to Texas and for various reasons.  Pretty much every city is going to have their climate issues and politics.  The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence.  I also caution you to move where you can have a decent paying job.   Money problems suck no matter the climate or the politics.
"Northwest Arkansas, it’s small but cosmopolitan because there are so many people there from somewhere else to service walmart suppliers. Beautiful mountains and lakes nearby, seasons, prosperity, and good cultural facilities and museums thanks to Alice Walton. Thriving University too in Fayetteville down the street."
"El Gallo, 2 locations - Jones Rd and Gessner."
Anywhere. Although you can’t run away from yourself.
"Well, I really just want to move out of the COUNTRY for 4 years, but I have been fantasizing about going back to Chicago for a long time. I've tried liking Houston/Texas for years but, I just don't. Sad."
"Upstate NY is going to be safe from the worst effects of global warming for a longer time than the rest of the US, and will end of holding a lot of southern refugees in the coming decades. Aim for Rochester. The rust belt will polish up nicely with a little work, and there’s a lot of people who are living in places that will be uninhabitable in the next 30 years."
"r/houston?

Wants to leave Texas?

Have you tried a different city that isn't Houston?"
Move to Arkansas.
Bye
"Don't worry, we don't want you here lol"
Bye
East St Louis
Tennessee isn’t a bad option. Nashville is ok. Virginia is nice also.
I hear Detroit is nice this time of year
"Few more of these, and maybe we will have our state back. In the meantime, I'll keep telling the world we are full."
I’m probably gonna go back to San Antonio in the near future I’m kinda tired of this shit hole as well
I’m moving back home to Chicago tired of this heat and disasters
"I just moved back to Houston from Oregon. Portland is well beyond its previously hip reputation but the western suburbs in Washington County are great. No homeless camps, responsive police and an increasingly exciting food scene. You could easily venture into Portland but I found myself going into town less and less since Covid."
"I'm looking at Virginia Beach (but not really beach more like Norfolk), Baltimore, and Detroit. -For those that voted Minnesota - I agree!!! It's a great place but just be prepared for those winters!"

My wife and I are planning on moving out within a few years. The only thing keeping us here is my elder in-laws and our low mortgage compared to anything we’ve seen recently.
Oregon or New Mexico or Michigan or Minnesota.   All good choices.  All have various levels of industry and housing is usually less than the national average (ok... outside of Portland).   All of them have beautiful scenery and fresh air.
Jacksonville Florida
come to NJ
"Hot weather? My dude, climate change is here...... Any state will seem novel at first. If I were looking to move, I'd try to list out the things I like/don't like about where I live currently. Then find the area that will give you more of the things you enjoy and fewer of the things you don't. If not, why else bother moving?

For instance, if I moved, I'd be losing my family which I am close to, basically all of my friends and the company I work for.

The only reason why I would consider moving is if it gives me something I don't have here, cheaper housing, more walkable, better weather, better job, better scenery, better health prospects, lower crime, etc. If moving isn't life changing, I'm not bothering at the moment."
I moved back to Europe. Sanity
"For anyone that's looking for support as we all figure this out, I am hosting a [meetup](https://www.reddit.com/r/HoustonSocials/comments/1e4yheq/leaving_texas_support_meetup_thursday_718_reza/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) at Reza Persian Grill this Thursday, 7/18 to figure it out together. I hope to see y'all there!"
"We left Houston due to jobs and ended up in North Carolina. 
This summer has been hotter than most, but we’re okay because we know it will end (for now at least) 

If I had my choice though, I’d look into chattanooga, TN 
It’s beautiful with tons of outdoor options. Smaller City so less expensive than your Denvers, Portlands, or Nashvilles."
Then go to colorado?
Byee
You don’t like the politics but you want affordable housing… there may be a correlation.
Please not Colorado. We have enough texans (and everyone else). 
See ya :) go post this in some other city’s sub. It’s literally an “anything but Houston” post which doesn’t belong here.
"I don’t blame you, I would leave too, and this is also what the GOP wants. I live in the PNW and love it here."
"If you just want to get out of Houston because of hurricanes, tornadoes, crazy storms and terrible infrastructure (which I also want to),but still good to be in Texas, Austin could be a good option."
"Centerpoint CEO and goverment  is reading this and going *""wayment, no ya'll are not leaving, we will close the borders before we let ya'll leave ""*

Sorry it looks like Texas may yet get to the point where they no longer allow citizens to leave in fear that they will not return"
A new week means a new help me get out of Texas post. Hopefully this fills the quota so I don’t have to see a post like this again.
"man being born and raised here, I guess im just blind to it. I really dont see Houston as that bad a place to live, especially if you consider the entire greater houston area. like yea the weather sucks but leaving would probably increase my cost of living or i would lose diversity, probably both."
"Move to California. 

Get out of Texas. 😂"
"Did you ever wonder WHY Houston is so much more affordable than NYC, LA and Chicago?

Oh well... The entire west coast is out of your price range. So is the upper east coast. The gulf coast is all hot and red (they all get hurricanes too). What about Minneapolis? It's plenty cold & everyone will agree with you. Maybe Detroit?

Anyways, congrats! Let us know what cold, cheap, liberal paradise you find!"
"Kansas or Kansas City. Food is comparable to Houston, new areas with new construction and lots of land, and nice weather compared to Houston."
"For my wife and I, we are moving to Oregon. Yes the cost of living seems higher, but so is state minimum wage and salaries to begin with. Not sure what professions you all are in but I know for our family it's what we're going to do. My wife will be able to make 80% more over the next three years as a nurse due to union contracts. Use the MIT living wage calculator to see if a move will be financially worth it. The data was updated earlier this year. 


Texas is 33rd in energy rankings while Oregon is 9th. The states average electric bill is sub 150. Your car insurance will drop probably 40%. But your groceries and housing will be more, as will gas."

"Stop moving to Mexico and Hawaii!! The locals do not want any more Americans colonizing their countries. 

That being said if you can find a place in the U.S. that caters to your needs and wants MOVE MY PEEPS!! I want to move too. I think I could move to my parent’s native country but I’m disabled sooo I don’t think I’d survive the heat and the environment."
Louisiana.
"Everywhere has hot weather at least once in a while. But if you want to avoid Texas-style heat, just head north. The red state/blue state thing varies over time and isn’t permanent, but remember that most blue states have state taxes on income and usually cost more. Minnesota or Illinois might be more your style though.

You might also want to consider moving abroad. Scotland is pretty cool year round. The temperature in Glasgow today? 67 degrees! Plus no red/blue nonsense to worry about."
"Consider Indianapolis. Been here from Houston for 15 years. Moving soon, but its a nice family city."
"Bentonville, AR

Huntsville, AL

The food, culture/entertainment aren't as good, but the cost of living is comparable and both have most of the big city amenities"
"Orlando...no state taxes, good food, nice people and you are close to the mouse. Just dont move close to Disney."
"Denver can go fuck itself. Give me Estes Park or give me death. 

BRB gonna go die."
"LA is basically what Houston modeled its self after

So there's that"
"It's the same crap everywhere you go, and it's that way because you're not the only one thinking this, and wanting to move. 

To add unto that, this same movement only ends up making things difficult for the locals wherever you end up moving. 

Happened to Houston, used to be very cheap and the tradeoff was the issues we've always dealt with to varying degrees. Now we still have those same problems at a higher cost of living. Damn transplants."
"We are exploring the same.  We actually moved from Colorado to Texas (North Padre Island).  We lived in Costa Rica for 5 years and came back to be closer to elderly parents  I am a native from Colorado growing up in Denver.  What a shock going home - Denver has grown at an unprecedented rate.  The infrastructure was not designed for the rapid growth.  Colorado is an amazing state with lots to offer, but unfortunately is not an option  as it has become unaffordable.  We love our beach life, but really miss hiking, biking, river fly fishing, and trees.  We've spent the last month in Tennessee - Chattanooga and Knoxville areas.  Although a ""red state"" we haven't seen a single Trump bumper sticker, flag or lawn sign.  Lower home prices, lower property taxes, similar vehicles registration fees to Texas and no state income tax.  Chattanooga is pretty cool and very central - 2 hours to Atlanta if you need a big city, 2 hours to Nashville and 1:30 to the Great Smoky Mountains national park.  Cool town, reminds me a bit of Boulder.  We're leaning towards making this move."
Good no one here in Texas wants yall democrat losers anyways good riddance move to Canada you might like their prime minister he seems to be doing good at taking away peoples freedoms
Canada is the way!
It's like everytime there's a bit of discomfort people just up and leave and I want them to its usually the type of asshole to jump from one city to the next because they can never be pleased good riddance
"For those saying you wanna run to blue states because they ""treat women better"" you might want to wait and see who wins the election because if Trump and Vance wins along with MAGA taking the house and senate because dumbass elite democrats want to push Biden aside instead of supporting him, they'll be a national abortion ban and traitor dems who back stabbed Biden will be the ones to blame. Many dems stand by Biden but the elite rich liberals and the media think they have a right to call the shots for all of us. I am furious about all the infighting and have never been so embarrassed to be a liberal before. We're a joke. We repeatedly shoot ourselves in the foot every time. The GOP proudly stands behind that felon and rapist Trump yet we can't support the best progressive president we've ever had and when democracy is on the line so we deserve to lose. I'm a POC woman and I'm staying. I love Houston and was born and raised here and I'm not letting the GOP or weather run me from my home so I will do all I can to change things such as vote. The grass is not always green on the other side just because of the way a state votes and if the dems keep screwing over Biden and eroding support, you best believe it will be a national abortion ban for sure. Then it won't matter where we live."
Well…bye.
Bye! 😂

Good. One less pansy in Texas!
Can’t you dispute a misclassification? They have to prove you were not an employee and can get in a lot of trouble.
Lina Hidalgo mentioned a short term $750 assistance that you could apply for through the Greater Houston Disaster Alliance. There’s a link in [this](https://abc13.com/post/how-get-help-after-beryl-hurricane-recovery-fund/15061823/) article. Supposedly as fast as 48 hours.
"You should apply for FEMA.GOV assistance right away. Do it online. They will help with the $750

Then I’d look to see what side hustle you can get into. Do you have a vehicle? Door dash, Uber, etc for quick cash till things stabilize"
"Lots of food distribution sites available this week. Check websites at Houston Food Bank, Baker Ripley, local precincts, churches etc.

Good luck!"
And I hate hate hate typing this but if you are in a bind financially it’s kind of a last resort option: consider plasma donation which can pay a few hundred dollars.

Look for clean up jobs!!!
"Real talk? I’ve been without anything before and lived in a tent in a state park for a year with raccoons as neighbors. Take what work you can get and volunteer when you can’t. I got more help volunteering than anywhere and I didn’t feel like I was taking handouts. Don’t leave any gaps on your employment record and volunteerism looks great.

Find out where needs are and seek to fill them. Who knows, it might turn into self employment 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Call the Catholic Church nearest you and speak to their St Vincent de Paul society. You don’t have to be Catholic to get help from them. It might be worth an ask.
"How long had you worked there? If you were there in 2023, did you get a W-2 or 1099?"

Definitely put in an application for fema stat if you haven’t already. I just got approved today.
Not sure if it helps but Shell FCU is offering a disaster relief loan up to 15k. You’ll have to provide any photos and receipts of anything you may have had to spend money on.
"Apply for disaster relief. Make sure to note everything that you needed to pay for due to the hurricane. I was initially denied but as of yesterday was approved for $750.

There’s a way to appeal for up to $42k if needed according to the letter I received.

You can still get unemployment they’re doing disaster benefits now
FEMA is hiring … get paid to help out!
I took out a loan from my bank to keep me from going under.

Tacos Dona Lena on Hammerly is hiring and in desperate need of staff. Can't guarantee how much you'll make but something is better than nothing.
"There is so much work out there right now with the storm. Yard cleanup, fence work, tree cutting, basic roof repairs, etc. If I wasn’t so busy with work I would start doing that on the side.  You gotta find ways to make that bread. It ain’t gonna come to you."
Disasterassistance.gov is a great resource. Texas has also opened Disaster Unemployment so you may qualify now. I would reach out to Texas workforce for more information.
Try SER jobs and see if they can help you with an employment opportunities. YMCA is also hiring at the moment
"I was misclassified and reported to the TWC and the IRS. Both found my claim to be true. However, I didn't get a dime from that employer. It did shift business practices in that niche industry (yoga studios). Good luck to you!"
"Just a silent observer here— but you all that take the time and effort to respond to someone in need like this is truly impressive. As a member of the houston community and fellow human, I praise you all for helping OP and anyone else who may benefit.  Kudos to you all "
"I'm willing to bet that ""incorrect classification"" was by intent."
Call 311
"I know this isn't of great help but fema is giving critical needs funding if you went without power had to use gas during outage of 750 instant approval .. just fill out application online they will direct deposit within 48 to 72 hrs.. make sure you check the box that says you need help with gas ,diapers critical needs box on application

You can also upload pics for inspectors for other claims damages like flooding lines in your home destroyed food or personal items like furniture etc.. it will help process other funding amounts faster."

You said here you were a contractor so I’m confused ?"
You didn’t notice you didn’t have payroll taxes taken out of your check?
i swear so many places do that independent contractor BS. had to put my foot down this year to get a proper W2
"wait. a contractor can't get unemployment checks? that doesn't sound correct. when i was laid off years ago as a contractor, i was able to get unemployment checks. has the law changed?"
I would suggest checking on your status by reviewing [TWC Independent Test](https://efte.twc.texas.gov/appx_e_twc_ic_test.html). File unemployment benefits if you’re not independent per TX laws.
"If you have a car payment, most will defer your monthly payment & just add another month to your term"
"I am struggling myself and I just made a Gofund me out of desperation. I made $1,000 in one day."
What line of work are you in?
Why can’t you collect unemployment as an independent contractor? 1099/gig workers were getting unemployment during the pandemic.
An employment attorney can file a lawsuit and would absolutely do it on contingency if you have a legit claim.

Next FEMA is covering food loss their website is off and on and been crashing (many people applying in a major city) but I was approved for 750.00 so that will help you.

The CenterPoint outage tracker is literally the most useless website ever.  Ever since the last storm and we had the major outages they switched to that which offers no insight whatsoever.

>Hurricane Beryl has maintained a surprising amount of punch as it rocks through the Houston area Monday morning.

>""It’s been very impressive,"" Space City Weather’s Matt Lanza told Chron.

>The system is expected to be out of the city by noon, Lanza said, at which time residents will have a chance to assess damage—safely.

>""\[Beryl’s impacts\] should be manageable tomorrow,"" Lanza said. ""If you have a generator, try and share it. Check up on people.""

>Lanza noted that Beryl showed significant resilience even after making landfall on Monday. Expectations were for the storm’s wind gusts to weaken to 65 mph as it reached Houston, but the system maintained wind blasts in excess of 80 mph.

>""I think a lot of people were caught off guard by how strong winds like that are,"" Lanza said.

Edit: Flight was cancelled."
"Clear-lake. I hope everyone comes out of this safely with no damage to property, or major outages. But I'm loco and can't help but be excited for every TS/hurricane. If it doesn't get crazy I may even steal a soak in the pouring rain. Been a while"
"77070 nw cypress willlowbrook area, powers out already guess it was bound to happen since the wind was above 2mph :rolls eyes:

(granted the wind is high)"
"77494 (Katy) lost power an hour ago. According to the power alert, the outage is currently affecting approximately 3757 customers and they estimate repairs by 7:30 AM....which is right when the eye of the storm is moving there so I'm skeptical."
Is it common for new leaks to show up during a hurricane? I’ve got like three buckets going right now
"https://www.youtube.com/live/z7XOiA8rVSk?si=5VY09Ekj1-hUeaGQ

Our neighbors in Galveston are quite flooded. Apparently the waters breached the seawall too. "
I’m convinced my dog is going to need rehab from the trazadone she’s had to take the past 2 days. Poor girl.
"[Here's a loop of the 12z HRRR run.](https://imgur.com/a/AHyGbO5)

Looks like a widespread rain event for most of the metro area with a corridor of strong winds likely for areas along a line from Sargent / West Columbia / Richmond.

It's a raggedy looking system right up until it gets its shit together approaching the coast and then organizes quickly into a compact hurricane. 

The trough cutting across the central US will absorb the low pressure system and kick it off the NE quickly which is good, but models are also hinting at a trailing line of training storms along the coast even after Beryl progresses into Louisiana and Arkansas. Definitely something to keep an eye on in terms of additional flooding potential."
Katy getting pounded right now
77518. The only thing I'm worried about is the wind. The doomer in me tells me to board up my windows just in case. The lazy ass me says fuck no.
"77406- fairly heavy rain and wind moved in starting a little after 4.  Though at least at the moment it's calmed down.  Wind is mostly gone and a lighter rain


Not enthusiastic about the fact that the path keeps creeping ever closer my way"

77573. All is quiet in League City.
77021. I just moved to Houston last week so this is sort of a doozy. I hope it’s not too bad 🥲🥲
"77459

The evening was eerie. Frogs were croaking, a tree roach tried to get in, typical summer night. 

Now the storm begins. My anxiety has kicked in. I have my 8 month old next to me to protect her"
77030. Light rain at the hospital. Already know I’m in for an 18+ hour shift.
77006 Montrose. Just felt the first gust that shook the house a little.
The National Hurricane Center should be issuing an update at 4am.
"77007 - Hearing transformers blowing every now and again, sometimes close, sometimes far. Power has gone out a few times, sometimes for a few minutes, but comes back. Definitely getting some wicked gusts, but I'm guessing it'll only get worse."
I was sleeping so good till that damn alert went off
"No power, new leaks, house is making new noises, and fences and trees look like they’re on the verge of giving up on the good fight."
"77007 - Heard a big crash. Looks like the neighbor across the street has had a tree fall over. Blocking the entire road. Still have power and Internet somehow, though."
"Been awake 1.5 hrs.  Wife is happily sleeping, so cheers to that."
"Just took a look outside, the clouds are zooming, pretty wild. Centerpoint says 1.3 million without power now."
Just lost power in the montrose.

I just charged my phone to 80% and now it’s back to 70% from doom scrolling.
"77584, we plan to put things in the garage that can blow away and then wait it out. Not worried about flooding, but the wind is what has us a bit worried. 

Other than that it’s business as usual for us."
77022 - first rain band came and went. Made a giant ass pot of gumbo last night (my inner Cajun mandated it) so we're all set I think. I work from home but my boss is in Wisconsin so I think I'm gonna play this puppy up and get another day off
"086 keeping it simple with mild storm prep. Grilled cheese and tomato basil soup for dinner, peach cobbler for dessert. Hoping the power doesn't get froggy on us come tomorrow.


Made some sheltered spots for the rando neighborhood wilds that people keep feeding and not fixing. Put googly eyes on our mailbox in case we get street wading levels for a photo op. Basically, I'm just happy for a little rain and a little wind to clean everything off."
Fukkk. Looks like the track is now much closer to me in 77077.
"Just had my flight back to Houston canceled. Looks like United canceled a whole slate of tomorrow flights. 

I knew it was going to happen but am annoyed United waited until after midnight to do so. "
77030 working at the hospital. Just drizzles here
"77043, Memorial City. Raining steady but not hard, wind is blowing for sure but not hazardous. First solo hurricane (unless you count my dog) so I'm riding this one out playing Elden Ring so I can keep an eye on the weather."
"77450- katy. Can’t sleep, my first hurricane is making landfall!! It’s not too bad yet but the gusts of wind and rain are pretty loud! I keep trying to go back to sleep but then I’m jolted awake. I may as well just stay up at this point and watch it all unfold. 🫣"
"77479 W of the Brazos, power out. Sounds like the large lines went down from the direction of the electrical explosion sound"
"Anyone in the 77023/East End/Downtown area online to give me an update? 
Concerned cat mom currently in NM 
🥺👉🏽👈🏽"
It's beginning to sound like a hurricane
"77004. Power out. Sad day, we didn’t lose it during the freeze."
Imagine being in a boat and getting caught in a hurricane out at sea. Pure nightmare fuel with that deep dark abyss swirling around you.
trees and powerlines fighting for their lives out there but at least there's some daylight now
Will this be the worst of it or is it supposed to get worse?
"If this is your first Hurricane in Houston, then be sure to take a quick step outside (only if safe to do so) during the peak winds to see the trees move and sway in ways you never thought possible. It can be pretty trippy to see."
"I vote for you as a mod. Seriously. All of the megathreads lately have been done by you, not the mods"
Houston Zoo announced closing today at noon and closed all day tomorrow.
"77025, I've got plenty of liquor and books. Also a first aid kit and tall boots!!"
"77070.


More rain. Complex took up all the patio chairs and tables for the storm but its not stopping people from using the pool. Guy even brought a speaker and then covered it with a trash bag to protect it from the rain. "
"77004 Museum District. I’m a renter, and things are good and calm for now.

I have a flight scheduled out of IAH tomorrow morning at 6:00am. Seems almost certain to be delayed or cancelled at this point. I can also do Tuesday night out of IAH, should the storms be out of the metro by then?"
thank god for dry air!!!
Just officially upgraded to Cat 1 hurricane (as expected)
"Yo buds, what is the protocol for when my dog needs to poop tomorrow morning?"
"I’m in Phoenix, but I have a son in 77052, elderly mom in 77084, and brother with his young kids in 77433. I will be watching for updates in those areas because I don’t want to be texting them all night asking if they’re ok. Thanks friends!"

"Working in 77030, just checked on my cat via security camera, power is still on in 77054! Kitty is safe and sound sleeping!! Hopefully I'll be able to get home to her in the morning."
"I live on a very high floor and usually have a great view of the city. For now, everything seems fine from up here. The rain is moderate, and I can barely see the city due to the weather. There's the occasional sound of wind, but those sudden storms from 1-2 months ago around 5-6 PM were much worse."
Dirty side of the storm is no joke
"Does anyone know what these random flashes of light are? At first I thought it was lightning, but I hear nothing afterwards"

I’m watching channel 11 and they have this poor reporter live from the bucees parking lot getting soaked
"The hours leading up to landfall are always the spookiest. I've noticed this before Ike and Harvey, but it feels like the whole city is holding its breath."
the extra long nap after beryl passes by going to feel like heaven
I see the outage tracker is still not back up. This is going to be a fun Monday!
77578. Brought everything in from the backyard. Didn’t put boards up. I’m not overly concerned other than my neighbors complete lack of concern means they’re securing nothing.
"77084 - brought in all of the plants. Both cars parked in the garage. Got my beer and groceries. Propane tank is full for grilling. Kids have their electronics. Making sure the back up chargers are ready and everything else is charged. Where I live (529/Barker Cypress), we tend to lose power anytime it rains with a slight wind, so preparing for the worst. With the Derecho this year, we lost power for just over 2 days."
"77063 Westchase....All I need are some tasty waves, a cool buzz-- and I'm fine..."

"77396 the mini hurricane party I threw myself to hopefully knock me tf out so I could sleep through the storm did NOT work

Gusting winds and heavy rain. Quick walk around the house to confirm....storm is definitely storming."
"One silver lining to this, there wasn't the typical massive lightning storm as the hurricane arrived this time.  Just wind and rain."
77459 I'm so done with this wind. My house is making noises I never knew it could make in my over 20 years of living here. 
Water is backing up in Montrose now. It's over the curb near Richmond and Montrose. Trees falling. 77006

"Ain’t no power high, ain’t no power low."

Without power still, and although the 5G/LTE bars are showing full, data is extremely spotty with few websites loading."
77027 power restored
"Target at Westheimer & Shepard is open, see a decent amount of people going in and out"
"I would also add warmlines: [https://www.warmline.org/](https://www.warmline.org/)

From their website:

""A warm line is an alternative to a crisis line that is run by “peers,” generally those who have had their own experiences of trauma that they are willing to speak of and acknowledge. Unlike a crisis line, a warm line operator is unlikely to call the police or have someone locked up if they talk about suicidal or self-harming thoughts or behaviors. Most warm line operators have been through extreme challenges themselves and are there primarily to listen. A warm line has the purpose of reducing hospitalization and forced treatment, being a cost effective and non-intrusive, voluntary intervention.""

Disclaimer: I've never tried this service, but it seems like a nice alternative to a hotline if you aren't in an immediate emotional crisis but just need someone to talk to. I did not link to any specific Texas warmline since there are several."
77493 and we lost power yesterday in “normal” rain so all the Katy evacuate jokes are seeming like a nice idea 🤦🏼‍♀️

What are the odds we’re sleeping at IAH for a couple days?"
"77057 just moved here a month ago and live on the second floor of an apartment. But we’re from the east coast so not totally new to hurricanes. Been fine all day but starting to get kind of antsy/anxious. Have a feeling sleep is gonna be choppy. But oh well, we’re as prepared as we can be and the office gave us the go ahead to wfh tomorrow. All we can do is let nature take its course"
77004 light rain and winds beginning to slightly pick up downtown. Just the beginning!

Anxiously refreshing twitter and Reddit every few minutes to get some new data on the pressure and velocity of the storm. Hoping it stays at 10+ mph for the duration of the storm
"Over 750k ""customers affected"" per the Centerpoint tracker. Really wish their map was up and running."
everyone just slowly losing power and its creeping up north.... i'm in spring and just waiting for the inevitable. should i crank my AC down
"77015, i10 East and BW8: currently with power.

My work on the other side of town has not contacted me about whether or not I have to go in but in the words of Sid the Sloth: “No thanks, I choose life.” I ain’t driving in this."
77494 update : on my 3rd modelo … I only have 3 more ….. 
77004 I just watched the outer siding of a townhouse style apartment complex get shredded off. Near Elgin and Emancipation
Any (serious) guesses on power restoration? Hours? Days?

A ton of relatives were all nearer to it and it was going off for minutes earlier this hour. Took me 7 minutes to get to it and not a single person woke up besides me. 


Seems kinda like a shitty sound to use for a fucking tornado alert if nobody young enough is near. If there was a tornado and I wasn't home then my family would have never known till it hit us."
Enough sunlight to see how violently the trees are shaking outside. 
"77008 near 19th and Yale, power just went out for good after flickering for about 10 minutes. 



What really surprised us on our dog walk late last night is how little work people did taking things off their patios and lawns. Not seeing much stuff blow around but I’m sure there will be a lot of collateral damage from people’s laziness. "
"77009, hopefully not jinxing myself but still have power. First hurricane in my first house and been just pacing my house since 4am. Crazy gusts every few minutes but the rain has been very manageable so far."
77063 Gessner/Westheimer - lost power at around 5am. A tree fell down in our backyard. The tree was already dead though it survived derecho and not Beryl. Should've cut it down when we had a chance. Glad it didn't fall on our house. Stay safe y'all.
"77041 jersey village power still on, honestly surprised."
"Spring/Woodlands, power has gone out maybe 10 times lasting max 1 minute. Looking at radar it’s about to get worse here for about 3 hours. Strong wind and rain so far."

Where did all their profits go for the last 40 years???  They keep adding to the grid but with no modern technology for controls.  Everyone in ERCOT and CenterPoint needs to be fired."

77055 seeing flashing of transformers in the distance
"Just woke up in Galleria due to the wind. I can feel the gusts through my window. Power is still on (for some reason I've never lost power in my 4 years of living here even though my apt neighbors have).

Wind isn't as strong as the derecho wind, but obviously more sustained.

Edit: 5 min after writing this, the wind just stopped completely. Like a switch was turned off. Weird."

"77089. Lots of rain. Lots of wind. Big tree branch killed my porch swing. Took my dog out back to pee while I pulled the branch off the porch away from the patio doors about an hour ago. 

Not terrible then, but it’s getting pretty rough as of about 5:15. Lost power four times for a few minutes, but it keeps coming back. Fear for my air conditioner being power surged to death.

Edit: power went out just after I posted. Center Point says it’ll be back by 8:45am. I’ll see it when I believe it. I thought the boom I heard was the branch hitting my swing, but I guess it might have been a transformer."

"2 killed by fallen trees in Houston area

A 53-year-old man was killed by a fallen tree while riding out Hurricane Beryl with his family, according to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez.

The man, his wife and children were in a house in Atascocita in the Houston area when an oak tree fell on the roof, hitting the rafters, the sheriff said. The structure then fell on the man, killing him.

His wife and children were not hurt, the sheriff said Monday morning.

Hours later, the sheriff said a 74-year-old woman was killed when a tree fell on a home in Houston.

Shit just picked up considerably on the west side. Must be on the other side of the eye now.
77008 near TC Jester and 11th. No power since some time in the middle of the night as soon as the rain and wind picked up.
77006 — Lost power around 8:00am and it’s still out at 12:30pm. I haven’t ventured outside yet. 
"Been without power and water in 77027 for over 4 hours now. Data finally started working 30 mins ago (T-Mobile).

No flooding here."
"Map now shows the center line going through sealy, tx.  Every update it moves more toward houston."
"I'm not worried about the storm. I swear I'm habituated to Cat 1 storms now since I've lived here my whole life. 

The easiest way to handle a hurricane is to hunker down in a safe place like my house because turn around/don't drown. 
Except for the fact that my job expects me in by 11am tomorrow after .48 in of rain every hour for 9 hours straight..."
Anyone else find it eerily relaxing to just sit/stand outside right now? Maybe it’s the sense of impending unknown and this is coming from someone who’s right on the path of expected sustained hurricane force winds
"Wow, the eye is on track to pass over downtown. This is the first time I've been in the track"
"If anyone is in dire need of a place to go (tree through your roof or something like that), I just heard that Gallery Furniture is allowing people to shelter in their store."
77077. About to go for a run before the rain.
"77062. Just got word from work that we're all expected to work our regular hours tomorrow remotely. If we lose power, we need to report it immediately, and the next work update will be given after 12pm tomorrow."
77005 - I’ll move the plants inside for now. We will see what happens in a few hours
Just drove by Washington HEB and whole foods.  They looked packed.
Thoughts on my ability to make it to work in the Med Center from Missouri City area Monday morning?
"77062 holding it down for Clear Lake. 

Pretty sure the winds will be taking out part of our fence I pointed out to the insurance adjuster after the hail storm that he ignored me on, so gonna go rig a way to secure it here in bit after this band moving through peters off. Going to be playing Elden Ring as long as there’s power and doing block rounds hourly to keep drains clear. 

CoH OEM is still level III (increased readiness). 

As additional preparedness, if you or someone you know has a disability, is medically fragile, has limited mobility, or has access/functional needs, go register for [STEAR](https://stear.tdem.texas.gov/Login.aspx) which lets first responders know and helps them better assess and respond to needs in the community. It’s free."
"Departures for Hobby Airport we just shut down

Can't figure out when this shits gonna really pop off. Landfall doesn't mean when it'll be on i10
"77459

Waiting on work to say it's closed for tomorrow. Already planned to call off. Work will probably try to have people brave the storm to go to downtown. 

Waiting on husband to get home from work so we can get formula and gas. 

Will try to instacart what I can"
77056 - 4:30pm dark skies and nothing really to report
77587 South Houston. Had a few bands pass through and drop an inch of rain already. Some spots in Pasadena already have received 1.5”.
"77080

HEB off Gessner and Kempwood wasn’t super busy. I think people forget it exists."
"77025 again, um, why is it only moving 10mph 🥴"
Anyone have a recommendation for a radio station to tune into for storm news and updates?
"77459, just woke up because my power went out and back on which triggered me smart lights. Happened two more times in a five minute period. Seems to be raining harder and pretty windy from what I hear. "
77583 Rosharon- The wind is strong here and it’s raining hard. Thankfully lights are still on
"77025 Willow Bend just south of Astrodome. First time I heard wind outside so I opened the door and went out. Yep, it's a hurricane. Horizontal rain and wind gusts like Ike in 2008. Watching the interaction between trees and power lines nearby, I don't see how we keep power. Just since I started this comment, the sound of wind and rain has picked up measurably."
77058 Nassau - raining sideways and been without power for ~30 minutes now. Kids are still PTFO while I’m enjoying my first hurricane ever.
Welp. There goes the power in 77518.
"77479 - power out, centerpoint texted repair by 6:45am? Guess we will see."
77019 - Winds really picking up now. Power all good so far.

"Just got power back in Galena Park, after being out for an hour and a half. I'm sure it won't last long."
77008 - Still have power but its cut out a few times and we flickering fam.
Next hour seems the most crucial based on radar. Metro area on the cusp of the eye wall
"77008

Heights & 13th near the Library. Lights went off for 10s and came back a few mins ago but been pretty solid so far. Got to survive the next 2 hours of peak winds before I can look forward to making it out of this. Peak rain rates appear to have passed now so its all about then wind. No flooding on my street."
"77006 montrose

Power has gone out about 6 times I can't believe it keeps cutting back on. Amazing"
"77005 lost power.

Lots of stuff coming down from the roof tops, shingles, gutter pieces, vent covers."

Annnnd it’s gone"

Posted this on the other thread: news mentioned a few minutes ago that 75% of CenterPoint’s grid is without power….worried about the bayous now 😬
"Anyone else jumpy and get startled by any random wind gust?

Took my dog out for a pee just now and it’s sad to see all the destruction and streets covered in green."
77380 power has been out 2.5hrs-ish. Resisting the urge to open the fridge to stare at food. Might give in soon.
Damn. The music KHOU plays behind their Weather Impact Alert segment is crazy. It’s like the score to a thriller meant to make you feel anxious.
Far SW Houston/Stafford area.  Already had a 2 hour power outage at 3AM this morning for whatever dumb reason.  Generac kicked right on though and we didn't even notice until we woke up and there was an alert on my phone.  Car is charged up.  Stocked up at the store earlier today also.  Should be good to go.
"So far no worse than a normal rain event here in the Sugar Land/Missouri City area. The wind has picked up, but nothing crazy (yet)."
"Dear centerpoint: 

Please tell your lazy programmers to put the ~~mail~~ map back up.

Edit: I hate autocorrect"
"back fence with my neighbor got knocked down, loving the bigger backyard"
"uh, has anybody started drinking yet or am I the only one? let's start a thread - I'm drinking a Jalapeno Ranch Water."
Who are the best storm chasers to watch these days?  Trying to capture the high from the Harvey blue shed again this year.
"What kind of name is ""Beryl"" anyway?"
Fuck Dan Patrick
77489 nothing but frogs
Couple cases of water and gased everything up. Going to fill bathtubs tonight. Cleaning the house today and already secured the backyard. Generator ready for action
77077. Starting to rain here pretty heavy.
77007. 2 bands of rain so far. Heavy rain and impressive lightning but wind hasn't been too bad. Nothing like the derecho yet. Glad I went to HEB yesterday.
"77069 - On and off rain, dark clouds, not much wind yet. Went out and got all my lose-ables secured. Need to go grab a tank of gas and I'll be all set."
"Up north in Conroe, was gonna do a quick trip to Houston today and then come back up around 7 or 8 PM, is it inadvisable to be on I45 today? I got the sense that the time to hunker down was late tonight/tomorrow morning but my work buddies are freaking me out"
77566 (Lake Jackson) getting a bit breezy here but nothing abnormal. More steady rain now vs quick 5 min heavy downpours
"77034 Ellington Airport area

Just a slight breeze."
77459 It sounds pretty bad out there which is making it difficult for me to try to get back to sleep. Probably stress from having to try to make it to work in the morning and worrying if my roof which is long overdue to be replaced will hold up. 😬
77084. Bearly windy. A bit rainy. Watching storm chasers live stream.  Someone on the livestream said there’s a fire at a plant but I haven’t seen anything about it anywhere else
"77071 - power on still, crazy wind, and rain."
77029 occasional high winds and rains beating the walls of the house. Power still up. Not even a flicker. Internet annoying has been out since before the storm. #fuckcomcast
77098 watching the radar [https://radar.weather.gov/](https://radar.weather.gov/) the heavy rain is going inside the loop right now

"77006. Apartment wall is already leaking, not looking forward to the next 8 hours."
77005 - heard a transformer blow then everything except street lamps went dark about 20 minutes ago.
Intermittent flashes and booms by Independence Heights Park. Possibly transformers? Still have power but I can hear it buzzing as it strains
77096 near Parker Elementary. Finally lost power after listening to the transformer struggle for the last hour.
77022- lights kept flickering turning on and off and it’s now completely out 🥲 so scary waking up to strong winds hearing the electricity poles getting hit by debris making them spark and cant even see well outside in the dark. It’s pitch BLACK
"77066 Willowbrook area - Power stayed on all night, right at an inch of rain through the gauge at 5:30.

Wind max 35 MPH.

Power stayed on until after I brewed coffee.  Got to my PC and power has now turned on and off about 7 or 8 times.

The longest it was off was about 25 seconds.  APC UPS devices kept my AT&T fiber and computer working.

I expect power will turn off and stay off for a while, soon."
"77598, power went off and on about eight to ten times tonight, and now it’s off and I’m afraid she’gone fer’good."
Seriously tho just when I think the worst of the storm got through it just keeps getting worse!! Scary af man

Power has gone up and down for up to 30 seconds multiple times in the last hour. Holding on for now."
"77479 no power .. lots of wind and rain, the construction workers across the street left an open bin of construction debris the last 2 weeks that’s going to scatter / hurt someone in this wind .."
77009 transformers blowing up every few minutes

The howling sounds so eerie though"

77584 finally lost power but at&t fiber still works great
"Lights have been off, but across the street still has power. Damn my luck."
"77098. Still thankfully have power. The wind is so loud in my apartment's courtyard, my neighbor just put all of her outdoor plants outside for the summer. RIP to those plants."
"77019 - no power. AC is still on miraculously, not sure how that works out."
"77433 getting gusts easily over 60 mph+ now, street water level is normal same with backyard. Very glad this wasn’t a stronger hurricane taking the path this one is."
Flickering in 77007 now
"77025 Willow Bend hats off to my local Center Point circuit breakers. Many stops and starts, but they've been fighting like Spartans at Thermopylae. I'm just hoping for a better ending."
77065  Power is on.  Wind is nuts.  Eye should be here in about an hour.
Per KHOU: An 18 wheeler overturned in La Porte. The Fred Hartman bridge is now closed in both directions.
77043 power has been out for 2 hours. A tall tree just fell on our building. The street is like a white water rapid.::..I’m ready for this to be over.
wind gusts are so bad that i can barely see the trees that just got downed
77007 Heights (Studemont/Yale) surprisingly still has power as of right now
"77006

Seems like the heaviest stuff has passed. Giant tree fell right by the house just missing it. Water is still high, which I'm working on getting now."
"Oddly, we have ""half"" power in 77043. Looks like we lost a phase and can only power low-voltage electronics (no major appliances). Anyone else experiencing the same?"
Has anyone had power restored? And if so what zip?
Gas station at N Main and Airline was open and has beer. Huzzah
Woodland residents. How are you guys doing? I always think about moving there for weather related reasons.
"My anxiety is so bad right now, I just want this to be over..."
Space City Weather just issued an update. Very reliable for those new or just not privy.
Beryl needs to be deported. Coming from across the ocean to start all this bullshit lmao
"77007, First Ward ready and vigilant, everything will be ok, some rain and some breeze, don’t over-panic"
Still no email/call from work saying we don't have to come into office tomorrow (downtown)...
At least the sun will be coming up soon...
"You might need to re-enroll in Centerpoint alerts. I was somehow unenrolled between the derecho and today. Anyway I re-enrolled and just got a robo call from them that was like, ""yep, your power is out, sorry."" 77009"
Generally consensus I see is everyone if fed up with these unrelenting life changing events and storms! Same..... Same.... My job in Katy is closed with no power and that place never goes out of power! Even during the tornado
"Local news be like: 

Beryl is currently a tropical storm ☹️,
But it could be a category 1 hurricane by landfall! 😃"
I do love this city for lots of reasons but I do have to consider my future here if I'm forever dealing with major weather events causing multi day power outages every 2-3 months to live here
"I hate that a few people commented on an article years ago and I have to hear, ""DID KATY EVACUATE YET?"" for the rest of my life."
"Strongest winds should be passing through Houston within and for the next 4-6 hours, then start to taper off. 

The bayou and water channels seem to be holding up well for now. At least 10 more hours of heavy rain to go."
"77011.

I tidied up the yard/put stuff away, did the grocery shopping yesterday, and helped my parents tidy up their yard & put stuff away. Usual tropical storm stuff.

I’ve been telling people who have asked me what to do: plan to finish up anything that requires driving before about 3pm, and then just plan on staying home. We don’t need Harvey or Allison levels of rain for the roads to turn into a shitshow, so why chance it?"
"https://www.harriscountyfws.org/


This is good if you need to monitor water levels in the channels near your house"
"I should clean out my gutters, thanks for the reminder"
"77433. My first hurricane as an adult in Houston so not sure what to expect. 

Wasn’t living here for Harvey and evacuated for Ike and Rita as a kid. Did experience TS Allison fwiw and that was traumatic as a child to say the least haha 

I’ve got water and snacks so I guess at least it’s a cat 1 (or  less hopefully) so I can see how I fare and adjust accordingly for the future. I’m in an apartment so no generator but I have begun looking into portable power stations 

Stay safe everyone"
"channelview area. compared to the huge storm in may how bad will it hit us? with the last storm we lost power for 4 days

 also starting to feel heavy winds and rain. not sure if this is the bands of beryl, or just another storm."
"HEB in Bellaire had plenty of dry ice, regular ice, bottled water, and food 90 minutes ago."
"77073 1960 & 45
Just had heavy rain for about 10 minutes and now it's sprinkling but I can hear some thunder."
77384- went from sunny and hot to dark and raining real quick.
77345. can’t confirm for android but the weather app on iOS has a precipitation map view that allows you to zoom into neighborhood level and see where the hurricane is relatively located.
"77025 Calm, but we've just been given a tornado watch."
I’m seeing posts about it now being a direct hit for Houston. Any truth to this?
77380. Stress eating while waiting for what's to come. 😅
77098 - steady but light rain. Cool wind picking up a little. Grayish night sky.
77479 got first power flicker. The eye is projected to pass over our home as a cat 1 now
"77091. Light, steady rain here. Nothing crazy yet and I hope it stays that way.."
"77025. Took dogs for a last walk before the red stuff gets here. Pretty quiet with light rain, but a warm slow wind blowing in. Going back to bed for a few hours to see what the morning brings."
"77532 scattered rain still, and a few gusts. Wondering if I can catch a nap for a bit."
"77441. Power lost about 15 minutes ago. Doesn’t feel/sound too bad outside right now, though."
77058 transformer blew at 4:27 no word on repair
"77084. Transformers blowing close by. Powers flickering, going out soon for sure. Wind and rain is picking up. Matches the radar bands. Mildly excited to maybe experience a eye of a hurricane"
77008 power just flickered twice...
77007 power flickered off and back on.
"77025 Willow Bend. Power has winked and blinked a few times just now. And then I thought I lost it, but it came back after a few beats. 

 After that last power surge, my air conditioner, central air unit right outside my first floor window, began making a rattling and humming noise and now it's not cooling even though it's on."
77459 I really expect to find at least one of my home security cameras blown off my house by the time this passes. I can't recall experiencing wind like this right in my area before. 
"77062, no power, transformers going left and right."
"77450 - UPS's are working overtime as the power has started flickering off and on a few times, so I'm hurrying up and taking the browns to the Superbowl now and not later while there's still time.

I'm eyeballing the local HCFWS gauge for the Mason Creek that runs through and it's shot way the hell up. [5 feet in last hour](https://www.harriscountyfws.org/GageDetail/Index/2020?From=7/8/2024%205:45%20AM&span=24%20Hours&r=1&v=surfaceBox&selIdx=0) has me very concerned for the morning.

Edit great, Comcrap just went out for a bit."
"77034. We have power but it’s not the most stable. Hoping it stays on, we’ve got a leaking window that we’re having to use a shop-vac on to keep it from flooding our bedroom.


Edit: power out at 6:41"
77007 power out
"77084 - after a placid night, we just lost power 5 minutes ago
Everything looks fine outside. Rain and wind but the street and area looks fine"
77459 With the sun it I can see my shared fence with my backyard neighbor has fallen over. Not looking forward to having the conversation about who is responsible for fixing it. 
77429 just lost power 10 min ago
"77098 upper Kirby

Lights have flickered but we have kept power. However our apartment is filled with water so that’s a nightmare. "
"77539 - slept for the past 3 hours, woke up to power still existent. I think I’m close enough to UTMB League City’s power grid that this is the miracle keeping things on.    

Nonetheless, it’s still gusting and raining sideways. Beryl was declared as a cat 1 but some wind speeds near landfall were nearly cat 2. She’s also not moving on as fast as we thought she would and has shifted eastward AGAIN making her path right through Houston. If you look at radar forecasts (Accuweather’s here https://www.accuweather.com/en/us/league-city/77573/weather-radar/340890 ), they actually have her somewhat spinning in place after this first wave is gone? Around 9:15 you can see it looks like a new eye just reforms around Bay City?!"
77429 - no power here! I saw someone recommend if you still have power to lower the temperature of your fridge and freezer so you get a bit more time out of them!
77006 midtown currently no power and had been flickering on and off for the last couple hours 
77493 Katy. Lost power before 7 and cell service is spotty
77002 - live in downtown and still have power thankfully
"77007 right next to downtown, I suffered a lot of damages from the derecho but no additional damages so far from beryl and everything seems pretty fine for the time being.

11:18 edit, still in the storm bit gusting is getting pretty crazy, some water started dripping from my hvac/ac areas saw some humidity forming in the attic but nothing looks like its leaking leaking.  Some water damage occured around the vent in the ceiling of my home office/bedroom 3 of my place."
"77004 in midtown

power went out twice and came back. 

Heard a loud pop, I fear it was a transformer that went off. Power is now gone"
[deleted]
77007 East of TC Jester. Had power in and out about a dozen times over the last hour but it seems to be out for good now.
"Sorry to sound stupid - first time renter on the second floor, how in the world is my roof leaking if I’m on the second floor? Genuine question!"
77004 - are things easing up or is it my wishful thinking? I’m so anxious I have a headache and the runs so may not be realistic.
"I have frozen water bottles in my freezer. Should I throw them in my Yeti cooler with my food or leave everything in the fridge? It's not much, just fruit and veggies."
Welp the street is almost completely flooded  77011
"Think the back side of the storm has come, 77077"
"77018 no power or internet since about 6am.  

We lost water pressure around 10am.  Anyone else struggling with water, or are we a one-off? "
"77011 rain stopped but winds are still gusty, we have some power but our water is gone..."
"After living here for most of my life and experiencing every crazed weather moment, I finally narrowly missed this one as I’m traveling out of state. Can cross that off my list. I hope everyone stays safe!"
"77095, no power since midnight and it’s 1pm now. Nothing but a giant Walmart has power but overall damage isn’t too bad."
When will it be safe to drive from Montrose to Katy? My friend said I could go stay with her in Katy since she has power.
"77479 - no power. Water works. Cell service for att doesn’t work, my work Verizon does. Been without power since 2am. Trees down around my area."
"Man that first wave is a real bitch! The weatherman lied to me lol. Time said starting at 12:45 so I thought I'd get a last bike ride in before it rains all week long.

Cue me getting drenched on the sidewalk along I-10 at 12:15, a full half hour ahead of schedule. I am very very lucky that I made it the rest of the way home somehow with only getting soaked and not hit by lightning or a car on the way. It totally took me by surprise like it was dry and dark in the distance one minute and tropical storm the next."
77009 hunkered down and beer protocol is activated. Hoping for no power outages!
Kemah area. Can't sleep. Might as well play some Civilization VI to pass the time.
Morons in Katy are shopping on live TV at the Buccees.  They dont realize they are in the eye and the tail end is coming.  Wow.
"77007 here, it’s getting windy and the rain is picking up.

What is everyone doing to keep yourself busy?"
Power outages over 1.1 million now
77084 - really bending us over a beryl here
"77030

I've been in Houston for barely a month. This will be my first hurricane and I'm really scared. I did pack a hurricane kit and emergency supplies, etc, but I'm still going to be alone in facing the storm. Hopefully nothing too significant will happen and I wish us to stay safe and good luck!"
"Galveston upgrade to hurricane warning

More than likely due to a east wobble of the center of circulation 

Looking like a Freeport landfall possibly 

If so Hurricane force winds are guaranteed for Houston"
77027 - Didn't know this was a serious thing LOL I just drove back from Little Rock a few hours ago. Got a day's worth of food from takeout leftovers and filled some pots with water. The more I learn. First tropical storm for me in Houston (from MA).
Westside. Power is out already. Here we go again
77389.  Just woke up. Slight wind and rain. Just lowered the AC to 68 to cool the house down for the power outage that is sure to happen shortly. Debating watching porn.
people were saying the winds will not be crazier than than derecho but man these are bad
Centerpoint says 1.1 million without power currently.
"A lot of my neighbors still have tarps on their roofs from the last catastrophic weather event. I remember one I told I was looking to get transferred to another state. His response was ""why would you leave Houston?"".

Huh"
"11 high voltage transmission lines are reported to have fallen down.    
This was gusts under 100 mph, so pathetic. They all must be rusted out.  Centerpoint needs to be fired."
77027. Moving vehicles to higher ground (garage) with full tank gas. Stocked up on some food/MREs. Cash on hand. Four battery banks charged up. No generator
"77063 heavy rain for the past hour, thunder. HISD is closed tomorrow and Tuesday."
77573-League City. We currently have a nice breeze. That's it.
"77539 League City, nice looking Sunday afternoon here. Stocked up with food, backup batteries, and full tank of gas. Work from home tomorrow. Third floor apartment and just anticipating a cozy rainy day tomorrow with some possible power outages and maybe an opportunity to catch up on sleep. "
Anyone know if metro will run tomorrow?
"77092. Rained hard for half an hour (1 p.m. -1: 30). Grey skies. Power was/is fine. 

Edit: 4: 45 p.m., raining again."
77077 5pm update. Some light rain. Not much to report at this moment. Just thinking about what to do for dinner.
"77571 - Band just moved through, second one since around noon. Dark skies, no thunder or lightning. The bands that have came through so far have carried a good bit of rain with them."
77070 rained a little now totally quiet.
Hopefully communication stays up
"Anyone know if it's making landfall as cat 1 or 2? I thought it would be cat 1, but some people on Twitter are saying cat 2. I'm hoping real hard it's cat 1."
"77063 - rain is picking up fast, the wind is coming on strong, but still have power for now"
Getting ready for work as usual and can hear the wind pick up from the toilet
"77061 Next to Hobby. Flickering Power/Lights, news antenna signal going on and off."
"77479 Sugar Land. Heavy wind and rain, power still on. Wind pushed rain under the threshold of my back door and under the LVP so it's squishy when I walk."
77018 just lost power
77008 Lazybrook. Power out now.
"77013. Heavy wind and rain. 

Intermittent power outage in this area. 

Winds intensifying. 

Power loss expected. 

Be safe out there, everyone.


Update: power loss about one hour ago. 

Centerpoint sent a text about restoration expected time frame of 8: 15 am. 

Think they have to wait until the storm passes to get started. 

Thinking more like end of day."
"77035 Willow meadows - power has flickered several times, but all is well over here otherwise"

"77016 Scenic Woods. More heavy gusts, and the rain has picked up substantially. Nothing crazy yet. Power hasn't flickered, and my flood prone street is still looking good."
77042. No power for around the last hour and one of my bedroom windows turned into a faucet so that's been fun
77459 power is gone gone. What makes this wind so crazy is that the gusts are sustained for so long. My whole house is creaking.

Wow damn.  Power is flickering at 77034.

"77493 Katy- Franz/99 area

Power still on for now, but flickered just a minute ago. Wind is batshit. Rain is heavy. My poor dogs haven't been able to go outside to go pee (one of them always takes a dump right after he eats, too)."
77489 near the Ft. Bend Toll about 5:30ish. Power was off and on for about 10 minutes till it finally gave up. Great time to find a few minor leaks 😭

"77057 Don’t want to jinx it, but my power is still on. A couple of pretty quick off-ons in the post couple of hours so who knows."
77536 Deer Park -- lost power around 5:40 am. Nothing major otherwise. Hopefully that is all until this storm moves on through. Sounds like the worst will be over at around lunch for my area.
77429 just lost power few mins ago was fighting to stay on but gave up after few flickers
"77070


No power as of 6am. Probably going to wait to go to work until later. "

77079 - anyone know how they're doing? I'm out of the country but I have someone cat sitting for me.  I hate not knowing what is going on.
"I see a big branch that’s sitting precariously after breaking off on my neighbor’s lot. Their house is abandoned, I’ve never met them but their info is probably on hcad. Who/how do I contact? Thinking about sending a certified mail"
055 I'm afraid to mention the power situation and jinxing it 🤐
"77433 is without power for the last hour or so. That portable generator, shed, natural gas connection and power inlet I just finished with yesterday are coming in clutch!"
"I am dumb and thought my generator would run in the rain like an atv or motorcycle, it cannot.  Does anyone have an opinion on it f a temporary/ make shift tent with a 18' pool cover and some landscaping posts will work.  Going to ventilate each end and sides for quality airflow but can keep it away from the house.

Edit: Upon more research my refrigerator and freezer should be fine until I can run the generator around 1 after the second phase of the storm (in Richmond).  At least this gave me something to do to pass the time."
77030 no power since 7am. I can see the hospitals from my house but I just barely am outside the grid sadly. Does anyone know when you usually lose water in a hurricane? This is my first time really
"Where in houston still has power? I just came hkme from work in the medical center. No power outage I don't think they have the backup generator on. Drove 10 min home, my side of town is out of power. My lease is up soon, thinking about moving  closer to medical center to prevent power outage"
Anyone else lose water too? Out close to i10 in Katy and seems like it's out in the last hour
"East end, power just went out about 20min ago"
"77008. Heights & 13th

Finally lost power after flickering lights for a while. Been iff for a good 15 mins now."
Does anyone know why our toilets aren’t flushing in our house? Sorry if a dumb question. First hurricane as a homeowner so unsure if that is normal.
77095 and it’s clearing up quite a bit now. Seems like we’re in the eye?
We're out of power and our unit is full of water leaks
"77584 - Pearland, west of SH288. Power went out about 6AM. We’re out of town but ‘monitoring’ via our Nest doorbell."
77060 Aldine area no power since 7 am
"Well, I jinxed it. 055 here. Neighborhood still powered up, but a tree just fell and took out my line to the house and pulled it out if my meter. Guessing I have to sort out the tree first before Centerpoint will fix it?"
77459 Cell coverage has been spotty with T-Mobile. Anyone know if it'd be safe to get to the Med Center now? Trying to decide if I want to go in to work to save half a day of PTO. 
"77030, right at the med center. No power since 9. Typically don’t loose it during storms. Hope it’s back soon. Very calm weather now. Projected to rain again in an hour then till 3pm. Bayou pretty flooded."
Power on in 77008. Lost it for about a minute an hour ago.
No power in 77571. Been that way since 5 or 6 this morning.
"77071 again. I feel like the absolute worst of it might be over? There’s still an occasional powerful gust and I *think* a tree by my window is damaged (not enough to impact the house) but it’s not as bad as it was four or five hours ago. 

Out of curiosity, how’s power at 77042? My workplace is in that area and we’re closed until Wednesdays anyways but I’m just a bit concerned."
Anyone else struggling with cell service around XXXXX?
77099 area - can anyone report in from how it's looking looking by you in the Southwest Houston/Alief area?
"77014 update

Still no power and about 40 minutes ago, we lost cell signal -T-mobile

We will get a bar here or there, but there is no real signal.


For those that have a generator or battery backup, if you power your router and modem, there is a good chance you will regain wifi again."
77054 no power
Any news for 77546 - Friendswood? My sister is in labor at HCA Houston Clear Lake and we want to know if their house is okay.
Is the centerpoint map down? (I saw it this morning and can’t find it again)
"I knew it was going to be bad when I looked at the NWS hurricane page for flash flooding this morning and saw this:

[NWS flash flooding potential ](https://i.imgur.com/BLFvgjd.jpeg)"
77089 - Lost power at 5am and just got it back on.
I can’t Beyrll these dang hurricane puns.

" 77036 Sharpstown, just lost power and the wind isn't even blowing hard yet. 

 &nbsp;

Fuk.."
"77007 - Wind starting to pick up, still drizzling rain wise"
They're saying it makes landfall as a TS now?
ABC 13 is wild right now. first car watch and now no power.
"77004 Power out since 5:30.  Heard a loud boom outside that could have been a transformer going or just something heavy getting blown around. Time to make Centerpoint a utility again and fark ""duty to the shareholders"" bs. Modernize the grid and bury the lines."
"Full tank of gas in car. Got all my devices and backup batteries fully charged. Got my solar powered fans ready to go. Bathtubs filled with water. Movies and shows downloaded to my tablet for offline viewing.

Nothing else to really do at this point except wait. I really hope the power holds. This neighborhood held during the derecho."
"77450 power was out for a couple hours. Back on now thank you Jesus, it was getting so hot and stuffy. Rained lightly for a bit then let up, a little thunder. "
"77406, nothing happening right now weather wise, but the latest AccuWeather forecast now has the path tilted so far that a storm that's been coming in from the west is now projected to go (very slightly) east of me.

So the only way we are avoiding anything here is if it continues to aim towards Houston."
Can’t wait to wake up to an email saying I need to come into work in-person when there’s major flooding!
"77571, La Porte -- Winds are picking up with 30 mph wind gusts. I am pulling an all-nighter watching this storm. Haven't lost power yet."
Does anyone know what time the storm will “be over” ? Pass downtown?
77009 so far so good. Only concern is that Since the Derecho rain has caused yard and drainage ditches to flood (never been issue last 5 years). Wonder if we still have some storm debris backing things up.
"77084. sitting in the eye of the hurricane. Its calm. no rain, no wind. went and took my trash out and take in the once in a lifetime experience. i watched storm chasers try and get it at the coast last night. and im just here"
Is the rain forecasted for today not associated with Beryl? I’m confused as to when it’s actually going to hit us
"My family thinks its a good idea to get a car out of hobby in the morning in case we need to leave town, but im not sure if that's a good idea, any thoughts? I figured if we wanted to leave we should have done so already."
"Just got hit by the first band in humble

The winds went from zero to about 40mph very quickly before dying down"
77449 Katy by Mason Road.  Coming down hard now
77058 been sprinkling on and off but it's sunny right now. UHCL hasn't decided if they're going to be open or closed tomorrow.
Any good bayou cams or live streams?
77449  and the carburetor on my generator needs to be cleaned 🥺as of rn it’s not raining
What's the best way to check street/road flooding in the morning?

77546 there goes the power.
77346 Atascocita. Was standing outside as a gust came through and heard a transformer and watched all the street lights/houses go out around me. Came right back on though. Kind of surprised since I am pretty far NE.
"77339, just lost power NE houston :("
77498 power gone
77069 no power

[deleted]
77007 - My power was out for 30 minutes around an hour ago and now it has been on and off since. I'm watching Khou live and Hidalgo mentioned the worse is yet to come for Harris so brace for the next 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
When is it projected to be safe to go outside? Noonish?
"Gusts getting scary in Westbury. 
Been awake since 5 and this is as bad as they’ve been. 

Holy Moly y’all"
"77450 again, power is still out since 6:30. Winds got a bit quiet just now I think the eye is about to pass through. Houston public media has been keeping me entertained on the crank radio but I'm too chicken to call in like I want to so I'm gonna post on here instead 😂

Work finally called it thankfully, we're closed today so I'm staying home. I tossed on a raincoat and headlamp and some gear and did a quick 5 minute walk around the apartment just to check damage but didn't venture too far. Mason Creek is flowing fast AF like a raging white water rapid river, I would not want to be out in that. One of the carport roofs took some damage, as did some gutters as did a section of apartment exterior on the neighbor's that looks like insulation is exposed. Headlamp came in handy as it's completely black in the hallway, water on concrete and trash cans blown everywhere and a few exit signs torn apart from the wind tunnel effect. Apartment has taken some wet spots on the ceiling, i put buckets underneath to be safe y'all can also use trash cans storage bins whatever as needed. Temp gun shows its already 78 inside so it's gonna be fuuuuun if it doesn't kick on soon (and based on 1m+ without power rn it likely will be). Trying to decide if i want to bug out to folks later or not when the storm clears."
[deleted]
a few windows in our rental were poorly sealed and there is a crack along the top where window meets wall that is now essentially raining into our house … does anyone have any solutions to stop the water from spreading beyond towels? 
"77025, wind is wild. 500000 power hits. The first time I got scared was when water came through the front door in the dark. I keep hearing shit hit my windows. Going to put vodka in my red bull and pray."
"77365 Porter, north of Kingwood. No power since 7 a.m. I heard a tree is blocking Sorters Rd and may be the reason for the power outage. A lot of wind, some rain. Mostly wind."
"77093 the winds are crazy right now, when are the hard winds gonna stop over here? Im fine with rain but these wind gusts are frightening. No power since 4am."
77006 - just lost power.
What's the situation in Sugar Land? Specifically zip 77478.
"77573, I swear some of the gusts now are the worst yet."
77012 Magnolia Park: Lost power just as I finished cooking migas at 9:30ish.
77027 lost power an hour ago. Transformers exploding left and right
"77007 - Power has been flickering for the last hour or so, but it’s on right now. The wind and rain got crazy but things have died down in the last 10 minutes."
"77433 no running water in my apartment now, no power either"
77014 and we haven’t had power since like 3am 😩
"77002, no power outages. The wind is intense, seems to be settling a bit."
"77006 - power flickered a few times around 9 but has remained strong. somehow i’ve gotten lucky because surrounding parts of the neighborhood (some of which are just three blocks away) are all out. i’m on a power grid with a school nearby, unsure if that has anything to do with it"
"77006 - power went off and on about 5 times, finally came back on around 9:15am."
77083. Wind and rain is picking up again. 
77380. We lost power but haven't sustained any damage. It looks like the wind is dying down a bit?  I hope that means that maybe we're through the worst of it.
77025 power just went out
"77070


A ton of wind now and heard it got downgrades to a tropical storm. "
"77356 here.  The storm seems to have passed.  The generac is doing it's job and the yard is a mess, but overall we came through it in good shape."
"I know generators need regular maintenance, but we have one from the ice storm that hasn’t been used since, mostly bc we’re not handy and just overall unfamiliar with mechanics, and thankfully have not needed it since. Is it a total loss having been unused or not maintained for 3 years or does it stand a chance to be serviced and brought back to life?

Our power came back thankfully but this is just the beginning of a long hurricane season."
"77043


There's a power truck at kempwood and manila!"
Maybe a dumb question but any way to get to Dallas? Looks like we could take 610 to 45 but there’s flooding at West rd. We have a baby who needs medical treatments and our backup power has failed
Any information on East end or second ward?
77025. 4:30 pm. Finally dug my camping stove powered by (butane cans) out of the closet. Have just had my first cup of coffee of the day. My God it feels good.
"77459 

Went to manvel heb and left with a panic attack. 

Husband is being forced to work at the smoke shop tomorrow"
77024 near Memorial City Mall. We had the big band of rain. We brought in the lawn furniture. Later we will bring in the trash cans to the garage. I am doing laundry and cooking. The hubby is at the gym. He already did the tp run!  Meanwhile my daughter has scoped out the safe places in case there is a tornado.
"Spring, 45 and 1960. What we expecting neighbors?"
Don’t watch the news hype
[deleted]
Was able to peel my ass outta bed where I've been with a stomach bug for 3 days.  The grass doesnt mow it's own self.  775OhShit
[deleted]
"When are we thinking tornado warnings might start? When the wind/rain starts around midnight? 

Trying to figure out how much sleep I will actually get tonight lol"
Would you sleep on the second story during just a tornado watch or would you move to the first floor just in case?
"Heads up, the eye is forming a [""train""](https://imgur.com/a/NhbG5TD) of heavy rain to fall over Houston for the next while. Be prepared for flooding"
Daycare and camps are closed. Guess it's another unproductive weather day in Houston.
77007 we lost internet for about 5 hrs last night. Oddly a few hours AFTER the rain stopped.

"77095, 77433; Barker Cypress. Raining and wind picking up a bit, but nothing extreme."

He also mentioned that the BARC animal shelter's generator isn't working."
"77008

Just going to bring the garbage cans in. It's annoying to empty them of water every time they get blown on their sides. Don't think this will be too bad for us. Some gusty winds on Monday and 4-6 inches of rain but we've had worse this year."
77494 - where this mf at ? I’m ready. Hope my power goes out so I don’t have to get up and work
77445-locking it down
I have an apartment in lower heights (studemont/washington). Family lives in the woodlands and Woodforest. Where would I be better off for the storm?
"77377 Tomball- we put the umbrellas down outside. H-E-B was kinda dead yesterday morning.didnt look like too many were prepping, just normal shopping."
77478 is my area code. I am out of town and currently scheduled to fly into IAH Sunday night. How bad is it there? Should I change my flight?
"77092, Nina Lee and Antoine, just lost power about 10 minutes ago."

border of 77025 and 77030: finally lost power about 5 minutes ago

Any word on what it looks like on navigation? Are there downed power lines like before

"If you are driving and see debris in the road, please get out and move it if it is safe to do so. I stopped three times to do this on my way from Westheimer and Shepard to i10. People were stopping traffic but no one had bothered to move stuff like orange construction barrels."

"77539 League City, rain starting :)"
No rain over where I’m at yet. I’m guessing it should be starting soon
77573 league city- drizzling
77008. Timbergrove power flicked off and now back on. 🤞
77459 MO City - power has flickered but is still on.  Sounds like my house is getting a nice power washing.
Hoping everyone stays safe out there from NC.
77450. On & Off for 10 minutes. Finally settled in Off. Behind Rudy's off I10/Mason.
77006 in montrose - no power.
"Anyone know if Centerpoint will send out info on when they'll restore power to which areas?
I followed this webpage to find out but I got nothing:


https://cnp.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=dc78873425a04b929a30ce2461fd0097"
Very eastern edge of 77025. Lost power around 6:30 this morning. Still out. We are close to several medical facilities. I am hoping that will prompt Centerpoint to get power to our area sooner rather than later.
"77459 again

We have an 8 month old baby and my brother In law who stays with us has a 3 month old baby. 

Since we are in the sugarland area, should we rough it out or would it be safer to leave the area"
"Most recent HRRR run is aligned with the GFS with a [landfall close to Sargent](https://imgur.com/a/YPaOlkk).

Projected as a category 1 but some models are holding on to the possibility of RI to a category 2."
"77450 is my area code. This is my first hurricane since moving here. I have family that live up north, should I evacuate with my kids? We have a very large pine tree that is right by me and my children’s bedrooms. A little concerned about the wind gusts potentially knocking it over and smashing the house. But I have no experience with this so please any advice is appreciated. 

Edit: thank you all for your helpful responses! I sent my kids with my family back to their house up north (they happened to be here for the 4th of july weekend) and I’m staying back with my husband to prep our house for the storm. Im going to move a mattress to our dining room to sleep on, the farthest possible place from the massive pine in front of our house, and hope and pray for the best. My husband and I can always drive up this afternoon if we have a change in heart, assuming there is no raging rain. "
77096 Westbury - Wind is starting to pick up. No murders plotted because I get to work from home tomorrow (assuming I have power/internet).
Anyone know how Third Ward by TSU usually fairs in these storms?
"77092.  Quick downpour, some wind., and lots of lightning ⚡️ ."
77583 Lots of rain and lightning past hour. It’s gotten pretty quiet now but I can see dark clouds out there.

77036 There's something shorting out in the direction of the mall. It's big whatever it was.
77012 just lost power. These winds aren’t even as bad so I assume something else caused this.
"My camera is offline, 77054 is down :("
"77406- wind has been constant, rain has been a little more intermittent but has been stronger recently.  Power has been flickering a bit, lost it for 10-20 seconds then it came back"

77094 power in and out
anyone in 77054/near nrg? im working near jersey village and wondering how the flooding is right now
"77346, lost power an hour ago"
"77022 nawfside (crosstimbers Fulton), power been out since about 5:30 to 6:00. High winds and crosstimbers is flooded"

77389 - power has been flickering since about 6:30 this morning
77057 lights out at 7:39. Honestly surprised we lasted this long

"77055 had power around 6 am went back to sleep, gone now"
77066 power has been out since 5:30 am. Steady rain with wind gusts that drive rain sideways for the past couple of hours.
77006 lost power some time in the night
Anyone near 77079 have power? I have family over there that won't answer.
"77018.  Looks like I lost power around 7 AM.

77505.  Power has been up and down.  Now down for a good ten minutes."
77389 - so far power flickers but nothing super crazy. I’m fearing that this is just a taste of what’s to come. Super cooling the house just in case
77043 just lost power
77401 without power for about 45 min now.
"77354 in Magnolia/The Woodlands - Power has flickered a few times but still have it. 

Looking at the radar it seems like the eye might pass right over me, is that correct?"
"77064, power finally went out."
Any updates from Humble? 77396? Im out of town
77058 power was constantly going out due to transformer tripping from 2-4am then finally off for good. Generator is currently keeping my koi and food in the fridge alive. Backyard fence is toast.
"77080 

Power went out at 6:30. Heard the transformer blow. Luckily the derecho took care of most of the old trees along the power lines, so I'm hoping this outage will be over quicker than the last one"
"My gazebo is not 100% anchored, we have large stakes in the ground and heavy stones and sand on top of the bases. It's pretty large and heavy (the whole thing is steel), just hope it doesn't fly away."
"77493 never lost power, holding it down. Winds crazy speed."
Anyone have a good guesstimate as to how long a fridge will stay cold without power? 
77096 Just lost power. Hope Braes Bayou holds. Doesn’t look very promising from apt garage.
[IT'S THE WONDER OF NATURE BABY!](https://youtu.be/ok1M29-et0k?si=qOzIXsMhxLhAMckl)
"77016 Scenic Woods. Lost power around 9:15. Has not been restored. Wind gusts seem less than earlier. Street flooded, but not as bad as I've seen from flash floods or Harvey."
"77316, near Lake Conroe. Power finally went out around 9:30AM. Heavy rain and winds. Bad but not too bad. Good luck to those who are getting it bad."
77056 is it over now?
77024. No power since 6:00AM. Lost a big oak tree in the backyard but fortunately not on the house. 8” rain gauge was overflowing at 7:00AM and we have another 3+ inches in it since I emptied it. Stay safe out there!
77598 I think another hour or so of rain and I'd be standing in water in my 1st floor apartment.
77018 just lost power about 20 min ago
"77061 near Hobby power out since 8am. Thankfully no major damage, but lost our fence and have one scared pup."
Anyone in 77377?  Can’t get ahold of my parents.  Guessing cell service is down?
77493 - Many people nearby are without power but select neighborhoods haven't had any loss.
[deleted]
77087 no power
77070. Our power flickered on for like 2 seconds then back off it went 
"I have to make it to Dallas tonight, though giving it some time before I leave. I can either go 45 all the way up, or 290 to 6 to 35 (through College Station and Waco), both are easily accessible from here. Anyone have any insight on those highways right now?

Edit- will add I'm not leaving until the storm has fully passed on either route."
"77004, power went out around 830 am, still out. Hoping it comes on by the end of the day"
77459 Anyone know how the roads are in to the Med center? I'd like to go check on my place there but worried about water and debris. 
"KHOU says Addicks and Barker reservoirs are ""fine"", and the Corps is releasing some water into Buffalo Bayou but it's not expected to cause any additional flooding."
"77022 past the tracks, near Tampico got lights around 5p on Fri. Thank God."
[deleted]
"Eastwood area is quiet right now after a band of rain from maybe slightly less than hr or so ago.

Water for us is all prepped (tub and 3x 5-gal containers) gonna do some cooking later this afternoon"
"77002

Downtown Houston. It stormed earlier. Power never waivered. Streets clear. Sunny outside at 4pm."
https://www.youtube.com/live/RzXhj3BLPJ8
"TMC/Astrodome area, definitely hearing the wind gusts outside. Flashbacks to Ike. Ah well not exactly yet, but.. ugh its still scary."
Will my flight coming into Houston around 8am tomorrow be canceled?
"Hello everyone.  I hope this is the correct place to post this.  I am traveling with family and was supposed to stay in Houston tonight.  The hotel is not responding, a Home2 suite next to the galleria.  Is that area still open?  Should I be looking to pass through Houston instead?

Any info is helpful as we are on the road and blind currently."
77080 wind just started picking up. still light rain. no power outage in my neighborhood yet but I reckon that'll change when the gusts get stronger
"77057 - no power, but my centerpoint account is saying ""power on""... what did that mean? It clearly isn't. "
"77007. Power out around 5am, coming back intermittently now. Hoping it comes back as soon as the storm heads out."
"77056 fingers crossed but if I make it through the storm without losing power then it will be 4 years here not ever once having an unplanned power outage.

 I live in an apartment complex and even my neighbors have lost power in previous storms but I have never. Not sure why that is, but hoping it all holds up"
"Update from [77449...](https://old.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dxf6si/beryl_megathread_the_cooper_knocks/lc6jcno/)

7 hours later, power's still out, but the storm seems to be done here.  Nothing except a garbage can fell over, a table that was on it's side (I put it like that) was on it's top, and then a VERY heavy closed umbrella and stand *moved a foot to the north and wound up on top of that table.*

o.0

Some wind...

Anyway, lucky, we're all good here, now, thanks... how are you?

You're sending a squad up?  Well, I won't blast the comm panel if you make the power work...

Anyway, generator is now up and running on propane.  We would have had it on natural gas, but apparently it's not flowing enough now to run it.  It tried to start, I can smell it in the exhaust (and boy did it have a nice *BANG* in the muffler when the propane started up, that was fun.), so... yeah.  There's that.  

Got about 2 or maybe 3 hours then I gotta swap tanks... then I got another maybe 2 hours.

Hope they get the natural gas goin'... or power, either will do.

Once again, good dang luck to everyone, and I hope y'all did ok."
"Hey all I’m currently out of state and have a flight Tuesday afternoon- I’ve been tracking the best I can and flight hasn’t been cancelled yet, but from what you guys see it’s on the ground is the damage being done going to keep roads closed / flooding / etc to be able to drive around / have a flight land? 

I know it’s speculation at this point, but just curious. 

TIA"
"77055, is it worth heading further into town for the night/tomorrow?"

"77095
Both cars full of gas,l on Friday.
Gas cans and generator ready since the derecho 
Cleaned the gutter on the first floor today
Cleaned up the yard today
Trash can is full, so it stays out, plenty heavy
I think I have Covid so I am going to sleep"

"77070.


Some light rain and wind for now. Watching the live feed and it looks wild. "
"77546 lots of wind and rain. Power still holding, 2 window leaks 🥲"
77053. Just lost power.
77532 Lickskillet checking in. So the wind is kicking up now. I guess I'm not getting any sleep till the other side of the eye passes.
77459 power out
"77584 - Still have power with wind gusts up to 20mph, 4 inches of rain so far, and one downed tree branch. It’s definitely wild so far and there is still quite a bit more to come."
"77055, Westview and Antione. Power went out at 6:12am. God I hope it doesn't turn off the whole city again."
[removed]
[removed]
"77423 - after having a few power flickers over the past hour and a half, it finally went out about 15 minutes ago. Watching the radar, it looks like the eye will track either right over us or a bit east."
Anyone in the 77083 area code able to tell me if there's power right now? 
77057 lights have been holding strong but finally flickered off and on at 6:42
77036 power down since 6:10 AM
Power flashed here in 77375 but it’s still holding on surprisingly
77048 and we’ve still got power. Stay safe.
77031 - power just went out.
77088 - Lost power around 5:30am

77385 lost power about 25 minutes ago
77365 lost power around 6:30am.
"Anyone know how 77098, West Alabama/Kirby area is? Had to go into work (essential worker) and worried about flooding/the cat. My windows were leaking a bit but I was able to stack some towels up."
"77055, power’s been out since 8:19 am "
"77093 the winds are crazy right now, when are the hard winds gonna stop over here? Im fine with rain but these wind gusts are frightening. No power since 4am."
77379. Power is still on but keeps flickering. Some of the breakers flipped so I don't have power in certain rooms. At least AC is still working.
77354 without power since about 630 am 🥳.
77459 We've now lost water pressure as well. Wind and rain seems to be dying down though. 
"77055. Power has been off since 6:20 this morning. About 30 minutes ago the power came on and got cut off in short intervals. Each time it cut off I heard a loud transformer buzz outside. It's still off now but I hope they're working on it.

On the Centerpoint Outage Tracker, does anyone know what the difference / clarification is between 'Customers affected' (currently at 2.2mil) and 'Active outages' is?"
Does the hobby area have power? Thinking of renting a car at the Avis.
"77095,77433; Barker Cypress as boundary between Tuckerton and Cypress North Houston. Power back about an hour ago. Just got back from driving around charging devices. Hope everyone else’s comes back quickly."
Is the power back in 77054?
77061 near Hobby- power just restored!
Anyone know where it's not affected by a power outage at all? I'm thinking of driving out of Houston to stay in a hotel.
"77042 near beltway 8 and westheimer. lost power 6am Monday and still don’t have it. 

Does anyone know where I can find a timeline? I read somewhere that they would have one by noon today but didn’t see one other than numbers, but I want to know when my neighborhood will get power back.

I saw that Centerpoint said they’ll have 400,000 more up by Friday night and 350,000 more up by Sunday. What about everyone else? Who knows?"
"The wind is dying down over the metro but it is NOT OVER!  This is the eye, the backside is coming.  It won’t have near the rain and the wind won’t be as strong, but it’ll be still pretty strong.  The problem is, the wind will be coming from a different direction, there will be more damage."
"77018. No power. 

Any liquor stores gonna be open in the area?"
"77502. Power has been flickering for the last hour. Every time I think this is it, it comes back on. Been storming and windy af too."
Power been flickering last 20 minutes. My PSUs keep clicking on and off. 100% buying a generator this month. This kind of weather is only going to become more common.
"77018. Power out around 4/5am, and found two leaks coming through light fixtures. 😔 "
"77043 

Still have power. It’s intense outside though. Surprised we are still up and running. Working from home today."
77389. Any ideas on how to anchor my gazebo down a bit harder? It's swaying a lot in this wind.
I know it's dangerous but does anyone know the damage situation around 2nd ward/ East end from what I see it's mostly down branches but not as much damage like during the derecho
"I have a flight out of IAH tomorrow, Monday, at 4:20pm. Should I move it earlier or to Tuesday?"
Is it still considered a hurricane? It looks like it's not gonna exceed mid 40s around here? Man I wish I could just knock myself out and sleep through it lol
[deleted]
About 3 hours out on a hot flight from Amsterdam. So you’re saying there’s a storm or something?
Cypress is overall the best place to be in Houston.
[deleted]
Is this the end?
"LOL Hildago showed up to work today to showboat on the news. I guess it is not a mental breakdown day while making $200K a year, such a hard life.  She is just as bad a ted cruz for not showing up to work.  
I say this as a disappointed liberal democrat.  Her conduct has been pathetic."
This storm was underwhelming . I expected a little chaos and all there was wind and rain for like 1.5 - 2 hours . Am I crazy? 
Things are good in San Antonio. So glad we left
"I may be Houston strong. But, I’m Houston angry also."
"No, the storm didn't break us. It's never \*just\* the storms.  

The infrastructure failed us. Our leaders failed us. Corporations putting profits over people failed us. This state's government continues to fail us and harm us. 

I will never judge anyone for leaving when it has become increasingly detrimental to every aspect of our quality of life to continue to stay here. If you can leave, godspeed, I hope you find a place that actually wants you to thrive there."
"It did something to me. 8 days without power is a serious low. I even live in a pricey neighborhood in Rice Village. Politics are so divisive, people can't even agree that the TX power grid needs regulation to prevent a Cat 1 storm from knocking the 4th largest city in the US out for over 1 week.

There was a time in day 3 where I watched a tree leaning on a power line catch on fire. CNP never came out and HFD couldnt do anything unless the fire spread to my house. CNP is so bad. Just god awful."
I'm Houston Getting Da Fuq Outta Here.
Storms in Houston are more frequent and more severe. It’s only going to get worse.
"I started planning my exit a year ago, seeking a new adventure and a change of scenery. Being without power for 4-days post Derecho and 6 post-Beryl have solidified my desire to try something new. I’m leaving at the end of the month.  

I grew up in Alief in the 80s-90s, an upbringing that taught me so much about cultural and economic diversity. I have lived all over town. There are so many things and people that make Houston special. Not sure if I’ll ever move back but I hope my friends and family who live here see improvements to infrastructure and public education among other things. Nothing but love to H-Town and all y’all who continue to hold it down."
"I'm just as tired as everyone else. I wish I could start over and leave TX but the few family members I have left are here, and that's important to me too. Texas can and should do better."
"Yep I’m considering moving out 

Maybe College Station or San Antonio"
"If anything, it exposed how terrible Houstons infrastructure really is. 

It took a storm for people to realize if things go south there’s no telling wtf is going to happen"
"For those considering moving to a different city, I made a spreadsheet the last time a thread like this came up this week.  It has a breakdown of the top 50 US Metro areas by population (Wikipedia). CoL is a generic number.  Public link:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yr4sIjde-ZflSpU-_obfGJo2sazsj6AHcADskTH-tOU/edit?usp=drivesdk"
"I considered it after the Freeze. After last year's heat streak, I made up my mind.

I'll be moving out in September."
"I was telling a coworker this morning that this whole thing feels so different. Trees still fallen over, branches and limbs down all over the place—even in the middle of major streets—with city workers not even bothering to clean em up, streetlights still out in many places, got neighbors who take great care of their yards who have just left all the debris in their yard for more than a week now…

It’s like the city is experiencing a collective moment where we are all saying, ‘Fuck it. I just don’t care anymore. I’m too fucking tired to give a shit.’"
"We’ve thought about it for a while. North Texas is generally built for tornados as compared to a swamp bowl that refuses to bury power lines, cannot prepare for emergency management - ever - and is generally full of road raging, incompetent maniacs."
"It was a Cat 1 when it hit Texas. 

THIS WAS FROM A FUCKING CAT 1. 

We’re beyond fucked with this city’s incompetence."
Moved away from Houston after the summer of 2011. No regrets. Life is better in the Chicago burbs.
Everyone will forget come election time sadly and nothing will change 😔
"Meanwhile, my husband and I are trying to make our way back to Houston from CA but seeing everything that’s been going on, definitely makes me second guess our choice a bit."
"Grew up in Houston, moved away for 10 plus years as an adult and finally excitedly moved back last summer. Excitement wore off quickly. Moving again out of state and was feeling a little guilty/bad about leaving my “hometown” again, but not anymore. Can’t wait to get the F out of Houston and Texas."
They keep blaming this on the storm and not the slow response and terrible communication from CP and the city. 
"Born and raised here in Houston and it’s hard for me to admit that I would like to live somewhere else but I can definitely confirm I have lost the interest in living here. So much stuff has been said in the past few weeks that there’s no way to deny the fact that we are getting completely fucked over and over again by the “leaders” of the state, and I wouldn’t even say leaders but more just fucked up creatures that look like humans in positions of power. I’m interested in moving to Seattle and being close enough to travel to Vancouver when I want. As soon as I am able to make those moves, I’m outta here"
"I'm tired of Houston. So tired.

I have numerous physical disabilities, including quite severe asthma, arthritis, and more. Houston's air quality is terrible, the power grid is worse, and having to endure prolonged outages in Summer Heat feels like torture.

I was born here, but I'm so done with this city... my wife and I both are. The only thing stopping us from leaving is money."
I’m here another 8-10 years until my kids are out of school and then I’m finding an alternative
"If i had the opportunity and money, I'd definitely look to leave this state. Anytime it rains now, im sitting there wondering if power will fail."
Adding a home generator that's FO SHO.
I was more than ready and looking into leaving pre-Beryl. Watching my stubborn ass parents swelter in 98 degree weather without power for almost 2 weeks straight without staying with me despite being one of the lucky few to be in a wealthy and central enough area to retain power through Beryl sealed the deal for me. Just ridiculous governance in every way. Shameful. I'm born and raised for 23 years in Houston but I am not putting my roots down in this city. State gov already had me gone but this shit specific to this city is not doable.
"I’m held up a little while here in Denver at the airport. Chatting it up with a lot of travelers today, all commiserating on the clusterfuck. When I tell them I’m from Houston, all they can talk about is Beryl, and the fact that some are still without power. Not a good look for Abbott’s “Texas Miracle.”"
"Yep, planning now to gtfo by end of the year."
My family is still angry about the storm. They’ll be living in NC with me in 2 weeks. The kids are traumatized from it.
"Honestly, not that bad of a storm but the lack of city Maintance with already dad trees and rotten power poles is what did it"
"I wish I could just pack up and move. Out of Texas preferably, but it's not that easy for many/most people unfortunately, including myself. Gotta have the initial funds, a job lined up, a job lined up that pays you a living wage for your new destination, etc. So much to take into account that many people can't just pack up and leave despite wishing they could"
Storms a nightmare. I would leave if my career wasn't here
"Lost the front of my house. Lost memories I can never replace. My husband is gone 6 months and my dog went 2 months before him and my Mom died a few months before that,the first night in this home! 
 I'm broken. I'm exhausted and no hope really. Beryl took the last of me if feels like. I survived Katrina in Nola though! 28 days no power. Brutal,but not this humid! Dew point meets humidity damn near daily. My body,my mind,  my hands and feet are all fully rebelling. At least a month more. It has caused my whole self to be unsafe...and my dog? Who is that barking mad man? I'm looking for a map to hope.Anyone seen it? I think finances pick where I stay. I rent btw."
"Not the storm, Centerpoint, and the republican response of ""Fuck Houston, they vote democrat""."
Just an observation but I have not seen a single peep about Beryl outside of Texas subs. Wonder if it’s just the election stuff or the assassination stuff or bidens current Covid-fueled Twitter rampage or any of the million other reasons I could think of but don’t want to.
"Has anyone noticed that they have stopped cutting the tree branches away from the power lines?  Who is responsible for that. By the way, Beryl broke me as well.  I spent over $2000 dollars since the derecho on a generator, outdoor extension cables, fans, gas cans, 10 gallons of gas per day and finally a portable air conditioner."
"It’s a bluff. 

People claim “they are leaving” for a myriad reasons. But never do. 

I can remember a number a people that claimed they were leaving after someone got elected. They never left. 😂"
Seriously. I’ve seen no less than 2 accidents a day in the east end. Everyone is agitated and confrontational. People are making matters worse with their piss poor attitudes. I understand and feel the anger too but we can’t let it out on each other.
Everyone should leave Texas. Take your tax dollars somewhere else.
"Ill be gone by next week. As a native Texan, it's not worth it anymore to stay."
"I’m from here, However, haven’t lived here for over a decade and have some time is regretted living elsewhere for a variety of reasons including family. This disaster has made me have little to no regrets about not living in Houston anymore. I mean, I’ve been through hurricane Ike and I didn’t hear this much outrage about no power like I’m hearing with this storm."
I only went 24hrs with no power. I'm on dialysis I had to drive an hour for delayed emergency treatment that was a fraction of my normal one. I was sick for a week. I could have died. These clinics charge about 30k a month up to double that. To Medicare and ins. Each clinic easily has 20+40 patients a day. Fresenius and DaVita are multi billion dollars companies. Per year. THERE IS NO REASON THEU CANNOT AFFORD A GENERATOR ON EACH CLINIC. oddly I'm California and Arizona all of not half have generators on them. Yeah they never need them. However in here I'm TEX-ASS in the heart of hurricane tornado country not a single clinic has them. Wonder why ?? Because the state doesn't make them. I can guarantee you patients on dialysis have died after this storm. No one will count them as a hurricane death. Just another kidney failure patient. On can live on dialysis for 15+ years easily. If you take xare if yourself and start young. 20+ is not unheard of.
"I wonder if Centerpoint cares that they are the singular reason why thousands of people want to leave Houston, a great city that deserves a decent power grid."
"A couple more storms like this one (this year) and Houston will probably be a ghost town, but weather is getting crazy everywhere you can go ."
"crawl vegetable joke act wise voiceless bedroom scale long hospital

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*"
Born and raised Houstonian. I have been living out of state since being in the military. I had the choice this year to move back. I decided against it and Beryl and the freeze are huge reasons why. I don’t want to live in uncertainty with the power grid.
"People are mad but no one here is smart enough to change who they are voting for. In the end reality makes no difference it’s a brand. Texas is Republican and the more solidified that happens the more they can fuck with us. I don’t care about sides I’m sure any party would be corrupt if they were guaranteed to win every election. 

Anybody complaining here vote Republican in the past but is now going to change? Show of hands."
We leave next May. Already setting up camp elsewhere. A blue state for sure.
"New York interviewed renters with damaged rent homes, sure easy for them to move. Lucky to have no major damage. Though each disaster has had couple thousand in repaires. Home insurance is way higher, 5,500 State Farm, another 900 for fema. Never made a claim."
"Born and raised here and I hope the majority of y’all leave.  I love y’all, but it’s just too many of y’all.  And y’all all seemed to arrive at the same time.  That many people puts a strain on everything.  If y’all all leave at the same time and tell your friends how bad it is here, maybe we’ll be able to drive all of our freeways like we used to."
I hope people leave! It’s overly crowded everywhere

Fuck Houston
"I’ll never forget back in 2017 when my Wife told me she wanted to move back to Houston. We had been living in Atlanta for 2 years and just had our first child. She wanted to be closer to Family and at the time that made all the sense in the world. 

I remember we finally came to the decision to move back in June of 2017. Neither one of us was really excited to move back but knew it would be the best decision to make with having our first child to be closer to family. 

Now I wasn’t excited to move back due to me enjoying living in the Atlanta metro. Don’t get me wrong Houston and Atlanta has some similarities. Houston’s food was much better( but I also was in better shape and we saved more money cause we didn’t eat out as much) and I did miss the diversity of Houston. I’m also Texan originally from East Texas so being away from my Family in ETX and in Houston was a bit of a bummer. But outside of those things I didn’t miss living in Houston as much as I thought I would. Matter fact the 2 times we visited when we were living in Atlanta made me regret not moving out of Houston earlier. 

I can count on one hand how many times I had to deal with flooding while living in Atlanta. When it would rain heavily they never really lasted long and you didn’t have to worry about constant flooding driving home from work. 

Also there were actual 4 seasons and summers were tolerable. For 2 years I knew how it felt to live in a big city without having a nervous breakdown due to violent weather and piss poor infrastructure. 

So by the time we told our apartments we were no longer renewing our lease and I had already put in a transfer back to Houston did I get a reminder on why I was less stressed living in Atlanta than in Houston. That reminder was Harvey. We were living in Atlanta during Hurricane Harvey but watching the madness unfold on tv. Immediately I knew we were gonna regret moving back. 

Fast forward to today and now my Wife is coming around to the idea of moving back to Atlanta. She actually wanted to move out of Houston years ago but wanted to remain in Texas. She likes DFW but I can’t do Texas anymore period."
"I felt like this after the freeze for 43 seconds, which is the amount of time it took me to discover the amount of square footage I could afford anywhere else I’d be willing to live. (spoiler: divide your sq footage by 2, and multiple the rent/mortgage by 3)

I just consider it the Houston tax. Don’t forget to factor in a few thousand in repairs and 1-2 weeks of utter despondency every couple years. Still better than owning a dilapidated shack in buttfuck, California (after the emotional pain dissipates)"
"Considered it, but Houston is my home and unless I’m forced out I’m here to stay and at least to make things better"
"I never lost power for more than a minute due to Beryl, but I’ve lived here for going on 8 years and cannot believe how fucked things are.

As a Midwest transplant, losing power for a couple days during the cold snap a few years back just blew my mind. I sat in my cold apartment thinking “Seriously? This is all the winter it takes for everything to fall to shit here?”"
Please leave too many people live here
Yeah people should totally do it.
Houston is an absolute Hell Hole and I can’t wait to leave.
I grew up in Houston and gave up on it over 20 years ago. I’ve never understood why other people stayed.
"I would like to leave.. I’ve been here for 45 years and been through bad storms and hurricanes.. What compounds how bad things get is the blatant greed and full tilt profiteering.. Compounding that is the ‘fuck your feelings’ compassion 
expressed from city and state government and freely distributed in the suburbs amongst the recently minted melanin-deprived upper-middle class..

I get it, I’m old and irrelevant.. 

This city/county is completely unprepared for a Cat 3 or 4 storm..
We are ripe for a Katrina event and the bumblefucks who run this place will be profoundly inept to deal with it..

Beryl has acutely demonstrated that fact, in action..

I’m very, very tired and dismayed at the general ‘fuck you’ attitude that stinks up this entire area.. 

And I’m looking right the fuck at you Cinco Ranch.."
Get a generator
I see your Beryl and raise you an Ike. Went for almost a month without power.  It's just something you live and cope with.  Gotta love them live oaks.
"When I moved here two years ago it was the first place I ever lived that the people in the place wanted to hear no wrong about their city, and talked down on every other city. What a funny vacuum bubble this place is.  I’m ironically in California for the month (where I’ve heard them talk the most shit about, after NYC), and I’m enjoying paradise weather, amazing water and produce, and friendly worldly people who look happy, healthy and want to chat.  My Uber eats delivery people here look happier, friendlier and more in shape than the average person over there.  

Picky my apt building in Houston got power very quickly so I’ve been able to help out my family and friends in the area."
I've lived here my entire life and I would absolutely leave if I could. Like this article mentions the fact that we insist on having our own power grid in Texas yet it doesn't hold up and doesn't keep us warm and freezing cold temperatures and doesn't keep us cool and sweltering ones is a huge factor. It will be one thing for people to be without power for a week after you know a huge hurricane. This was a category one. And I took it seriously but most people didn't. Everybody kept laughing reactions on Facebook to anybody that was actually had the nerve enough to try to make preparations. I thought about those people when I sat with no power a couple of days later and wondered if they were still laughing. In a state that has such crazy severe weather something needs to change. And they don't seem to be willing to do it.
Demand better. Singular party rule for 25+ years is the root cause. The marketplace of ideas needs to have more than one option.
Definitely broke me.
Yes we could use a few less people
can't blame them
Welp if we want a better city and state start by voting in all levels. Start by remove tjose who keep the unregulated power con going.

Texans had seen that stupid crippled fuck as our governor since 2015 and they still decided to vote him back in. It’s a shame that Texan pride involves getting bent over a barrel and shown the 50 states as long as we have your guns.
"The only people that should have to pay for this are those that failed the people, the executive branch of the state government and anyone who bought their influence to save a buck."
"Everyone should stay, because Texas will be blue in less than 10 years. We can change not only Texas, but the entire country, by prying control away from those that don't give a shit about the greater good."
What are we even getting out of this city? We bust our ass to pay the insane housing costs and we can't even be guaranteed that we'll have the *privilege* of paying $200+ a month for electricity. The schools are in such a shitty state that the teachers themselves are outright telling their students that they don't give a shit. Cars are ending up on blocks overnight all over town and the police can't even be bothered to write a report about it half the time. I live in an expensive luxury apartment in a nice part of town and I still hear gunshots every other night. And whataburger has gone so far downhill that I won't even eat there anymore. The fuck are we doing.
People need to learn to be self reliant. So many who wait on others to take care of them.

Good glad transplants are leaving. That will help ameliorate a lot of the city’s problems.
"It's the lack of resources and change. If the asshole corrupt idiots in charge did something to hold the electric companies accountable and they required finding solutions to the flooding then this would be a different story.

The horror is caused by the storms, the misery is caused by the politicians and utility companies."
One word: Hellscape!!
"Why have people forgotten hurricanes exist?   Why did power companies stop trimming the trees as they did after Rita?     None of this is new, except people’s surprise and power companies lack of preparation.   Beryl was only a Cat 1."
"When the negatives outweigh the positives then Houston will stop growing. Anyone is free to leave, once the jobs, culture and delicious taqueria food aren’t enough."
"GOOD, out with the weak, keep Houston Strong! /s"
Move so yall can complain about something new
"Lower house prices you say?

Sign me up!

That said, this is the pinnacle of right-wing deregulated idiocy meets left-wing cronyism. We need to drop the partisanship and stay and fight!

Edit: not leaving, already have a dual fuel generator, but buying more Ecoflows and upping my emergency supply of food and water to 30 days. Infrastructure is crumbling everywhere, it's just that the crumbling isn't equally distributed. But it's coming to a city near you if it hasn't already arrived."
good riddance
Anybody that would make their sole decision to leave a city based on a Hurricane is a MORON.
People are stupid. You should expect some inconvenience after a storm.  Mother nature can not be controlled.
Work is gonna wait till we’re all at the office to call off
cant wait to still have to go to work monday
I’m so not in the mood for this fucking bullshit.
I got a flight Monday. I need my flight to get canceled.
Say the line Katy
Should we be concerned about the Livingston dam situation? It'll probably be ok.
"I live a ways west of Houston, it’s going to come pretty much straight over my house."
My bet is the track is going to keep creeping east until it's over Houston.  I mean why should it stop creeping now?
Anyone know of an app or website where I can see what small streets are flooded in the inner loop? Im aware of TxDOT but they usually only report major roads like interstates and US highways. Im trying to prepare for Monday since I have to travel

Bro didn’t we have 100 mph winds like two months ago
How do you think Galveston will fare? Looks to be slightly outside the path but I'd imagine itll still get drenched.
im really worried about the rain. i hope there are moments of reprieve when the rain hits so that drainage systems can get enough time to drain a bit before another deluge comes. at least the storm is moving fast and not hovering over the city from what the weather says.
"If I’m flying in Sun morning, can I fly in?"
Katy evacuation joke
"These big storms bring the attention, but the electricity fails way more often and gets no attention. Summer 2020 we lost power 4 Sundays in a row, for the entire day. The week before the derecho we lost power for two days. There's been countless other days since 2017 where we lost 4+ hours of power at our house."
You know shit is bad when space city weather calls you out...
"No shit. The city has the worst power grid I've ever lived in. I think some solutions like concrete poles and buried distribution lines are solid but will take decades to fully implement - far too late to help solve the problem today. I think there are solutions we can do today that will be effective in a reasonably short (<1 year) window.

- Pass a city ordnance that forbids any trees within x feet of a main power line that serves more than 1 block. This would apply to public and private property.

- Grant the utilities the right to remove trees on private property that fail to meet the prior stipulation.

- Mass trimming campaign of trees near smaller distribution lines starting as soon as power is restored.

- Mandate backup generation (not batteries) at internet service providers and cell towers in areas with more than a certain density.

- More proactive staging of recovery crews at a lower threshold of damage. We shouldn't be waiting 2 days for out of town crews to show up. 

- More stockpiling of transformers, poles, lines etc. The AI boom has a gold rush of tech companies buying all of this for their datacenters. We should get ahead of the curve and stock enough to get to 4 of these events."
RIP Reliant sponsorship for them. Good to see though.
"What we need is a feasible, concrete plan from a genuine expert. That would us something to productively advocate for.

One thing I would like to see is to aggressive trim or cut down trees that pose a danger to the power lines. That would be cost effective, quick to implement and there is no excuse to have this many lines downed by  branches and trees."
"dropping in from Austin where we had similar huge problems in the big freeze and a couple other minor freezes.

The solution is to bury the power lines. Yes it is very expensive, but its really the only solution I see. Our city council is starting to study the feasibility. It doesn't need to all be done at once. But a study needs to be done to see which lines are most vulnerable to wind and start burying some X% per year from most risk to least risk.

Even though its expensive, so is tree trimming, so is having line crews dealing with storms every month."
Time to start burying the powerlines.
This is the voters fault. Educate yourselves on deregulation and stop voting for idiots that prefer a business had more rights than the citizens paying.
"We need & deserve change in our government, & not just at a local level either. Beryl was a Category 1 & it left over a million without power. We are going to be getting major storms, it is an inevitability, and we just proved we cannot handle a category one. Buckle up buttercup."
"Unfortunately, the people of Texas and Houston elect incompetent republicans who only care about the wealthy."
"Unfortunately, we deserve exactly what we got. 😔"
"Since there are those trying to get Texas to secede from the union, can we secede from Texas?"
Energy City? More like Energy Shitty.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
"we got an unreliable and “maybe” map, we can put away the whataburger map! "
"Would’ve been real nice if these guys didn’t spend the majority of the week prior to this event underselling the potential impacts of Beryl to us.

It wasn’t until Friday they finally changed their tone in messaging and even then, pitched this more as a rainmaker than impactful wind event. 

I appreciate the work these guys do, have followed their blog for years and certainly will continue to do so. 

Hopefully they put some more focus on messaging potential impacts to Houston in the future, even if the majority of models agree on tracks elsewhere because we see the fallout from this all over. It creates a false sense of security that corporations and government make decisions off of and then we all pay for. 

Disaster declaration was delayed until after the event happened instead of preemptive.   

Centerpoint didn’t plan. 

Houston police didn’t plan.   

Houston hospitals didn’t plan.   

The list goes on and on."
"Nothing will change until those at the top (at centerpoint, local and regional government) actually suffer.   Suffer in the heat, suffer with loss of property, suffer with the uncertainty of not knowing when the power will come back on.  I GUARNT-GODDMAN-TEE YOU THAT THE CEO OF CENTERPOINT IS NOT SUFFERING."
"IS THAT WHAT IT DESERVES??

How many oil companies we home to?"
"Eric's refusal to state the most simple and direct explanation for this disaster—25 years of Republican rule in Texas caused this—tells you what his words are worth. I used to respect the guy, but this is some grade-A horseshit he's slinging. Dancing around the facts is not what scientists should be doing."
"We paid for one, the greedy motherfuckers at Centerpoint(less) stole the money."
"Ultimately it boils down to cost to the end consumer. Before winter storm Uri we had rates around 7-9 cents per kWh. After Uri we're paying for it with higher rates, 13-14 cents per kWh these days. Now that Beryl has come along it's obvious there are improvements to be made, and we'll have to pay for those too. Are folks willing to pay 20-25 cents per kWh for more reliable service after Beryl? Can Centerpoint build a ""weather-proof"" distribution system, and are you willing to pay 50 cents per kWh for it? $1.00 per kWh? How much are people willing to spend for electricity?"
"Berger and Lanza are trying their hardest to go militant on CenterPoint to deflect blame from themselves for downplaying this storm. How can you blame CenterPoint for not prepping when YOU were only convinced this was a threat a couple days before the storm? Hypocrites.

“We’re not really concerned about Hurricane Beryl and Texas.” Matt Lanza, July 1."
I kept hearing heights had it bad. This validates it.
It worries me we’re two weeks out from hurricane season.
"I've driven around a little, and to me the Heights, Oak Forest, and downtown got hit the worst. Much less tree damage in Montrose and River Oaks"
Those trees make me sad. Obviously less important than life but you can’t replace an old large tree like that in the same way you can rebuild a house.
That house in picture 9 sure was lucky that humongous tree did not fall into it.
Looks just like Ike
"Same in Timbergrove. So many large, mature trees are down. We were lucky, a ~60 foot pine barely missed our house. So many of our neighbors houses have been directly hit by big trees. 

The last time this happened was Ike in 2008, and many of the houses that took direct hits from trees were not salvageable and ended up being demolished."
"Unfortunately, the car under the tree in the first picture was my girlfriend's. She had just gotten the car serviced prior to the storm too. 🙁"
If you draw a line through the dropped transmission towers and heavy damage it's a slightly concave up curve heading to downtown. This was incredibly wild.
I was absolutely shocked driving from the heights to the med center today. It’s like this massive line of destruction that just stops at Allen Parkway. Totally crazy.
I wonder how many insurance companies are going to stop new policies?
any tree/ecology nerd know if there's any way to prevent trees from being uprooted from wind? or is it just bound to happen
Pour one out for the FJ 🥲
I can add a few to that. I was leaving the heights when the storm hit. The most violent part had a direct hit. I was in my car driving through on 610 and eventually made it to an exit to hide under the bridge at TC Jester. The wind was insanely strong and violent
Does anyone in the heights how power?
i was just looking to move closer towards the city.. i think i’ll stay in the spring area now 😭😭
not the FJ!!!
Looks like Spring Branch
"So many lovely, old trees in the Heights, so many lovely, old homes, bungalows...
When we lived on the 1200 block of Cortlandt, the old transformer at the end of the block would punk-out and blow at the drop of a hat. Like, storm on the horizon, wind blows, somebody sneezes or cusses and he was ""Audi 5000, biznatches, I'm outta he-arrr!""
And there was nothing important in that 'hood back then- no retail center on 11th or up and down Heights, no 4-door Porches passing by every minute (more like once a month, if that), and DEF no HPD presence that obviated their storefront off Shepherd, so we always had a week or two or few... wait to get the lights back on. 
After one storm, one weak storm, one punky, lil' storm Erkel woulda whupped one-handed, we spent two weeks in candlelight and a kerosene lantern before our wedding, getting all the little details in place. We had cell phones back then, but not smart phones- all our loved ones had to pick up and do the heavy lifting as we phoned it in!!
Heh, that was before a named storm, can't remember WHO, but we saw our new neighbors, Katrina refugees, walking down the street; they'd just parked their two cars up on the side of I-10, at the Heights St. overpass, in anticipation of flooding...
Love and patience to ALL affected! 
We got room out here in Brenham, just holler!"
Kids school in the heights got hit hard as well
Whoa I used to work in that building in the last pic!
Aw that poor mazda
I hope tree service companies don't fuck over people and jack up their prices to cut trees since now they will be in high demand around the area.
Wow that looks like a tornado
"I live in the Jersey village area, and the storm hit us pretty hard, but somehow we never even lost power. It was crazy bad I thought we where certainly gonna lose power"
Damn even more power lines down than I saw. We are never getting our power turned back on.
Hilshire Village was hit hard too.
Dam Electros lost a big tree too
Instant low rider. The hard way. 😭

a bit more time for it to show us its cards
new nhc update just dropped. This one getting too close for comfort
"> Some stronger than others but the likelihood of a strong storm across a portion of Houston is increasing.

Oh good, I was tired of this two week streak of stable electricity!

Guess I'm off to Total Wine now..."
"Unfortunately it will be tomorrow night before we have a much better idea of what will happen. I refreshed my hurricane kit today. I ate some of the tastier parts of it during the big storm a few weeks ago.

My hope is many of the dead trees and loser limbs came down during the storm earlier this year and we will have less damage than normal for a high wind event."
"Yes, the afternoon forecast has indicated that we should have concerns for early next week. For those who do not or cannot prep for hurricane season, now is the time to buy a bit extra if you can. PLEASE do not panic-buy and leave store shelves empty for the next person who comes along. Stay calm and go to several different stores if you have a large family and need to stock up. Panic is contagious.

Bear in mind that at this point it's still not looking like a crisis for the Houston area. The likelihood is that this will just be a wakeup call for people who don't already have plans. Eye on the Storm [https://yaleclimateconnections.org/topic/eye-on-the-storm/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/topic/eye-on-the-storm/)  has a good explanation for why this probably won't be another Harvey event. But if you really hate driving in the rain and there's an important errand you can take care of tomorrow or the next day, you should do it asap for your own peace of mind.

Eye on the Storm also has concerns for the Lake Livingston Dam. This should not be taken lightly, but shouldn't be cause for immediate panic, either. Quietly buy extra water if you can, though. In a day or two, if it looks like heavy rains could affect that particular area, wash all your clothes and take a shower. Buy baby wipes for waterless showers, too. That dam supplies water to much of Houston.

Editing to add that you can still order water on Amazon and have it delivered by Sunday if you have concerns about the Lake Livingston Dam situation."
Do y'all think it's mostly going to be business as usual in Houston on Monday? I have an appointment  to get my yearly physical for work and no one seems to be talking about closures.
"It seems to me like storms along the western gulf  have a tendency to go north east of where they’re predicting, we saw this with Rita, Ike to an extent, most of the storms that have hit Louisiana over the past decade. 

So I always try to keep my senses alert when a storm is predicted to hit to our south and west, because as we’ve seen so many times just a little tilt in the track can really impact where landfall happens. 

Idk I’m too busy to deal with a hurricane right now, but I’m right along clear lake so I’m paying close attention. 

Really annoyed it’s not a straightforward forecast, but nature rarely is straightforward, especially these days."
"Had a flight booked out of Houston for Tuesday and just rebooked it for super early Monday morning. Even if we don’t get hurricane force winds or damages here, the odds keep climbing for tropical storm conditions."
Not if it's just going to deteriorate in the comments like the banter in this thread.
I think katy Already evacuated.
Any input if flights will depart on Wednesday from IAH?
How about now?
And the models haven’t accounted for northward short-term changes in track that would bring it towards Houston. Not looking good.
"It'll be a tropical storm or a cat 1 likely when it hits us (which is worse case scenario ). I'm ready for the rain. There is also no big time high pressure system sitting near us (like with Harvey), so it'll be moving on. It's actually being predicted to be pulled quite hard N/NE.

We need the rain, and so does central Texas, desperately.


Still showing southwest of matagorda bay.
https://www.hurricanetracker.net/hurricane-beryl"
"Odds are it just causes some widespread rain, lots of widespread rain, but NWS forecasts are like 8 inches at most near landfall, so barring some high pressure system that doesn't currently exists bouncing it off the coast, given how dry it is and the runoff we'll get because of that we're probably just gonna have some not quite but nearing full-ish bayous and thats about it."
Hurricane Watch issued Sargent to mouth of rio grande
"Been watching this storm for days and it was always slowly moving north. Comments on the news fb page show others seeing the same but this morning was the first time the major news networks said it shifted north. If you look at all the other major hurricanes they do the same thing. There is definitely trends happening and if I remember correctly when Harvey hit, the eye hit Rockport and was considering a tropical storm when it made landfall."
"Since we are all here, where could I evacuate with my cat in a carrier going west, north, or east? Any suggestions on what to do with kitty when I get there? Its my first time planning to evacuate."
If if hits it’ll be this weekend correct?
Hope everyone's insurance is up-to-date. No changes now that there is a watch up.
"If you don't got a generator, buy one now. If you can't afford it immediately use Affirm and pay it off later.

Finally found a hotel. Confirmed they were open and had power so I booked a room. Get there and they’re closed with a sign on the door. The employees standing right behind the door wouldn’t even answer the phone. I think this was my final breaking point & now I’m just crying in my car because I can’t take one more night of the heat
"Dawn of the Third Day. I never thought I'd miss electricity so much. I can deal with the no lights, showering in the dark, and no electronics. Working overnights, my main reprieve from the heat is during the coolest parts of the day while sleep, which never comes easy even on powered days, is in the hottest time. I dream I'll be jostled awake with the sound of the A/C rumbling to life but instead waking up with my undershirt soaked from sweat. The things I would do for just a fan to help. 

Food is now spoiled even though the fridge has only been opened an infinitesimal amount of time. Doing anything at home is exhausting with the humidity so I pretend to drive around in my air conditioned car in search of non-existent ice and watch people incapable of navigating a temporary four way stop. See people sitting in line for gas or for food probably also enjoying the bit of cool air left in their world as we all wish for sweet release from this nightmare on the sun.

Anyway, we delivered the bomb."

In before CenterPoint blames the rain this afternoon for why they didn’t deliver estimates on restoration this morning as promised.

"77063 - off fondren and westheimer, no power. My complex just sent an email out saying there’s an electricity pole down behind the building and Centerpoint can’t provide an estimated time of when things will be up. Think I’m gonna rent a car and head to Louisiana.

"77009 - had no power for 6 days during the derecho. Now on day 4 without power. I just can’t believe this is what the state of Houston is. I prepared for the power to go out but like a fool, I expected more of them after May’s fiasco."
[deleted]
WTF is this rain ☹️
The rain is definitely gonna delay the restoration but it is definitely a great relief from the hot weather
At least it’s cooler than it was. So that’s fun
77004 - Just got power around 1pm 🥹
Probably safe to assume that centerpoint still not having estimates for the vast majority of the city is a bad sign yeah? Am I to understand that they have not even scheduled work to begin in those areas?
"This might be a long shot. Does anyone have a lead to a 2 or 3 bedroom Airbnb in the Houston metro with power and capabilities to take 4 adults and a 7 day old baby starting tomorrow? No one is answering on the other listings. Happy to pay market rate and everything. We’re just currently getting kicked out of our current one tomorrow due to another renter. Because our power came back on so we prepared to go back to Heights, but now it’s off again. And we’re SOL for tomorrow and beyond."
"Is this getting national coverage?  After Harvey, there were armies of rescue vehicles and help here within days from across the country.  Was great to see people working together.  People are just suffering here and nobody locally or nationally is taking charge. Maybe I'm missing some coverage, going on 84 hours without power."
Another night of drinking on the porch staring at the apartment complex 100 feet from me that has power 😭
"Wow. So most of Houston is blue or green now. Interesting. How did they asses anyone so fast??

EDIT: I spoke with someone at CenterPoint and was told that a crew hadn’t been assigned to my area yet and there was no ETA. She also mentioned that the map had been updated and will continue to be updated. So I checked the map and I’m in a blue area now (yesterday I was orange) but …how if there hasn’t been a crew assigned yet. I’m confusion and this heat isn’t helping lol"
I just opened the windows after the storm passed and man that feels so fucking good
"My elderly parents finally got power about 25 mins ago in 77070, neighborhood between grant and mills🙌. thank you linemen, fuck centerpoint.


I also live in 77070, north side of 249, no power yet🫠"
Ain’t this a bitch!? Literally every apartment complex but mine has power on my street.
I’m beginning to think this is a Centerpoint problem and not a Beryl problem.
We should start counting the fatalities from delay in medical care. I just finished a shift and my hospital is absolutely broken. People always say that healthcare is collapsing. It’s already collapsed. People with admit orders sitting in the ED waiting room for >8 hours (after admission!). The majority of them due to having no electricity.
Centerpoint reporting 500k customers could be without power until next week: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07ufDWQJvfs
"Is it just me or is Centerpointless restoring power to retail stores seem a bit more of a priority over restoring power to residents first? We live in Meyerland and all of the stores around our neighborhood have power but many if not most of my neighborhood has no power.
I understand that restoring power to hospitals, stations for emergencies, city government offices etc is acceptable but is restoring power with more emphasis on retail before residents acceptable if it is happening? So the question is, Would your rather get power first before your grocery store and favorite retail store/restaurant or would you want power on at retail stores so you can get the hell out of the house and sit somewhere else for a while? Let me know your thoughts.
EDIT: From my perspective, restoring power to emergency operations is key but residents should be next. I really don’t like going through all this with a wife who had 3 panic attacks after the storm and a 7 year old who had no clue why we have no “Food Power”, (she thinks electricity makes our food. She is so cute)."
"Anyone else see the horrible attempt at pity baiting that centerpoint is doing on twitter,  we know that wind knocks down trees but it should've been cleared off days ago. Wtf?"
The outage map doesn't even show an estimated time for our area. I want to scream but I don't have the energy for it.
just got power back at 77459 near Lexington/dulles!
77498 had power since yesterday and now it’s out again.  Damn.  Just bought groceries and now depending on how long it takes might just be a loss again.  This sucks.
The #s on the tracker are going down alarmingly fast (or just faster than I’m used to) and instead of making me feel better it’s making me more anxious that we still don’t have power 😵‍💫
"Seeing a recent trend on social media of people starting to stand up for Centerpoint? One boomer on Next door said he feels sorry for them because it was a ""freak event"" and that's the price of having trees. First of all, we're on the gulf coast. This shit is fairly predictable. Second of all, Florida has trees too, asshole. They had power up 4 days after a Cat 4 hit them a few years ago.

Then, I see posts on IG where people are saying we should be supporting the linemen. No shit. I don't think anyone is mad at the actual guys working the problem. It's *Centerpoint* that is a bag of flopdicks. We can be mad at CP and still treat the linemen well. I don't know how people are getting confused here.

Fucking morons."
"It’s STORMING now??? This might be the end of me, I swear it. If my power even flickers I’m going to freak out. I just got power back last night"
This flair will be permanent. Fucking ass company
genuinely what am i supposed to do with all the anger i have?
[deleted]
"77095 no power. Crazy past 12 hours. Dropped kids off at my sisters. Avoided house like the plague, got home around midnight, wife and I grabbed dogs stayed in car till 1:30 am listening to our 57 hr book. Went to convenience store bought cold water, came home took freezing cold shower, went to bed at 2 with cold water by our sides and one in front of a portable fan. Still woke at 6 AM sweating, grabbed dogs, slept in car till 9. This is hell."
"77043, everyone but my apartment complex has power. Can't wait to move back to California."
Has anyone heard anything about the midday ETA tracker? Or did they forget people are desperately waiting on that to make accommodations as necessary...
77007 got power back at our apartment complex near Cleveland Park
77018 no power - 43rd and rosslyn
"77092 - if you have been running a generator since the storm, it’s probably time to change your oil (every 50-100 hours). The hotter the temperature, the faster it runs through oil. Also, check your oil level every day. My generator kept shutting down and after a bunch of troubleshooting I realized there was very little oil."
"Just yelling into the dark here, but I think hurricane categories and tropical storm ranking/types should be reconsidered.

After Katrina, Ike, Harvey, Memorial Day, This years tornando, and this past week, the only type of storm that has ever felt to be understood properly was Harvey.

The way the world hasn’t learned to combat storms after we all stopped to see Katrina in the media is baffling. I will never forget being a teenager and just seeing people CONSISTENTLY be filmed to be picked up by helicopter 24/7"
"77077 energy corridor. Just came back on 😭

Edit: lmao thunderstorms rolled in and it promptly went out again. Lasted about 30 minutes."
"77066 (Klein) 2:40pm


Still no power for blocks, traffic lights still dark


Cell service has returned to full 5G strength (at least for T-Mobile)


Crews managed to move the fallen utility poles out of the roadways, but still have yet to see any linemen doing any replacements / repairs


If you look on CP tracker, it shows we are green, but it's a lie. Power out on Bammel N Houston from Veterans to BW8 and everything within at least a two mile radius."
"77573 League City. Just got powered back, hopefully it stays on. Thank you for everyone in this thread for keeping me sane.  Hopefully the rest of you get your power soon!"
"77009 - Norhill. Still no power. All my friends have power back, and I'm feeling a little sad about not. Some friends got power back at 930 last night so I'm trying to stay hopeful. But the light at Studewood and 14th which was on yesterday is now off, and I am taking that as an ominous sign. "
77339 absolutely nothing no progress no trucks and staring down the barrel of day 5. I went to the bathroom and didn't try to flip on the light reflexively so I guess you could say I'm broken.
"77090- Cypress Station. No power, nor have I seen any workers. Several trees down on other apartments, saw one tree on lines near Red Fern and Wild Oak. "
77007 Jackson at Wash by Memorial. Nothing. 
Odds that Centerpoint actually gives estimates before noon?
"I know this is a smaller issue with the power being out but for those that are having Xfinity problems on their [outage credit page](https://www.xfinity.com/support/account-management/credits/outage/details), don’t forget to claim your outage credit! I tried and was able to claim $5. $5 is better than nothing."
"I'm at my boyfriends place in 77031. He's had power since the night of the storm. 


It just started storming here and power went out"
77459 - Sienna - Lots of people getting messages that power will be on by end of day tomorrow.
"77018- garden oaks near 34th/brinkman- still no power. We finally packed up and went to stay with a friend two miles away who does have power and wtf I forgot how good AC feels. 

My street is in the “circuit assigned” status of the map they released yesterday but no dice. I got a text from CenterPoint at midnight saying they hope to provide specific restoration times by eod 7/11."
77077 still dark at briar forest and kirkwood. Abc13 reporting that only 400k homes will be restored by EOD FRIDAY. Friday?? What about today? And that still leaves 750k without power until next week.
"77024 Still no power. Still no progress on the massive tree down and the power line it snapped like twig on Memorial. Out and about yesterday to cool and refuel, and there are still trees down and obstacles in the roads around here that look like they haven't even been taped off or addressed at all. Cleanup has started, but repairs seem a ways off. 

Wife's office downtown never lost power (shocker) and when she went in yesterday, it took Centerpoint all of about two and a half hours to get her connected parking garage's entry arms, elevators, and lights operational with a few calls placed. Memorial City Mall up and running (to it's defense it's likely grid to the Hospital.) Even listening to the Astros in the dark is weird knowing there is a sports stadium downtown all lit up. Priorities I suppose. 

I called my folks last night to see if we could come stay with them in Bellville until we get power back. That caused a riff because my dad was like Come on with it and my mom said yes, but  we wouldn't be able to bring our two dogs. So now I'm going to spend the morning looking for a legit boarding / pet spa place that may be open so we can head out to my folks. If not, we ride it out here. 

Apologies for the rant, I've slept like 5 hours in the past three days."
"77379... no power, no internet, no data, text only. This sucks! I never thought I would miss the local news.. those local news apps on my phone wont work unless I drive 30 miles to find a cell tower that gets my phone working. I am managing thou, drove into work (Med Center) and have internet! Such a huge help, I can now figure out what stores are open and where to go to get gas. And I can make calls!! 

My home/cars survived-but barely-so lucky I parked where I don't normally do. I remember Ike was not this bad and it took 14 days then to get power..  I had my wife go pick up my brother in-law and head to her mom's. I am home taking care of the cats, and feeding the generator. Its a small generator that just powers the fridge/freezer and one fan. I know thats better than most have it.. am blessed."
77479 - next to University BLVD in Sugar Land. No Power.
"If this update is to be believed, the % of areas with actual estimates (and thus actual work orders) is absurdly low. Maybe 1 of every 25 I click in the inner loop has an estimate. We are fucked."
[deleted]
77066- still no power.
"77098 - off buffalo speedway and richmond. Still no power, but only in this complex and the one next door. Everyone else seems to have power"
"77088 some neighborhoods have power, some don’t. Happened last time after the derecho. I’m anticipating another few days without power"
"77096, near Chimney Rock and West Bellfort, no power.   There is power running along Chimney Rock, but as soon as you enter the neighborhood the power disappears."
"77007 near Durham and Washington. Still no power. Houses a block over have power, which makes it feel somehow worse. Most of my neighbors seem to have fled to hotels or out of town. 

Starting to feel pretty hopeless."
"77077 Briar Forest & Dairy Ashford area. No power. Drove around a lot in the early morning/night. I’m not seeing much damage. After a long cruise I only spotted a few trees in lines, and two actual power lines down. 

I know there’s more than what I can find, but damn does it feel like there’s “more” bullshit this time around with Center Point."
"77388, no power.  Been ‘blue’ since Tuesday.  No end expected.  Have been running a 6,250 watt gas generator since Monday evening to power fridges and deep freeze and we are blessed to have two portable a/c’s to help us sleep at night."
"Really sorry for all those without power. I hope shit gets fixed soon.

Does anyone have information on xfinity outages in Montrose and surrounding areas?"
"77070, right at the intersection of Louetta & 249. Received notice that they’re expecting power back EOD Friday."
"77586 - Seabrook 

My apartment building has had power since Monday afternoon but I just learned this morning there’s several buildings here still in the dark.

I work across the street from JSC and on my way in I saw Centerpoint staging trucks and setting up tents at Clear Lake Park.

Hopeful that more of this area will come back online today."
77077 I just passed a load of trucks fixing the downed lines near highway 6. I hope this means we’re back by tonight!
"77074, was stuck on the corner of Fondren and Beechnut after the storm and saw repair crews putting up a new post. Not sure if that’ll solve our problems and get the lights back on, but that’s the first crew I’ve seen all week."
"Neighbor just texted that the powers back on in 77449, west little York and fry"
77004. My biggest concern now is the afternoon thunderstorms. This can’t be helped because weather. But it will continue to slow things down. And I hate the daily texts from Centerpoint that everything’s fixed when I can walk out my front door and see that it’s not. The teasing only makes it worse.
"With each passing day with no power, I become more radicalized. Death to CenterPoint"
lol and now thunderstorms
77042 and I can’t believe I’ve come home from work day 4 and still no power. I’m so tired of this. I just want a good nights sleep.
I haven't had a hot meal in 4/5 days that I thought McDonald's was good even though I haven't eaten from them in like 4-5 years
"SIREN SIREN SIREN AIRHORN AIRHORN AIRHORN

UNDER 1 MILLION CUSTOMERS WITHOUT POWER

AIRHORN AIRHORN AIRHORN SIREN SIREN SIREN"
"“We will continue to provide estimated restoration times as they become available” seems like in other words - nobody has given a shit about your area yet, we have changed the color from orange to blue to calm you down"
"77498, village of oak lake. Still no power. Cannot sleep well due to heat... Probably slept for 3 hours within the last two days"
"77022 nawfside (Fulton, crosstimbers) no power since 4 am Monday, saw crews all around the McDonald’s yesterday but alas no update. Palmyra and Appleton have power though, not all of the zip does."
[deleted]
Wtf does “Assessment Complete” mean
So noon was bullshit. Of course it was. 88.7 is talking to the CPVP right now.
"77024 @ Memorial & Chimney Rock - still no power since early AM Monday, but Centerpoint upgraded our restoration status in their outage map from Orange (Assessment in Progress) to Blue (Assessment Complete), so progress(?). Only thing is they also upgraded almost everyone else in the city so I must question the reliability of the map."
7/11 is doing free slurpees today. At least on Longpoint and Blalock in Spring Branch
77063 still no power here & haven’t seen any trucks
77056. Saw the map updated that our area becomes dark green. We are still without power.
77584 on for awhile. ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
77088 West Montgomery near Paradise cemetery.  Light returned at 7 pm after being out since Monday morning. Happy to be cooling down but scared of it happening again.
"77006 still no power. On commonwealth and Waugh right behind The Flat, I fear workers see the lights from the bar, if they have driven by, and think we have power too. Seems all streets around us have regained power except D’Orleans(complex name). Service requests have been made but I still haven’t seen a single service truck in our area and we’re approaching day 5. Losing morale."
"77077, Briarforest and Kirkwood, spotted a CP truck working just a few minutes ago, so fingers crossed 😭"
POST YOUR GOD DAMN CROSS STREETS. ZIP CODES ARE LARGE.
"Sometimes, I get giddy when I think about the day that my power returns. And then I enter a new level of irrational fear that my life is now just the 1800s forever. 

Also, if I haven’t said it before, thank you to this community for keeping me sane. Reddit always comes thru 🙏🏼"
"77055 near Blalock and Long Point. No power, but power all around us. Our block has a blown fuse, we are a nested outage, so very low priority for Centerpoint"
"77003- downed lines, downed pole, still nothing. I’m starting to get pissed."
77007. Still no power but water came back which was out before. On our way down Jackson hill this morning we saw a line crew working on the intersection of Jackson hill and Feagan so hopefully good news soon!
"77086 no power since Monday 7am - neighborhood got power Tuesday around 9pm, transformer blew (heard large boom) and power went out for my house and a couple of other houses on the block. Scared we’ll be last to get power back sometime next week since we’re so few houses. Very similar thing happened during Ike and we lost power for 18 days while streets surrounding us had power about a week in. Attempting to take my elderly mother to an airbnb. 

Kinda hoped things would be different or at least faster than what it was nearly 20 years ago…"
"lol somehow the number on Centerpoint's website has gone up by 8,136 customers since I started checking it at 6:30 this morning.

It was like this yesterday in the AM too though, then in the afternoon the number started dropping substantially. Hopefully all this means is they are needing to shut off power to complete some repairs for an even bigger number of people. Hope everyone's power comes back soon."
"Excellent news! My neighborhood in Meyerland has been assessed. Idk wtf that means but I hope they finish soon. I’d like to sleep in my bed sometime in the near future. 

What pisses me off the most is that there is a vacant church building 100 ft from my house that has power. wtf?"
They meant noon Pacific Team obviously
I’ve calculated that 87% of customers in Houston were without power at one point? So that means like 6 million people? 2.7 people per “customer”? just trying to get a sense of the scale
"Sitting in the restaurant and heard a bunch of alerts go out

I don’t get those, so what’s wrong please don’t tell me there’s something else coming our way aside from the current thunderstorms"
"Lost power at the office around 2, I-10 and Echo"
77386 - East of 45 and north of 99 still no power. Getting word that we might be out until Monday and that’s BEST case scenario. I’m at a loss for words. Rapidly losing hope and I still have to show up to work every single morning it’s getting so exhausting.
77066 front side just got power. And the A/C turned on right when I was typing this up. Thank you linemen!!!
"77346.  Huge boom, then power for 7 seconds, now nothing. Ugh"
77006 my building was restored yesterday and we’ve somehow lost power again? Disgusted
"Centerpoint made $6.7 billion in gross profit this year (ending March 31, 2024).

Just food for thought"
77025 got power ITS A BIRTHDAY MIRACLE
"We’re an hour away from 12P and that’s when they said they’d give us time estimates… 👀👀. Very low expectations that they abide by that deadline, though 🤷🏻‍♀️"
"77008, the Heights, W 28th St near the Starbucks. Still no fucking power."
"Did anyone see the update CenterPoint put out a 8? It was basically “we plan to let everyone know tonight what their estimated repair date is. Except for sure by tomorrow night. Also we’re super proud of that fact that only 20% of you will probably be sitting in the dark past Sunday!!! OH ALSO we gave out bottled water to the cooling centers! See guys, we shipped them some water!”"
"77459 1092 and Highway 6, no power"
77047 no power yet. Out since Monday 5 am
Mega hread Beryl Houston
[deleted]
"77043 - Near Spring Woods HS - No power since 6am Monday

Purely anecdotal, but today's map is significantly more accurate than yesterday's re: correctly identifying the power status of friends' houses around the area.

The issue is with the blue ""Assessment Complete"" classification...I know for a fact that there are a number of snapped poles and large trees down on lines all along the east side of Nob Hill Park, and that whole area is in the blue. So I mean...I'm glad they've supposedly ""assessed"" it, but there's no way to know whether that's a ""we're fixing everything today"" or ""it's going to take 3 weeks to replace the poles and get the lines back up""."
"77007 Asbury and Memorial. Ironically, we had power through the hurricane and up until yesterday at 11 am.  Then it suddenly went out and remains out.  No idea what's going on."
"77040, saw five lineman trucks on hollister and little York. Hang in there everyone."
"77007 (off tc jester and petty) we got power Tuesday night, enjoyed it all day yesterday, woke up to no AC today. Anyone else? We got a message from CenterPoint that an interruption was detected early this morning"
"77586, still no electricity. Based on what I saw driving around last night and this morning, it looks like pretty much all of Seabrook and El Lago are still without power except for a few businesses on NASA 1. It's incredibly eerie at night. 

It feels like it may be well into next week before my home gets power back. My cat is physically doing okay with the heat, but I can tell she's unhappy and she's taking it out on me by biting my feet while I (try to) sleep because I'm not under the covers. What's a good way to keep a cat cool without air conditioning? I tried wrapping her in a wet towel last night but she wasn't having it."
"Clicked around to all my cousin’s places to see if there would be information on ETA, none of the 5+ houses I clicked on have ETAs, nice."
77008 still don’t have power. What does “Assessment Complete” even mean on the outage tracker?
"77077 half of my complex came on a few minutes ago, the other half still dead


Edit: And now it's off again. Not even an hour

Edit 2: Spoke with a centerpoint rep about it on the phone and supposedly a technician is already en route to assess the secondary outage.

Better than scheduled for a fix I guess?"
"77060, haven't even seen a truck and have lost all hope at this point."
"Any updates for the 77459 general area? But more specifically, in and around that HEB. Last time I checked, which as about 3-4 hours ago, no power yet but still had water"
77033 here near Gulfgate - update that someone in my neighborhood called CP and said that there’s a transformer and circuit out and they can’t do anything until the transformer is up and there’s no timeline on that. Anyone here up and running that had a transformer replaced? Starting to lose hope that it’ll even be fixed before the end of this weekend.
77064 power just got restored
"77355, Stagecoach area

Still no power. Trucks were out in the area, lots of people around us reporting power on. The ""map"" says our estimated time of restoration is the 12th, but I got a text from CP saying our outage is being assessed. I have no faith in any of it. A fool's hope."
77033 - crestmont near gulfgate power came back around 7:30. A neighbor was told by CP there were no estimates on timeline (and we had no ETA on the map) bc of a blown transformer and then an hour later our power was back on
I'm new to adulting - is Centerpoint responsible for the infrastructure for the electricity and then we select our own energy provider? Never really heard about Centerpoint until the past hurricane.
"I know most people won’t like the rain

But the rain cool air is nice"
"Wanted to drop this in the thread in case anyone wanted to get really mad before 9am.

>Abbott's absence during a major weather event is unusual, said Darryl Paulson, a political scientist at the University of South Florida.

>“It’s standard operating procedure for governors of a state in a natural disaster situation to cancel any trips they may have planned to stay in their state and handle what potentially could be a massive state emergency,” Paulson said.  
In 2008, when Hurricane Gustav was in the Gulf of Mexico, Perry and then-Florida Gov. Charlie Crist canceled plans to attend the Republican National Convention in Minnesota even though both had spent weeks planning their trips. The storm never hit Texas or Florida, but because it could have, governors from all the Gulf Coast states stayed home.

>“The governor’s responsibility first is to the people of his state and protecting the people of his state,” Paulson said.

>Abbott's office did not respond to questions about his decision to continue with the trip. In an interview with Fox 7 Austin on Wednesday, Abbott said he didn't regret staying in Asia and has been able to be “fully engaged” in the state’s response.

>It’s “the exact same thing, really, that I would be doing if I were there in Austin, Texas,” the governor said.

As fucking if, Abbott. The dude is in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea."
"I can’t believe I’m now coming to terms that Dallas is a better city to live in than Houston. Sure it gets cold there but doesn’t get battered with TS and hurricanes. 

A Category 5 hurricane will level this city like it did Katrina. New Orleans has rebounded but the people have left."
77027 - Still no power. Wish I cleared out my fridge a couple days ago.
They have changed the color on the map from orange to blue for almost everyone.
Um did anyone else get an alert about carbon monoxide poisoning?
"77070 near Grant Rd and 1960. Lots of subdivisions have power. Mine half of it has power and the other half doesn't ( the half that I live in doesn't 😭,) talk about bad luck. 
Anyone boiling water ? I heard that if your water pressure went down at any point it's better to boil water ."
"77086 northwest park has no power, our food is all spoiled now and there is limited resources around 249/ Antoine area.  

Take a moment to flood center point with complaints :https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corp/pages/leadership.aspx"
77042 still no power
"Not adding to the main post,  but the Houston food bank has opened distribution centers in Baytown and points west. 

Go to contact the food bank for further information or to volunteer."
"77042 - No power and the hope I was holding is running thin. I'm supposed to go to the All Star Game in Arlington next Tuesday. I should be excited about that but frankly, I'm more excited for power and sleeping in A/C. Never thought I'd be happy about being in the DFW area."
"77373 - No power. 

Entire Spring area from 45/ 1960/louetta/59 is out. Joe V running on a generator is open as is Kroger and 2 gas stations but that is all I have i seen.

Numerous entire neighborhoods still untouched including my own. I anticipate another several days at this rate. Seems east of 45 has been forgotten."
"77080 

No Power on our side of the street, but they've had it across he street since Monday at 8pm. it's maddening watching your neighbors (who I like) go back to the normal routine while we are still powerless."
"77096 near the Foodarama plaza, still woke up to no power.

This roller coaster ride of “maybe it’ll come on today” to “I’m afraid it won’t be until after the weekend” is giving me mental whiplash and my nerves are cooked 🥴"
"I would say Centerpoints latest update at 8 AM is pretty emblematic of their overall response to this hurricane.

For posterity’s sake, as of now it is blank."
77346 - no power - starting to go a little crazy
77069–no power for much of Wunderlich. Rows of sweltering apartments full of a lot of elderly. Lady without her CPAP.
Any updates relating to Fort Bend? All I see and hear about is Harris County…
[deleted]
"77008 along tcjester and 11th street

Nothing"
77042 near Westpark Dr and the beltway. The outage map just updated my area to saying that the estimated time I’ll get power is the 13th. I’m actually going to lose my mind.
77450- AT&T internet back on as of 2PM
"77063 my row of townhome are the only ones with power in our complex on Jeanetta. 

I have a slanted power pole in front of my complex, and one of the major intersection still has downed traffic lights.

Had power back since Tuesday night and I am so paranoid about this storm…and I adore rain storms. Can’t even enjoy one of my favorite things man
"Houston: We need our power back on

Mother Nature: Hold my beer"
"Will there be any financial aid available in the coming weeks? For example, lost wages fur to the inability to work when the business is closed for lack of power or damages"
"Restoration estimates coming before noon, I'm ready to be disappointed https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/about-us/news/1779"
77002 we’ve had power during this whole thing and it JUST went out omg 😭
"Saw trucks near 77024 around noon today, keep checking my Xfinity app to see if my power is back up but have had no luck. Just Sitting at the pluckers bar waiting to watch the Astros game because my apartment is too hot to go back to.

This is probably the most Houston thing Ive ever said in my life."
77007 Jacksonhill and feagan just got power 15 minutes ago
"77092, still no power and Centerpoint's map, if it can be trusted, still has us in the yellow.

Edit to add nearby cross street: 43rd and TC Jester."
"77373 - no end in site. 
The outage tracker map doesnt even have a color for my neighborhood."
"77006, between commonwealth and Waugh right behind The Flat. Still no power. I’m immediately up against The Flat, which hasn’t lost power once… feels like a smack in the face."
77459 no power.  I’m so tired man.
Why do we still have 2 threads with power updates rather than just 1 big megathread for everything???
77009 - near 14th & Studewood - still no power this morning.
"77339 Kingwood, Forest Cove

It's fucked. There's a downed pine tree over wires and a snapped pole behind Metro Self Storage off of Kingwood Drive. Don't think a Centerpoint truck has even come out to see it. Feeling like we'll be some of the very last to get power back

Straight up not having a good time, yo. I want to run for the hills but I have nowhere to run to"
"77056 Richmond and Sage, still no power anywhere around us. Our neighbor who knows people warned us that’s she’s been told at least a week more but who knows. 

Of course the CP map has our entire area green for some reason and they haven’t emailed me or texted me updates once."
Lol. You had to specify that Lakewood church IS open. 😂
77021 near Scott and ost power back
"77346, Atascocita area. Elderly parents with no power. Their bedroom up to 90 degrees. Found a room in New Caney for them but by the time I’d entered all information it had been booked. Was able to snag a room downtown for 3x the price but it’ll be worth it for them to cool off, get some sleep and a shower. Is it just me or is this exhibit 275 as to why major utilities in a major metro area shouldn’t be privatized?"
77429 got power back Wednesday morning. Just lost it again.
"Libraries are open as cooling centers. 

~~Pink~~ link is in the main page"
I'm ready for my MREs.
"77071 Gessner/Beltway: no power for me but surrounding businesses/streetlights. Some apartment buildings on my same block seem lit up (though I’m not sure if just their security/parking lot lights are on or if individual units also have power). Which is all wild to me but I’m not an electrician so I’m not sure how all that works. 

Ready for this to end"
Can’t even take a cold shower

"77545 we got power yesterday, today almost 24 hours later we lost power, half an hour later got power once more and now have been without power for over 2 hours"
"77459 - Sienna - Power in a weird state compared to yesterday. The front of Sienna with HEB and several gas stations has lost its power and instead Steep Bank Trace on the Ridge Point High School side, at least near Sienna Parkway, has power. Here's to hoping that the majority of Sienna will have power by the end of the day tomorrow."
Looking to get a backup Internet. Xfinity is down in my area. Any recommendations?
"77018, in Oak Forest my parents just got power."
"77007 Our live power line is still down in our street, multiple neighbors have notified Centerpoint Emergency, no trucks in sight, no hope in sight. Losing my mind.."
"Question.  

Did any of the 2021 Infrastructure Bill go towards electrical infrastructure? And if so how much went to the State of Texas, and where that money was used?"
"I'm at my boyfriends place in 77031. He's had power since the night of the storm. 


It just started storming here and power went out"

77080 - residential near spring woods middle school. Still out of power.

77071 gessner and belfort no power. Thermostat said 93 degrees yesterday. Me and my dogs slept in the car. They fell asleep instantly. It was nice to not have them panting for their lives for a night but I’m still going to take my older one to the vet when I can because I don’t want any lasting effects from the heat.
77546; Galveston County side of Friendswood that borders Alvin- still no power or internet if you have xfinity.
Looking to hear an update about 77007 by Jackson Hill and Feagan. Thank you ♡

"77077 Eldridge energy corridor, still no power. Looking more grim as time passes"
"77040, Hollister/Hwy 290 outage: Still no power last i saw when i left a little after 7:30 AM. I’ve finally cracked mentally and am also finally being pulled off somewhere to keep me cool (and hopefully a little more sane). Across 290, a bunch of the office buildings are now up and running but nothing on the residential side."
"77389- no power passed Gosling/ W Rayford. 
This city is a failure. Time to leave. It is no longer the city I grew up in and enjoyed."

77056 Richmond & S. Rice - Still no power. Haven’t had more than 3 hours sleep in 2 days. Spend part of the night in the car trying to cool the dogs down & the rest in the house not able to sleep from the heat & the constant worry that the dogs are over heating.
"77375 

Power was restored to our apt complex sometime overnight. Not sure when because we couldn't stay in that oven with a 5 month old, but I was happy to see it on when I drove by this morning. Parents house in 77447 still without power, but they do have a  small generator. Here's to hoping every one else gets some relief soon, and I hope everyone applies for whatever aid we might be able to get. Cleaning out the refrigerator and freezer today, if the dumpster ever gets emptied.... 

Also, what's with all the gas stations not being able to get fuel trucks in to refill?? It's not like the area is flooded any more. Really not understanding that part. So many gas stations just out of service now because no gas. Bring in the trucks...."
"77459 - 
Vicksburg - no power

Dry Creek - most have had power for 2 days

Parks Edge - half got power last night half with no power 

Quail Valley - no power

Lake Olympia - few small sections with power


UPDATE: All of Parks Edge appears to have power and crews have been spotted in Lake Olympia and Quail Valley. No signs of power yet, but people are in the area working.

UPDATE 2: Parts of Quail Valley have power but still no word on Lake Olympia or Vicksburg."
77077 Westheimer and Kirkwood turned blue with the 9am map update so that’s at least an update lol
Is there a map of water outages?
Any hotels with vacancy in the loop or league city area?
Considering going to a truck stop to shower
"Update for Lake Olympia pwky at Vicksburg 77459 has power now. Also the gas station at that corner has gas.

"77070 willowchase, still no power, i haven’t commented this much on reddit till now 😔"

"77338 still no power on Wilson Rd between 1960 and 1st St, Wilson road blocked off near Isaacks"
"77338. 1960 W and Foxwood near IAH airport. I was just out and it looks like no one is working on anything out here. They have power towards Deerbrook Mall, past 59(1960 E) but nothing West going towards 45. Has anyone seen anything, any trucks?"
77379 still no power. I did see some utility trucks by the pool in Colony Creek. Looked like they had already flagged a power line. So hopefully that means power will come on soon.
77354. Durango Creek and Honea Egypt just got power.
Irvington and Crosstimbers no power. But at Irvington and Bennington they have power. Make it make sense. Also not one tree crew has been by our area
77581 Dixie and 518 just got power
77429 - Cole's Crossing - Finally have power once again
"For people in Entergy territory, here's the Thursday 7/11 evening update: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/lcrjvli/"
"77070 Cypresswood and Cutten 


 Got an email from my apartments office saying our half of the complex should have power by around midnight. Apparently they spoke to an actual Centerpoint representative so here's hoping I guess. "
"77338- no light yet.  I’m in foxwood area, but I’m seeing on the next door app that some people are getting power back with this zip code."
"Reminder:

1.  Check the main post for new information. 

2. Don't be in a hurry to completely restock your refrigerator once you get power. 

3. Think about your placement of your generator."
r/justahoustonpervert can the comments be automatically sorted by new?
77007 - Still no power.
[deleted]
77045 power back on. Time for change.
"77386, power near Harmony.  Bit of ironic timing as we had just spent a few hours cleaning up while there was daylight and tossing out all of the perishable food.  We were pulling away when in a bit of dark humor tried the garage door opener and it actually opened."
77004 still no since Monday morning
"I just saw a CP truck/trailer, and it drove away 
Sad day"
"77080 - some power but not in my neighborhood. Friend on the other side of Kempwood has had power since Tuesday (centerpoint map says they don't). We had trucks on our street yesterday, power came in for a few seconds then shut off. Trucks left."
77373 no power since 6am Monday 😔
"77008 near heights high. Still no power, haven’t seen any trucks either so…"
77043 - no power and still have trees and lines down on roads.
"77062, off clear lake city blvd, no power. My area is still orange on the map so losing hope each day that I’ll get power anytime soon. Been going to the library for a cooling and charging station but that’s gotten old fast. I agree with a poster on here that said the food isn’t worth the misery. Time to think of a plan to move elsewhere as this has gotten exhausting."
77043 we have power but there is still a huge tree through our roof and management won’t reply when asked about follow-up.
"77085. S. Post Oak and S. Main-ish. No power, but a friend lent us their genny. So now we have hot air circulating, wifi and a working fridge. There’s power about 6 houses down our street which is making me even saltier."
"77098 still no power, 1 of the 4 buildings in our apartments have power. We may not get power until much later considering the circuit is energized and it's just some fuses or transformers that are out.. center point has no updates for any further fixes..."
"77586 - Trucks in the area all afternoon doing tidying up, but still no power."
"77037 got a text that power was back yesterday. 40 minutes later got another text that power was back out for 23 customers. In other words, my side of the street is out while the neighbors across from us all have power. Scared that we’re going to be put as a low priority since it’s only 23 of us."
77008 near TC Jester. Still no power
"77017 in Pasadena/near Hobby Airport. 3 days of no power, just opened our last case of water. All food is bad and we have ate out at 3 different fast food places the were (gratefully) open the past few nights, and snacked for lunch. There is power inconsistently strewn throughout the Pasadena area, including on Spencer Hwy. my dad, brother and myself made hotel reservations in the middle of the night last night (we went to sit in the car around 1am) for a couple of days nearby. I have two cats who I’ve been monitoring and we will be leaving behind because the prices are truly exorbitant; I would do anything for them, but just can’t afford the last minute hotel fees for what we saw. We plan to come over a few times a day while we’re gone so we can check on food and especially water"
"77584, south Pearland.  Still no power.  Just kill me already, but get my family outta here first."
77070. Grant and jones. Day 4 no power.
"77012, in between 610 and lawndale. Still no power. I noticed 3 downed poles/wires laying across where old Galveston road starts from Broadway. I have a feeling it’ll be a good while. The hood gets no love lol."
77498 - Still no power. I'm worried for my in-laws in this heat and humidity
"77084, Barker Cypress & 529, Northglen sub. No power. Yesterday, I got a message from Centerpoint that repairs in my area had been completed. Got home and found that there was still no power. My power went out Monday morning at 5. Running a generator at bare minimum with a couple fans to circulate air. 

What's frustrating is about 3 blocks west of my house, some houses have electricity. The map Centerpoint created is a waste of time and resources if they aren't actually giving us timelines. Will I get power today, or am I one of those that won't get it til Sunday?? Entergy (power for other parts of SETX) provided their residents with an actual time line of when areas will have restored power."
"77469/77479 - 59/99 area. Most neighborhoods in the immediate area seem to have gotten power back yesterday and most stores look like they’re opening back up. HEB at river park and bucees on crabb river have been open for 2 days so should be getting relatively back to normal. Parts of Rosenberg and the front half of my neighborhood got their power back the day before, so I’m thinking they’re moving north up 59, at least in this area. Lots of cooling centers in fort bend county! Libraries, I believe a building at the fairgrounds is still open 24 hours, several mobile locations were available yesterday. I’ve seen a lot posted on Nextdoor and Facebook so if anyone needs more info on those let me know!!


Edit: power flickered several times around 10:15am then shut off completely 😭 I’m in the tara neighborhood. I heard they’re working on the railroad lines and it will be just a brief interruption, I’m really hoping so. Not sure how many people impacted but it looks like at least my whole neighborhood.


Edit 2: power back on at 1:15pm! I’m thinking they were connecting other parts of our circuit that had more damage."
"77006 - Missouri and Waugh no power since Monday am. CP map says energized, repeatedly online let CP know.  Have lost hope it will get fixed due to the fact it is a small pocket of houses."
"Spent the night in El Campo with the folks.  Bout to head back to be at work at 2.  If I don’t have power back this evening when I get off at 10 (at 77373) driving my ass right back down here.  At least I’m off Fridays/Saturdays so I can spend a couple of days here if need be.

Dealing with a 100m commute from El Campo to North Houston/Spring (one way) is absolutely worth not having to sleep in the heat."
Elderly neighbor's pharmacy is still closed (Walgreens) and they only have a couple days of medication left. Does anyone know if their prescriptions can get filled at another Walgreens? I tried calling a couple and no one is picking up. Thanks
77019 power is on as of yesterday. Wish i could share with everyone here.
"77441 - updated map went from orange to dark green. Yet we do not have power on the entire block. Only the businesses facing 1093, which were restored the day after the storm."

Im at my fathers place in 77581 so idk cross streets but their power is now on

77546 got power
77090 ... How are you all...
"77016 still no power, only know it’s been “assessed”."
77076 neighborhood by parker next to 45. The power restoration is painfully slow. A fourth of my street got power yesterday. Then another fourth today at 1pm. Meanwhile the other half is still out. Trucks left after 1 😭
77049. The map showed it was orange yesterday and blue today but I haven't see any centerpoint truck anywhere near my area. I'm by the showbiz theater.
77024. Still pissed off that the assessment for my neighborhood showed completed yesterday for the whole day and still no power.
"77459 Riverstone - Power hasn’t been on since Monday 6 AM, no flickers & is blue on the Centerpoint map; seen a couple of linesmen trucks around University blvd."
[deleted]
77084 still no power. centerpoint's map is lying. neighborhood is not even partially energized. I offered to get a hotel for my parents and my dad is vehemently refusing it. Right wing garbage he listens to is scaring him that looters are everywhere and he has to defend his castle. Some defense. He didn’t even buy ice until the third day. Guess he like many others didn’t expect it to be this bad. But like.. they’ve lived there so long. I don’t know. I hope they learn lessons from this. I feel sorry for their dog who has to bear the heat.
"77066 just got power back

ETA Southeast corner of Cutten and Bourgeois!"
does anyone have any advice on where to stay with 3 cats? we’re starting to worry they’re overheating

77044 no power yet. 
77076 still nothing
"77023: only house on the block with no power still

Edit: breakers are checked; the meter isn’t actually showing numbers. I called centerpoint because there is a low line that I wasn’t sure was the cause so I went to the emergency route, and when I was speaking to the person I asked what they’re seeing on whatever map they have. They confirmed that my house is not connected/online to the grid

Edit2: **I was driving back home to feed the colony of cats and saw electricians at Dumble and Telephone**

Edit3: **I saw maybe 4 or 5 crews in total today in and around 77023 and nearby zips, most of the crews were concentrated next to UH**"
"77096: No power- CS- S. Braeswood & chimney rock, behind BBQ restaurant & subway"
77090  no power by 45 and richey road
"77004, midtown, 288/McGowen
No power still. Don’t have hope that it’s gonna get fixed anytime soon"
77007-no power. Our apartment building and the majority of the units have power but our units and units on our side of the building are apparently on a different transformer.
"77002 - water and internet back on. I’m near Bagby/Grey. Surrounding area seems to have power as well. 

Message me if you need to charge phones."
77012 here. Hit 72 hours without power at our house and the in laws. We’re getting out of town at this point. Hope the internet works when power comes back so we can know it’s good to return. Hoping for the best for everyone. We deserve better.
77056. Still not yet. Half of the neighborhood got it 2 days ago. And I have to go to work where also has no AC.
77018 near 32nd and Yale. No power but 31st and 33rd streets have power and it’s really frustrating. There’s a massive tree down that’s been blocking the road near Yale and they haven’t even began to cut it up. Finally saw a crew out yesterday that appeared to be assessing the damage then they left.
"77459
1092 and Cartwright - no power :("
"77007- near Cleaveland Park, no power since ~8AM Monday."
77070 My half of the complex still doesn't have power and my parents who live in Glencairn in 77084 just lost theirs after having it back Tuesday. No word on when it's going to be back up. 
"77074/ south of HBU/HCU, beechnut and Fondren. Still no power, genny started spewing gas last night. Found a place to repair the 15 year old bastard my parents bought for Ike. I’m so happy about the repair I can’t be upset about still not having power. That’ll change by the time I go out to get gas again"
77069–no power

"77396 Humble, electricity and internet still out, but my mom can finally call people. T-Mobile service is still spotty, she can't use internet data and can still only text me and no one else, but she can at least call people. 

I am curious what causes this semi-service for a mobile service."
"77025, CP has assigned a team to work in the area but yet to be dispatched. Hopefully TODAY 🤞🏽🤞🏽"

"77072 just got power last night 7/10 
77082 power came on 7/8 9pm"
"the majority of 77035 appears to be back on as of an hour ago or so.
Did they re-energize half the city at the same time? 
Seems like there’s a lot of us who all got power at exactly the same time. 🤷‍♂️ 
Still worried about my mother in 77068. Lots of pine tees out there and they always get hit the worst. 
At least she can come here now 😐 yay"
"We were supposed to have it back by midnight. Still nothing. 


77070 Cypresswood and Cutten "
Question: would you participate in an MMA sanctioned bout versus Centerpoint CEO?
"Power came on for about two minutes and went back off, should I feel hopeful it’s coming back soon??"
Any update on 77007 near Jackson Hill and Feagan? ♡ thank you

Does anyone know if the Specs on Memorial has power? The door was boarded up. Did it get looted?
77040 we up
77354 - Just heard from my neighbor that power just came back on!
"Updates: governors itinerary is going to be announced sometime, pace of repairs expected to slow down next week as linemen get tired from 16 hour days working many in a row, next Thursday is tentative estimate for final restorations, but areas requiring precision and attention may remain, CenterPoint response going to be investigated,"
"77045 fannin no power
Wish I could get a hold of centerpoint to ask for an ETA"

77045 - almeda. No power yet still. The map shows our area is energized but we see a power line on the ground outside our neighborhood so… might be a while ugh. House was 89 deg when we went to check yesterday and grab more things. Thankful we have a somewhere to stay with our baby and pets.
77578 - got power back last night. It flicked off a few times but now seems to be holding steady.
"77521, Baytown. 62 hours without power, if my math is math. Line is down right next to my house due to fallen tree bits.

I got about three hours of sleep on a metal bench in my garage this morning. I'm still tired, but now I'm also sore and stiff! Thank goodness! 

Woke up in the garage about 630am to the sound of someone banging on something. Jumped up all excited, ""it's Center Point finally""! Nah, my neighbor is tapping a piece of rebar on the concrete or something, nobody is here to fix my power. 

Might drive into town so I can go by my work and charge my junk, and sit in the AC, but that doesn't help my pets at all."
"77060 off airline and west, finally got power last night. I wish everyone the best of luck getting power back and making it through this horrible situation."

"77055 half our street is still missing power. I’m one of the lucky ones. Hosted my neighbors in my game room last night, happy I was able to share the AC wealth."
"77573 League City. Still no power. I've seen bucket trucks around the neighborhood. Maybe like 7, but since some of us have power and some don't we probably not high on the priority list. TNMP map feels like it hasn't updated at all"
"77339 Kingwood, Forest Cove

It's fucked. There's a downed pine tree over wires and a snapped pole behind Metro Self Storage off of Kingwood Drive. Don't think a Centerpoint truck has even come out to see it. Feeling like we'll be some of the very last to get power back

Straight up not having a good time, yo. I want to run for the hills but I have nowhere to run to"
"77021 - MLK & Yellowstone. Still orange on the map, haven't seen any trucks."

"Montie Beach/Brookesmith 77009

No power. No hope."
77054 no power but seems like everyone else in the zip does have power. North end towards OST/288. Our neighborhood and the gas stations on OST dont have power but the apartment building down the street the other way has power
"For those that are looking at the map, is there a time reference for when you turned blue to when you got your power back? I’m trying to watch for my cousins places, they were all orange last night but as of this morning, it so flipped to blue.

Edit: ok thanks y’all, I’m just gonna tell them to pack up and leave for the weekend. Thank you again!"
77389 no power since Monday 7am
77015 (North Shore) still no power for my street.
"77089, Sagemeadow along Blackhawk. No power since Monday, but my area is blue on the outage map now, and I saw some crews working in my area. Possibly power today or hopefully by tomorrow"
"77042, saying power may come back by end of day Saturday. I really hope that’s not the case 😭"
"77489, hunters green, nothing still."
"Anyone know if the DPS office Southeast on Galveston Road is open tomorrow? The Centerpoint map shows they don't have power, but I got a text confirming my appointment. Fingers crossed I won't have to be rescheduled, since it took me weeks to get a Friday appointment."
I'm guessing the workers going to stop  when the rain starts!
"Yall should be asking questions on r/lineman for power related issues. 

Also, someone needs to be asking centerpoint why they’re arguing wages AND why they didn’t contact every available contractor in the country. I know of multiple large contractors who were not contacted despite having manpower, equipment, and solid safety records"
" we regained power yesterday. Still no xfinity wifi. I'm genuinely curious when that'll return. Based on what I can find, it'll return when other nearby areas regain power. But I'm wfh sooo, rip :/."
77339- still no power. My generator and battery powered fans are life savers right now.
"77035 -  Blue all day, and just turned to orange. FML"
77040 around Hollister and Tidwell just got power! Fingers crossed that it stays on.
"77035 near the Home Depot, still waiting. Thermostat still rising. 

On a positive note, it’s nice to see HPD out for a change. 
Guess they finally got bored shooting at acorns and hyperventilating over fentanyl exposure. 

Real heroes those guys, back the blue 👍😐"
77043 Spring Branch. My power is back! Still haven’t seen a single electrical truck but I guess I shouldn’t question it.
"Power restored on giant apartment complex located on 7575 Office City Drive. 77012. Power arrived around 4:15pm. For what it's worth, earlier today, I did get an email from Center Point stating that the power around this region would be restored by tomorrow Friday. The message also did said that the power could be restored earlier, so that gave me a bit of hope. But now I wait, as I see others say their power gets cut off after a few hours or so. Just reporting from my perspective."
"77396.  No power.  A few houses across the street have it but not us.  I have a son with medical needs and I am nervous the more it goes on.  Hey-but the mayor and Lt Gov are mad too guys, from their air conditioned homes"
"77007 East 9th in the heights no power since 9:20 am Monday. According to Centerpointle$$ colorblind test map, they're still ""assessing."""

77011 (Lockwood and navigation)our building has partial power no water and our neighbors seen to all have power but our apartment building... Does it mean we won't get fixed till Friday?
77034. No power since 5:30am Monday. Parents live in senior apartments. Things are rough there. Some are trapped because the elevators don’t work. No water also

"77536 Deer Park 

Power is still out in sections. 

Line trucks are still working in the area.


Edit.  77536 

Got power back in Deer Park in one of the areas closest to Spencer.

Lineman are working in the area in high volume. 

Deer Park had power near Shell Federal that went down temporarily to change out a pole near the school. 

I'm thinking Deer Park may be restored throughout tomorrow."
77346 - No power. Some subdivisions around us are slowly getting power.
"77346 near west lake houston- no power. 

But I did see trucks yesterday afternoon. I don’t know what they did. But there were a lot of them."

77386. Still no power.
"77053, still out. Half the neighborhood has power but my little street does not. Absolute envy."
"77003, near Rusk and Paige. We never lost power, but everyone around us did. Yesterday, The Green Bone doggie day care and the townhouses got power back. I drove around this morning on the way to work, and saw power as far as Nancy’s Hustle and EaDo Vet."
77346 west lake houston near 1960. Trucks spotted. Trucks have been spotted. Again.
"77034 - near Gulf Palms Park. No power. Hopefully trash day for black and tree as we got that all taken care of yesterday. There is a fridge worth in that black bin today *sigh*

In vetter news we had a guy canvassing the neighborhood and the backyards looking for downed trees, so at least there is movement in my area and hopefully that means things will be up today, but I admit. Ike scarred my ass and I am not expecting it."
"77025 - heart breaking end of day yesterday - 12 bucket trucks showed up on my street around 3. They worked me neighborhood's lines for about 4-5 hours, cleared some tree debris, but did not succeed in getting power back on. Another sweaty night trying to sleep."
77077 no xfinity
"77008 N Main and W Cavalcade 

Been in the lavender/blue region since the map was released. Still no power."
"Good morning everyone! How accurate is the CenterPoint smart meter? If the status is showing ON, does it mean we have power?

We are asking bc our security app is showing no power, but that could be an internet issue (Xfinity is down)."
"77009 - Norhill. Still no power. 


Husband ran out to get gas yesterday and had to try five different gas stations. Did eventually find gas at Main and Houston. HEB was fine, though. He picked up a couple cases of sparkling water."

"77346 got power at 730pm, though it flickered once"

77494 area by buccees power back on
77045 - still no power
"77055, Antione and Westview. Thankfully was only without power for Tues (my heart is out there for those without) but the Xfinity internet has kept going up and down at random since, and off all day. This wasn't even set off by another storm to my knowledge, though the site said it was do to weather damage.

Losing it here, need the internet to work and my phone as Hotspot isn't enough for this long. Do we have any idea when this will be fixed??"
77092 - Pinemont/Antoine.  No power.
77025 huge staging of workers at NRG this morning. First I’ve seen in this area. Hopefully good news for Braeswood/Med Center/Linkwood/South Main today
[deleted]
"77023 Leeland & Ernestine - No power yet. We were in orange on the map and now we’re light green “partially energized”. Taking all this with a grain of salt, probably false hope, but at this point I’ll take anything 🤷🏻‍♀️"
Has anyone that has been in the light green gotten power? We are one of a few houses in our neighborhood without power and wondering if there’s any chance we will get it back sooner rather than later
Power back in Oak Forest Nina Lee b/w Rosslyn and Donna Bell around noon today
77091 - any luck on power today?
"https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-announces-snap-wic-replacement-benefits-for-counties-impacted-by-recent-severe-weather

Had been added to the megathread."
"77006 blessed with power but cursed with xfinity. For some reason had internet yesterday but it died overnight and no messages from them… assuming that centerpoint needs to fix before they can even touch it, so wondering if that means internet will be off for a few days at least :("
77066 - Bourgeois and Cutten. I’m out of town but husband and son are home. I feel so guilty that they don’t have power and I do. I feel helpless. We do have solar and the batteries charge everyday but I’m concerned about today since it’s cloudy. I know they have it better than many as well.  I feel like those in power are using this hurricane as a political stunt and there will be lots of pointing fingers at everyone while the city suffers.
77024 - still nothing at Memorial and 610. We’re still in the Orange tier.
Any update on Xfinity?
"77080 blalock and long point, map is one of the few areas that is ‘fully energized’ lol, I don’t see anyone with power"
77346- no power stillllll
Anyone in 77021 gain and retain power? Website says I have power but I do not have power. Reported it three times but still saying I have power.
77087. By Northdale and Bellfort. No power. Had it for a moment last night and then…back to darkness.
77058 - east Pearland. No power and centerpoint is sending morale boosting texts about how other areas need to be prioritized 🫠
"77075: Blackhawk and Beltway with no power still. Some areas are getting power, so hopefully, soon, we will as well."
No power in 77095 near 529 and Queenston. all surrounding areas have power except my subdivision
Can someone please keep me posted on 77035? I’m in an area with poor service overall
No Power at 77389 Londonderry Subdivision Spring🫠
"Gonna check back later tonight, everyone be resilient"
77043 no power in half of spring shadows subdivision. Most of Gessner has no power. We got a portable generator last night at Lowes. Line was long and had to call several stores to find gas cans. Actually slept with fans last night which was a reprieve from the oppressive humidity. We're right at the edge of blue/green on the Centerpoint map.
"77586 Street lights powered on last night, but that was false hope still no power. "
"77047, City Park area. West side of 288 along Orem has power. East side homes (Skyview Park and City Gate) have no power still. However, I believe that homes further north on Airport Blvd. (Grand West) does have power on the east side.

Businesses (Starbucks, Chipotle, Whataburger, etc) are generally all open regardless."
"77076 northline, nothing on my side but houses in front of us got there light yesterday"
77095 no power.
Updated with additional information at the bottom for shelters and food distribution
"77536 Deer Park area, no power still sigh.. every thing around us is up and running"
77459
77082 westchase half of apartment has power the other half doesn't (including my building) everything around seems to have power as well
Pinemont and N Shepherd still without power. Finally saw a tree being cut and removed from a line but there are multiple in that grid. Map says the 17th restoration date 😭
Here I am at 77028 where everyone around me has power except for my neighborhood… the map shows no ETA for me. What in the world?! It’s been 7 days and I have to wait 7 more?!?!?!?!? Dude I’m going to file for bankruptcy from this. Ridiculous.
77346. My folks
"77087 still no power along a certain side of 610. 

Fiesta on mykawa is open with a generator and churches chicken is open. The bank is as well if any of your needs can be done here instead of heb"
77024 just woke up still no power
[deleted]
Did anyone who was knocked out by the storm get power back?
I guess the situation is worse this time than the derecho bc the downed power lines are more widespread.
Just got this text: “From your CenterPoint COPE Team: Power cuts in your area are anticipated to be extended into next week. Customers are encouraged to cope with it. On Day 7-9 it is easier to cope than on Days 1-3. For meaningful tips on how to cope visit CenterPoint.com”
Dang Beryl Baskins!
"77077, I didn’t loose power. Had power since July 8th. However, some parts I know in this area are still out."
Why are people waiting in line for hours for bottled water? There is nothing wrong with the water. It comes out of the tap fine. What a waste of resources. Bottled water is also terrible for the environment. What am I not understanding?
[removed]
77007 Washington/sawyer.  Never lost power. Never suffered.
"Ouch. Allegedly one of Abbotts stops was going to be very close to where that deputy was killed, but it’s been changed because of optics. That’s horrible, it would have brought them a lot of needed attention and resources. Not a troll post, either. Ouch. They’re still making his schedule and trying to figure out how much rest time he may want or need when he gets back to Texas. International travel in a wheelchair is, believe it or not, quite tiring and the governor is not relishing the thought of immediately getting dropped into a series of multi day pressers in a recovering disaster zone despite his otherwise extremely strong desire to be on the ground here with the community."

"77098, near Buffalo Speedway and Richmond. No power since ~ 5 am Monday. Seems like literally everyone else around our complex has power but us. Such a tease seeing the big ass buildings on greenway with power and being so empty right now, would love their AC. Feels like I haven’t slept in days."
Please reread the OP throughout the day as I try to update with new information as it comes in.
“I have power and air conditioning” is an extremely effective pickup line right now.
"Be sure to make use of our newest flair, Fuck Centerpoint™️"
"Does anyone know if the names of the deceased are released? I was following a homeless person on this sub and they’ve been MIA since the storm. Tried reaching out and nothing. They really tugged at my heart strings and I wanted to help them out but couldn’t reach them in time.

https://www.reddit.com/u/domdomtakdom/s/sBvdZdRM38

This is the user and I’ve been so concerned about them :("
77096 - still nothing. Waking up and realizing your power didn’t come back on is such a shitty feeling 😣
Ravioli ravioli give me the poweroli
It's probably cooler outside than inside atm if you don't have power. I opened my window and it feels so good. Just make sure if you're running a generator it's not exhausting near the window
[deleted]
"I think people would be more understanding if CenterPoint communicated better. 

I signed up for the ""alerts"" and only got 1 alert asking me to Reply 1 for alert? And that was 2 days ago. 

The outage map is confusing and incorrect at best. 

CenterPoint crapped the bed with Beryl."
"Suggestion for next thread name: Beryl-ly any progress

Don’t forget to update your user flair."
"ABC news reporting 400k homes could be without power past Sunday. Leave town if you can, don’t gamble. I did and do not regret that decision."
"And remember, kids, don't fully restock your fridge with groceries until all this stabilizes."
"I will say this has taught me an important lesson about myself, which is that I would sooner sacrifice myself to the zombies than try to survive an apocalypse 🥴"
77479 - no power. I can’t do this again tomorrow it’s too hot. I can’t sleep. I’ve got work deadlines.
"Don't trust Centerpoint numbers. According to them my subdivision got power back on yesterday around 6 pm, and that's a lie!! 
All my neighbors have reported the outage again and we still show in their website with power on. 🙄🙄🙄

Have I mentioned today how much I hate Centerpoint (not you linemen, I love you ...but your bosses suck)."
Did centerpoint even work last night? I haven't seen anyone get power overnight.  This is so sad
"Wow fuuu my company made me burn the 2 PTO days I wasn't able to work. They entered them ""for me"" to ""help me out"""
Anyone else feeling a weird sadness about how few people checked in on you? 
how on earth is progress so much slower today than yesterday
"77007 Studemont/Washington. No power since Monday around 3 AM. 

My apartment is 80 and muggy ° (im glad its not worse) and my poor senior cat is miserable. I tried to get a flight for us home and it was going to be $800+. No family here, no one close enough that I would ask to allow me and my cat. Not leaving without her, obviously. Over 300 dollars worth of food spoiled. 

Frustration turned to anger turned to absolute fucking rage."
Hello darkness my old friend
"At the rate these repairs are going we are gonna have

Megathread: day 28. Beryly alive"
77077. Blue. No power. Melting.
"According to the centerpoint outage tracker, the number of affected customers has increased over the last 5 hours. Also, the color coded map they published is unchanged for the several miles around my neighborhood"
Hahahaha Centerpoints progress has ground to a halt so they stopped showing the last 24 hours stats so we don’t see the precipitous drop and replaced it with restorations since the storm. Got to make sure you keep the homes that lost power due to precautionary shutoffs to juice those stats.
Looks like it’s another 6 pack on the porch staring at the apartment complex 100 feet away from me with power kind of night
"The closest experience we’ve had here in terms of a wind event was Ike, and the majority of people were out of power for a full week including myself. At the time I lived in 77098. 

For areas with more trees like my parents in champion forest, they were out for two full weeks. 

Centerpoint has given me no reason to believe they have gotten better at this in the last 15 years. If anything, they seem less capable. 

I think it was a mistake to not just be realistic about what people should expect, unless they were trying to avoid panic buying and other secondary effects. 
But the idea that half of us would be restored by tomorrow never seemed plausible to me. 

I would encourage everyone to at least get mentally and emotionally prepared for the fact that we may be without power through the weekend, or longer. 🤷‍♂️"
Don’t know how accurate their restoration tracker numbers are but only 9k restoration from 11pm to 6 am. Wtf. Centerpoint is the worst
Why do some idiot drivers NOT STOP at broken traffic lights!? Driving me mad!

"77034.  I swear it was on for maybe a few seconds.  Enough to spin up my ceiling fan.  

Or there is a huge gas leak and I am tripping balls."
"If you have limited cell or internet service, we will be updating this link that's easier to load throughout the day with outage news updates: [https://www.texastribune.org/text/DvVHvcXY/](https://www.texastribune.org/text/DvVHvcXY/)

"What a beautiful sight to behold as I was driving by about half an hour ago on Louetta Road, between Kuykendahl and Ella—White trucks working on power lines!"
Houston transplants we tried to warn you it sucks living in the swamp!!
"Well, finally had to make a decision on the freezer.  Spent the morning barbecuing what meat I had left in the freezer (1.5lb of pork belly, a couple links of sausage, about 2 dozen chicken wings, small package of chicken thighs, a couple of top sirloin steaks, and a rack of baby backs).  

Brought it into work to feed my co-workers, so at least it won’t go to waste.  

The one benefit of being single and living alone is that I don’t have to overstock of groceries.  That was about maybe $50-70 worth.  So not that bad of a loss."
"I could understand if it was slow yesterday bs aside. Basically they spend yesterday getting a thorough assessment + doing some of the easier fixes. 

But today being this slow is just insanity. 

Then again they said they were confident reaching 1m fixed by end of day today which means they were expecting roughly 150k customers being fixed today. Which is such a slow pace"
"77007, no power and going by the useless fucking map CenterPoint put up - They haven't even started accessing the damage."

Houston's sound of summer is cicadas and the humming of generators.

"I havent seen Houston in this state of despair. I went out this morning and NOTHING was open. People were fighting over gas in the few gas stations that were open. There is no streetlights which makes crazy traffic and drivers. Grocery stores and restaurants all dark and closed. Debri from the storm everywhere. No sign of trucks working to restore lights.  People sitting outside of homes and apartments because its just too hot indoors.      

 I also saw a line of about 150ish people sweating it out in the sun to fill up propane tanks. It feels 3rd world out here 💀"
"77009 near N Main/I45 .  Power still out.  Red lights on major intersections still out.  Set up the generator last night.  Got one windows unit running.  It makes such a difference.


@u/justahoustonpervert don't you have Tesla power walls?  How are those doing?"
77388. Between Louetta and Cypresswood. No power. 90 degrees in the house.
"77380 - no power, orange on centerpoint map. Slept with wet towels as blankets until my battery backup was drained from my fan. Charging that hoe in my car rn. Luckily my air mattress is waterproof. Hungry, tired, sick of this shit. Was supposed to start new job on Monday, thankfully the bossman isn't making me do anything until the office has power but I'm bored as fuck with shitty cell service 

77469 - no power, orange on centerpoint map"
77459. No power. I love this city but man this shit has me coveting other places.
"77077 energy corridor. 48 hours with no power. I took melatonin and NyQuil last night and could barely sleep. My sheets are sweaty and gross and I cannot wash them.

T-mobile signal has been spotty the entire time. I’m getting data right now while inside my apartment which is unusual. I usually have to go outside to get data. SMS and iMessage having weird issues leading to communication problems with friends, colleagues, and my out of state family who are worried about me. This sucks."
"I’m boutta start swinging if I have to go through another hot, sweaty, dark ass night while seeing the houses across the street have power since Monday"
"77562/77521

Day 3. Darkness prevails as all signs of power seem far away... All hope is gradually failing... The end is near.  

Real talk. This is planet bullshit. Centerpoint needs to get their heads out of their asses. I know the linemen are working as hard as they can, and I appreciate them, but something needs to be done about Centerpoint. They now want us to pay for the damages and restorative costs.  They fuck straight on off."
"As someone who used to work fast food I'm kinda surprised at the amount of people waiting in line at these establishments.

Y'all these low wage college aged kids are not checking meat temperatures from that industrial freezer/refrigerator. They more than likely just walked in there shrugged their shoulders and said ""fuck it lets just serve what we got"" despite the meat not being cold for over 48 hrs lol"
I FINALLY GOT THROUGH TO CENTERPOINT'S EMERGENCY PHONE LINE!! HOLD TIME WAS 10 MINUTES THIS MORNING.
These guys are working very slowly. It's been stuck in the 1.3m outage range since like 6 am.
Anyone else see the restoration counter on the outage tracker just jump from 985k to 1 mill mere minutes before the 5 pm deadline? Can't make this shit up.
"Just got power at 77070 by Tomball Parkway. The CP map still shows our area as Under Assessment so it’s not reliable. 

Any area could have power at any moment so hang in there guys, gals, non-binary pals!"
Well they finally posted that the map is not up to date. Took them long enough to put that disclaimer.
"I used to not get overly stressed or anxious… almost ever.   I still don’t really.. with one exception.  Dealing with these weather events that we’ve had over the past couple of years has made any sort of weather an absolute trigger for me.   

This was a hurricane… I get it, but when as the derecho earlier this year, or the strong storms North Houston got last June it seems we can never be certain wether a simple line of thunderstorms is gonna fuck us for days or weeks at a time. It’s as mentally draining as the heat is physically draining."
Going on 60+ hours of no power is just soul crushing. Even if it was broken up it would be better than having to suffer like this
"77429. Power came back on for a moment and our whole street lit up,  then a loud BOOM, then we lost power again. Now our neighbors across the street have power and we're back in the hot damp dark for probably several more days. And literally across the street they have power."
"77429 no power, internet and very limited cell service. 48 hours and counting. Lost all the groceries in the fridge, the house smells like trash and ass. We are sticky and sour. I know everyone without power feels this way…but this sucks SO hard."
For the outage tracker they removed every statistic except for the number of customers affected..
"77018 31st and North Loop. CenterPoint just sent a text saying our lights are on and my neighbor confirmed that was a lie! 

Had a baby Saturday and have yet to go home. 😐"
"77008, we're back baby!"
I really feel for the line workers and customer service folks at Centerpoint. They’re bearing the brunt of the anger and frustration that should really be levied at company leadership and those that are supposed to be giving them oversight.
"How are y'all doing mentally? I really want to cry right now. The heat, lack of sleep, and general stress are doing a number on me right now."
"#centerpoint be like ""1M restored. Mission Accomplished"" 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡"
77584 South Pearland.  Power still out.  Neighborhood LOUD AF with generators.  I am 2 miles from PHS where they had the out of town centerpoint help.  Wonder if they're still just parked there.  82F downstairs.
"77379 - Hour 52 of no power with two elderly parents in tow.

Went from our home in Klein all the way to Dayton to find ice yesterday. It's mostly melted today.

Mom has pretty bad sleep apnea, so at this point I'm just praying she wakes up every morning.

I'm tired."
"77477 - Stafford, The Grid area, going on day 3 with no power, all businesses around still dark. Walmart on W Airport Blvd seems to be open."
77008 we just lost power again. We got power back around 11 and now it's off again.
Remember to check the licenses of anyone you hire for work on your property. There will be people out taking advantage and you want to know they are properly accredited. The plumbers union is aleady getting reports of fraudulent contractors.
"Even with CP inflating their restored customers number they only restored around 130k customers so far today, which leaves 1.2 million left sitting in the dark for the time being."
"77096, still no power and extremely afraid I’ll be a part of that 350,000 that Centerpoint said they’d want to restore by the end of SUNDAY. Like come on."
77007 Durham and Washington. No power and no water
"77477 Stafford Run area still without power.

About to say screw this and move back out of state. The state has repeatedly demonstrated a lack of competency in caring for its citizens and my mental health is worth more than whatever this city can offer me."
"77037 Regarding the color coded map that they posted, is anybody else in the green but still without power?"
I’m going out of town on a planned vacation tonight but I feel very guilty leaving my folks in all this mess. Ugh
"My mom got a message from centerpoint saying to expect to be out of power for several days, 77011. But we know people in our zip code have power is this a generic message."
77077 still dark. I can’t take much more of this
Hitting that time again. It's probably cooler outside than inside atm if you don't have power. Open a window! Just make sure if you're running a generator it's not exhausting near the window. Be careful.
ARE OUR INDOOR CATS OK IN A 85-90 DEGREE HOUSE??
My place got power at 7PM after gruel some 60 hours and i just had a very long shower and made a nice meal for myself. Life is happening again. My heart goes out to families that still are in the dark. Hang in there. Just a day or two more.
77057- I’m over this :( I have fur babies. I just want my AC back so they don’t have to be warm :(
77018 North Loop and 31st power was restored about 12:45pm!! Finally.
Feeling depressed I don't want to go through another night with no power I have work I can't clean my uniform or take a shower. I can't book a room with no availability and I can't leave town. I feel like a trapped rat. 77011
Of the last 60 days I have not had power 11% of the time. I have power now and I feel incredibly guilty.

77054 - Holly Hall day 3 no power… 💀

Edit: power back up 1024hrs"

77070 1960 perry/greencreek area nothing yet but a neighborhood behind us is up :/ a tree laying on lines on mills rd/perry still
77375 - I'm so fucking pissed off rn.
77012; still no power but the corner store and one street have power near me. Learned today that smoke detectors can go off if humidity is over 85%
"77018- garden oaks, still no power. Took my dog to daycare today just to give her a break from the heat. I’m so grateful they’re open and have power!! 

I’m a little worried about my senior kitty in this heat, though. Texting my vet to see what she recommends, I’ll update this comment when she gets back to me bc I know a lot of us with cats are worried."
Crazy how some parts of Briar Forest have power and others dont. LIke right next to each other. How the fuck those this grid work.
"to anyone in the 77070 area, the willowbrook mall just opened up if you need some ac and sit down for a while."
77008 24th and Shepherd just got power back
77070 willowbrook area and still nothing
"Kind reminder, don’t forget to clean your refrigerator! Don’t wait until it becomes nasty 🤢"
Centerpoint miraculously hits their goal of 1 million restored on the outage tracker before midnight tonight and they're gonna call it a victory.
"77511 Alvin, no power, we were able to get running water! Yay showers!!"
"77095 still no power, had to go to work this morning, only got 2 hours of sleep, fuck this"
"77009. This color coded map is BS, Center point. My street is orange at the end and green all around us, yet every house is without power still."
"77003 - navigation & Nagle 

No power still. I heard Eado edge got power yesterday so hopefully not much longer"
77007 - still no power (Jackson Hill Rd)
"77047. Power came back on for a split second, then turned off followed by the sound of a popping transformer 😕"
77406 (Pecan Grove) - We finally got power after 3 days
77066 - Willowbrook I’m in Japan but husband and son are home. Still no power.
77035 Westbury. My house is an oven and I’m an over cooked bratwurst.
Just saw about 20 trucks heading into the kingwood area
"Just got a picture from family that centerpoint trucks are staged in Fort Bend. Trying not to get too hopeful

Edit: Quail Valley in Missouri City. There is a Centerpoint truck currently at the memory assisted living facility on FM 1092 and Hampton for anyone with family there"
anyone in the 77077 Westheimer/Kirkwood area seeing trucks or positive signs?  got a message last night at 7pm that trucks were working in my area but the map shows my zone as orange
Wife just got off the phone with center point and apparently no one has called them to tell them it is a transformer with down lines as the issue. Also they said it was about 7 people affected by it so I’m guessing we’re at the end of the line
What’s the latest someone has had their power turn on? I’d like to know when to stop caring for the day.
"I wish there was a Houston ""bored out of our minds"" chess group so we could play some games with each other on our phones on lichess or chess.com apps. I'm not very good, but I have been enjoying playing lately. It's definitely something to distract from the madness and the heat.

It's been tough for me because I honestly want a drink so bad. I used to be an alcoholic. I didn't drink after the derecho. And I've vowed not to let this drive me to drinking. And I don't think it will. But God damn a cold beer just seems like the greatest thing right about now. 

I'm settling for warm Topo Chico I guess. At least I have a way to charge my phone. I know a lot of people don't have that."

Centerpoint tracker has barely moved an inch today
It honestly feels like they’ve forgotten about us at this point and it’s making me want to move out of this city as soon as possible.
"Saw at least a hundred lineman trucks just parked in the empty lot at westheimer and fountainview on my way home around 5:30. 

I want to be optimistic that maybe they’re the night crew just waiting to head out for work, but I have only seen like 2 or 3 trucks actually out working since Monday.  

It’s hard to not feel like centerpoint is completely overwhelmed, unable to delegate effectively, and just pretending to be busy. 🫤

Also, 77035 (Westbury) is still approximately 85-95% without power from what I’m seeing"
77006. No power. Saw a centerpoint truck parked a block down from me but the guys stayed in their truck. They left 10 hrs ago…
"77459 Missouri City. No power since Monday 7AM. I borrowed a generator to keep the food from spoiling but not enough to cool the house. We slept in cars at Walmart last night. If we don’t have power by 1pm, we’re going to a motel. Many neighborhoods nearby already have power."
"77062. We lost power 5am on Monday. Still no power. Frustrating when it feels like everywhere around us has power, even other houses on the far side of the neighborhood."
"77064. I'm at work. Apparently they never lost power but the A/C is sketchy. There's a neighborhood down the street without power but I think the water treatment plant that they built the past few years is a high priority spot. Charging everything I can and freezing water bottles for my bunnies 

77066  no power since 715 am Monday."
"It seems like the Sugarland area has more outages than yesterday.

Still haven't seen a centerpoint energy truck in my area"
Lol now the tracker is all “customers restored since Beryl”
"77505 Pasadena/La Porte area.  Line trucks staging at First Baptist Church on Fairmont/Red Bluff.  Hopefully a good sign for those of us in this area.

Also a large staging area at the Target on 646 in Dickinson for those with TNMP.  

Still no power for me in 77586."
"77065, we have power now"
I hope numbers is open Friday I will need the catharsis
77007 any updates near Cleaveland park?
Centerpoint changed their dumbass map from “circuits assigned for repair” to “assessment complete” what a joke of a company
"The Centerpoint CEO makes $37M/yr, eat absolute shit fellow peasants we're never getting power back.

My California transplant neighbors are absolutely freaking out about this storm. His wife is yelling at him he just asked me for a cigarette even though he doesn't smoke
"they didn’t restore a single zip code overnight, did they? lol. guillotine."
"77494, kingsland blvd and cane island pkwy - no power since monday 07/08 ~5am"
77389 no power. i thank god for the slight cool breeze i was given when I opened up my windows after about 11pm. have gotten about 5 hours of sleep since monday 😃
77007 No power! Rice Military at Memorial and Jackson Hill
I feel like the Squidward watching everyone else have fun meme because I’m one of 3 buildings without power in my apartment complex while all the rest have them 🥲
77354 - Magnolia. Day 3 no power and no information on restoration timeline
"77379 Spring Klein area. No power, but the HEB at Louetta & Stuebner Airline seems to have had power since yesterday morning."
77006 off bagby and tuam have power. We were one of two houses on our street that didn’t get fixed yesterday afternoon. They fixed it this morning
Any updates on 77007. by Jackson Hill and Feagan? Any signs of things getting fixed?
"Is the notification below from Centerpoint worth anything in terms of expecting power back soon?

""Crews are still working on repairs at or near [my address]"""
"77469 - got a ""several more days"" text maybe 5 hours ago, power back on as of right now"
"77586 is showing promising signs.  Trucks are staged at Clear Lake Park, the trees laying on downed lines in El Lago magically disappeared over the past couple hours, and I just saw a line truck working over on Kirby.  I'm hopeful we will see restoration soon, but I've been a fool so far.

I should also add that I've not seen a single Centerpoint truck down here.  All the companies have been from Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas and Indiana.  Embarrassing.  I feel like all the out of town workers had to get here before Centerpoint started mobilizing."
77379 Still no power. It's been out since Monday 7:15 am. So ready for this to be over. Edit: also does it not seem like the outage map has updated at all? I thought it was supposed to update at 8 but I haven't been able to discern any differences.
77077 Kirkwood and Westheimer. Nothing yet

"Updates seemed to have dried up, giving up hope of getting power tonight... 77011 by Lockwood and navigation"
"77075 near Beltway 8 - Power came on since 7 PM. Outage map still shows orange but counting literally any blessings at this point, even if it shuts off"
"The new homeowner flex will not be if your home never lost power, but how high up the priority list are you that your power was back on within 48 hours"
"77479 - Sugar Land, no power, no Internet, poor cell where even text messages were not going through, stores out of ice, gas stations out of unleaded gas, time to find somewhere else to live!!!  Where is all the help?  People are suffering."
"Re: Generators, I have the firman three fuel from Costco and the oil change is every 100 hours of operation after you do the initial one at 24 hours.  Figure I’d share so people are doing oil changes every day and polluting more than they have to."
Omg! My power just came back on 77030. I could cry I’m so happy 🥹
I’m starting to think all the utility trucks are just decoys giving us false hope
"I know many are in the same boat so there’s no use in complaining about it but I am genuinely about to lose my mind. Apartment complex not even 100 feet from me has power, bar 3 blocks away from me has power, taco spot one block over has power. What the actual fuck"
77004 still no power. Didn't see any linemen near my apartment yesterday from 9 AM to 8 PM.
"77006 no power. Turned my generator off for the night since I didn’t want to bug the neighbors, but I was only able to sleep 2-3 hours in the heat. Turned it back on at 5am."
"77009 - Norhill. Power still out but we're green on the Centerpoint map. Reported again to their website that we're still without power. About two blocks over from us has power though, towards Main St. "
"77074, south of HBU/HCU. University still has power but I suspect it’s because of the hospital next door. All the way down beechnut at 59 I can see power for the gas stations but I’m not holding out hope. Fuck Centerpoint"
I’m in 77008 Ella and tc jester area without power since Monday morning. feels like everyone around me has power.  😩
"New info. 

77041-Hope City church is teaming up with Mercy chef and is serving hot food from 9AM-7PM on 5300 W Sam Houston Pkwy N

There are facilities to charge devices as well."
"Anyone have power between W TC Jester and Rosslyn in Oak Forest? The stupid Centerpoint map shows in orange, which means nothing has been done"
"77459. Sienna in Missouri City. We left town ( older people with health issues) so we are watching the CP and Whataburger app. My husband’s company has an office here and is still working.  

I hope everyone who stayed are okay, even though I know it sucks."
"77024, half my neighborhood has power the other half doesn’t. Centerpoint has said an equipment failure has affected 85 of us. I figure we will be some of the last to get fixed."
77375 power just came back
How bad is it to get gas? I still have half tank left wondering if I gotta fight someone for it
77587 - THE CITY OF SOUTH HOUSTON- IS SLOWLY GETTING BACK POWER - ALL THE TRUCKS ARE STATIONED AT MATTHYS ELEMENTARY

"Haven’t seen any of the Yugioh Mythical Beast trucks at Magnolia/Spring/Woodlands…..

My area has been in “circuits scheduled to be repaired” for 2 days now…."
[deleted]
Just going to add to the line that cp’s outage map and systems are garbage. My account shows power off and the map shows me in Orange (just a street over from green so maybe a resolution issue) but I’ve been back with no problems since 7pm yesterday.
So now the outage tracker only shows the number of customers affected….wtf is this shit!!!
"77584 no power. the kroger i work at has power, but no ice unfortunately."
"77379 No power but finally have cell service. Saw a cool thunderstorm cloud a little to the South with lots of lightning, but no rain here."
"77346 lost power 9a Monday. Currently orange on the map. While I get it would suck to have power and lose it again, I wish it were an option. 4-6 good hours of air and freezer running could stop so much food loss and help people make it thru these summer temps"
"77042 (Apartments Between Westheimer and Meadowglen by Wilcrest). No power since 4:30 am on Monday. All surrounding apartments on Walnut Bend Lane (including the stores in the plaza at Westheimer @ Wilcrest - Target, Ross, WholeFoods, Petco, 5 Below, etc)had theirs restored around 8 pm Tuesday but we are still in the dark. It's so sad seeing all the neighbors with electricity while we have to push another day in this heat. Will check into a hotel if power doesn't get restored by 3pm today"
"77036

A lot of homes have power around me..... neighbors literally across the street have power, but we don't. 

I drove home from work last night into my neighborhood and saw so many homes with power but told myself not to get excited cause I had a feeling. :( I'm trying to remain positive and grateful, but I am getting irritated quickly. 

Come on, Centerpoint!"
77070 no power for 3 days. Rode thru my old neighborhood in 77064 and power seems to be on.
Black Rock cafe on westheimer is open and has WiFi according to one of my friends
"77054 Ardmore, Holly Hall - no power"
I'm back at work in 77008 with no power.
Any apps out there that’ll let me know if a gas station has gas?
"77004, midtown by 288/elgin/mcgowen
Still no power, no sight of a work truck either 
I’m sure at this rate it’ll be fixed next week"
77057 augusta & san felipe power back about an hour ago
"Power back on (per my Ring camera suddenly having power) at 77581 (Old Pearland), Lakes at Highland Glen! 😩"
[deleted]
"77007 Cottage Grove - just reported a downed line that was pretty hidden away and I think had gone unnoticed until now. Centerpoint said they’d send a crew ASAP, but we’ll see what happens……"
"No power at 77373 (near Aldine Westfield/Cypresswood) still.  

Staying with the folks all the way down in El Campo tonight:  TBH the 100 min drive from Spring to EC is absolutely gonna be worth a cool night of sleep without anxiety."
"Centerpoint just emailed me and said “Due to the severity of the storm, please continue to be prepared to be without power for several days.“ 

I can’t do this for several more days, please centerpoint figure it ouuuuttttt"
[deleted]
"I wish centerpoint would provide better updates. I have a house in Austin that I could have driven to but stayed here to monitor my fence, roof storm damage. I never expected 50+ hours in this sweltering heat. I have enough gas to get out so I may just leave now. Leave my neighbor the generator I’m sharing with them and go."
I’ve gotten no updates from CenterPoint despite being enrolled to receive their alerts. Oh! But they did send me a message yesterday about my payment being due soon….suck my sweaty balls CenterPoint
[deleted]
tenfold coffee in the heights an absolute godsend this morning. limited operations with a generator — i think i saw a sign that they are open til noon today?  
"Their outage tracker (the counting one, not the lying map) has to be broken. No way has nothing changed for hours. Plus every other time I refresh it hides everything but the ""customers affected"" count."
77056 still without power. I’ve seen 2 Centerpoint Trucks yesterday but not sure what they were doing. I haven’t seen and downed lines it visible damage to equipment in our area. We need better regulations for power companies and a stronger power grid. Have you registered to vote and started your plan to vote?
"77092, still nothing but the houses and buildings across from us got power around 9pm last night so I'm hoping today is the day... this heat is miserable "
"77085 (SW Houston - S. Post Oak & Tidewater Dr) 

This hurricane’s got me fucked up man. Cell service was restored yesterday but there hasn’t been electricity or AC since 6am Monday."
"77071 - no power since Monday ~7 am. We have really good friends that are letting us stay in their guest room so that we have AC and WiFi. And my husband works at TMC so during the day, he’s fine. But who knows when we’ll have power back? Very grateful to have our friends give us support knowing that we would do the same for them in a heartbeat. "
"77081 got a text about power being restored. Came home and it’s shotty at best. I think we have lost a leg of power. Ac won’t run, neither will appliances and lights go out after a few minutes. 

Need gas for my generator. Any gas stations recommendations would be greatly appreciated! 

NOTE!!! If you are having the same issues as me, turn your AC off. It will damage the compressor and motor. 

Hope everyone’s animals and babies are okay. ❤️

Edit: words"
"77007 Rice Military/Wescott 

Still no power, the street behind me has had power for about two days now. We hooked up an inverter to my car, so we have some power, the fridge running and bought a window unit (for the bedroom)."
"77047, East Orem neighborhoods still without power at 8:30 am"
77035. Power went back on on Tuesday 5pm.
Boil water notice? Yes or no?
77506 - no power. That dumb stupid CP energy map is green now. Gtfoh. 😔
77459 by Murphy rd and Ave E I saw center point working by the transformer center. Still no power in Lexington Square
Is it even worth calling centerpoint to ask for an update on my area? 77479 off Eldridge
77077 Kirkwood and Westheimer area. No power in our neighborhood but very close by seems to have power
77077 there’s a downed line on highway 6 right across from the terry hershey parking. Haven’t seen a single CP in the area
"77004, midtown by 288/McGowen. No power since Monday 830 am. Haven’t seen a single Centerpoint truck in all that time. 

I know complexes around me have power and it’s so annoying because I think we’re gonna have to wait more days since I’m pretty sure it’s a transformer issue."
"77388 centerpoints map says that about half of the area has power. My apartment is right next to an energized section, supposedly with crews assigned for repairs. We’ll see"
[deleted]
77092 near 290 & Bingle. No power. Drove to the Wendy’s on Magnum and there are 4 CP trucks in the Houston ISD field house parking lot.
"77469, Richmond-Rosenberg at 52hrs no power. CenterPoint is still “assessing” so basically no power until further notice."
77036 i just got power back
77065 just got power.
"And we are back on the grid
77095 
Longenbaugh / sunny ridge"
Centerpoint map shows I should have power and all houses on my street have power restored except me. What do I do?
"Any news on 77459, Quail Valley area?"
"77373

No power when I left for work around noon.  Map shows me in the blue.. so hopefully by the time I get home…. Maybe?

If not I’m scooping up my cat and driving down to my folks in El Campo when I get off.  They only had about 12hrs of downtime.."
77007 any update?
"77062. I just got power back on, but it still occasionally flickers. Not confident enough to turn my AC breaker back on, nor put the generator away. Having lights, outlets, and ceiling fans is a huge upgrade tho."
"Any updates on 77007 near Jackson Hill & Memorial, the part that’s still orange on the map? Any crews in sight?

I got out of town with my dog, best of luck to those of you who are still in the dark."
"hopefully this works — if yall know any hotels / airbnbs that have electricity and are available, dm please 😭. i just need sleep and to get work done. 

and if you live at 77040, godspeed."
"77043 Spring Branch. Power has been out for 60 hours now (since 5am Monday). We finally did a drive around the area and ohh boyyy…

We have at least seven power poles down in about a four or five block radius, three of which were split in half completely. We didn’t see a single electrical truck and two streets are completely blocked off by fallen trees.

The Centerpoint map says our area is being assessed but I don’t see how that’s possible. Either way, I’ve given up any hope of us having power back this week. We are strongly considering just leaving and heading north. We have family near the Canadian border so we might see if we can stay with them for a while."
"77063 and the power has been out since 6:30am on Monday. My complex didn’t think to mention to us paying for garages that if the power went out they have no way of manually opening them, so my car is being held hostage, easily the most frustrating part.

Any suggestions for a break in?"
Wanted to update those in my zip—just saw our power (77070) came back on about 25 mins ago!
[deleted]
"77042 near Woodchase park, no power for almost 60 hours"
"Still no power at 77573 League City for me. Certain business and apartments do. But I have pretty much accepted that this might get fixed by the end of the week. Lower my expectations, to not get disappointed"
77084. Regained power about 8pm Monday but lost It again Tuesday night. CenterPoint account says we have our power restored but the meter still shows no power. Probably going to have to find a vet to board the dogs tomorrow so they don’t have to go through another day with AC.
"77005.  No power for 3 days.  1 year old in the house.

This is not acceptable for one of the richest states in the United States.  This is not acceptable of any developed nation.  Nothing has improved or changed since the 2022 Freeze.  The current situation is a direct result of deregulation and lack of any government oversight.  Abbot and his cronies are lining their pockets with ""political dontations"" while our families suffer.  Stick it to the libs

  
I encourage everyone to contact the Governor's office. [https://gov.texas.gov/apps/contact-us/opinion](https://gov.texas.gov/apps/contact-us/opinion)

He's still in South Korea by the way.

  
Vote.  There is so much effort put in by the right at the state level to suppress urban voices in Texas.  You have to vote in such numbers to overhwelm that suppression.  30 years of republican strangehold on our state government has led to this."
"Update for 77027 Riveroaks District area, still no power. Water is also out in some areas as well."
FYI: Father just purchased a generator at Northern Tool. If anyone is looking for one.
77036 my power just came on! Off since 5am Monday. Let’s go hopefully it doesn’t turn off and hopefully a lot of people’s power will restore today. Sending hope and wishes!
77008 near 18th and Yale power back on.
Anyone from 77077 just get the “several more days” email? People across the street have power and I’m actually gonna go crazy if I have to wait a few more days

"77478/77479

77478: Looks like power is coming back on in the area. Might be some areas that won't have power. Whole Foods shopping center has power as well as First Colony Commons. Town Center, I think I may have seen some lights there but I wasn't paying attention when I left the house this morning.

77479: Sweetwater looks to be ok now, I think the problems are along University. Probably should head north or south if you need to get out of the heat. Hopefully y'all get your power back soon.

Anyone can let me know if Costco (on University)\* will open today? Would like to head over there after work if possible. Thanks in advance!"
"XXXXX - still no power, had to leave for my dog. Did not see any linemen when I was out on the road."
Does anyone know why a neighborhood would not have any colors on the center point map? My parents moved to 77386 and their subdivision hasn’t had power since Monday morning but it’s not assigned any color on the map.
"77007, power restored around 8 pm yesterday."
"77339 (Kingwood), no power since Monday about 7:30 am.  Little to no cell phone service, no Internet (Suddenlink is bad in the best of times), cable TV service went out before the storm even got here."
"Are people able to get generators yet?

I have a 4k dual fuel inverter generator that I am looking to offload. I would lend it out but I don’t trust people to treat it kindly."
77045 Still no power. Please send help
Does anyone near 77386 know if any nearby libraries are open? I really need a place with Wi-Fi where I can set up and get some work done...

"77047, City Park area. Businesses are open, but not much power to the neighborhoods on the east side of 288. Starbucks is open, but as you can imagine, it is filled to capacity. People are just plugging-in where they can find a plug outlet."
77375 just got power back
"77386 - still no power but we just got our Internet back (AT&T)! Long long lines for fuel but the gas station on 99/Burnham Woods is getting two tanker trucks a day. Cash only, so be prepared.

ETA: we filled gas cans for the generator, not our cars."
"77316, reporting from the north, near Lake Conroe. Got power back at 12:42PM. Hoping everyone gets it back soon, this has been miserable."
"77054 Ardmore, Holly Hall power is on"
77503 power on at about 1:30. Got a message from centerpoint point delay was due to damaged equipment. Said if power was still off to contact. My neighbors are out so not sure if they know there's power.
77498 on 90 and 99 has power. Not sure when I just got home. Sometime in the last 3 hours.

Has the outage map been updated since yesterday?
"Driving around Missouri City/Sugar Land trying to find a pump that has 93 gas, its crazy how some areas have power and some dont. Its like block after block its swaps.

Any one have a lead on a pump in Missouri City that has 93 octane gas?"
 here in 77095 and i think we just lost power after having it for a few days (starting  monday). i'm not sure why it's out
"77008 near Yale and 24th. Power back as of an hour ago. 

Centerpoint account says power is still off at my address - so don’t trust those readings right now."
[deleted]
So are we ready to raise taxes and invest in infrastructure yet?
"Without trying to undersell those who were impacted severely, as an aggregate, this storm’s damage seems benign in relation to the amount of power outages. Anyone else feel the same?"
77373.  Nothing. My rep is on Facebook toeing the company line. They’ll never vote her out. I think this might be the push I need to leave. It’s only going to get worse. I love Houston but damn I hate Texas.
77586 El Lago/Seabrook - no power.  The stress or heat or lack of sleep is starting to make me feel sick.  Trying not to break down; I’m so tired.

77459 still no power
"Think I just got power back at 77062. At work, but was able to establish a connection to some of the electronics in the residence."
"Oh do not worry, Shitterpoint will be held accountable as soon as Assbott is done with his more important international business deals in Asian….wait what?! 
Texas politicians straight up enriching themselves and their private club members while their state is in shambles."
"It was certainly a great idea to privatize the operation and functions of a critical utility like power. I am totally happy to sit in the dark with soaring temperatures and non-potable water if it means the c-suites at CenterPoint can buy another house! 

Like yeah, it’s 85 degrees inside my house and all my food is rotten and I’m running low on drinking water, but at least CenterPoint’s execs are making a lot of money!!!

77379 power back. Hallelujah
Reminder to reread the post for new information.

77063 got power around 4pm! Hang in there to everyone waiting. <3
"77088 (Acres Homes):

It seems like victory and Wheatley has power but the rest of the neighborhood does not. If you need gas I'd suggest going to the swift's right there because it was empty when I went at 4:30AM right now and fully operational."
77030 - no power or water since very early Monday (5/6a.m.)
What does it mean if my area is green on [this map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195bcf03ae0c491f9f14bf77f2c43420) but my entire street is dark?
"77025 no power for some, mainly on Aberdeen and Dumbarton. Majority seem to have power. Shell station on Stella Link and Braeswood has gas, hard to get elsewhere. 

All lights on Bellaire Blvd West of Stella Link were completely out for about 2 miles. Be very careful as lots of drivers are missing this or not treating them as a stop."

"If there’s a tree leaning on a power line right in front of my building I should probably not expect to have power back anytime soon, huh? It hasn’t been removed it. I might lose my mind. "
"77021. We briefly got power for a couple hours around 7:45pm, then it cut off again. The neighbors across the street still have power, and are fully lit up, but my side, plus the houses behind me have been dark since 9pm yesterday. It sucked to get that little taste of power, and then lose it. Meanwhile, my neighbors across the street are doing just fine."
77008 / 21st and Yale. Power still out as of this morning. We’re yellow on the map so at least that tracks properly
"77019, no power"
"For people in Entergy territory, they released another nice long detailed update last night: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/lcg88m0/

There will probably be another update in a few hours, midday today."
"77338 - Still without power, but some businesses around me have it, ugh...."
77057 - Chimney Rock/Westheimer - No Power
77479 - got power back yesterday morning but internet was up and down all day/night and mobile data was worthless while it was out. The few gas stations I've seen open are 100 cars deep and charging $5/gallon for regular.
I’m assuming homes with fallen lines are last priority?
77086 - it’s seems like 249 has gotten most of their power back on Monday night and yesterday but nothing for my neighborhood on bammel yet ☹️

Does anybody know where to get some ice in the area?"

Just got power"
"77573 League City, still no power in some sections"
77040 - drove around from Hollister & Tidwell area to Antoine down to Hempstead and not a single Centerpoint truck in sight. Doesn’t look to be any sort of damage to lines or poles either.
"77479/Greatwood:

An update from Facebook, there are three or four power poles that are down across the neighborhood and hard to reach locations. Centerpoint is at Campbell Elementary, looking at it, assessing everything. They will have to replace the poles and then replace the powerlines after that so it may be a few days for many of the sections before power comes back. This will for sure affect the back areas of the neighborhood, I’m not sure about the middle or the front though. ￼"
"77459

Both ours and my parents house are without power. Located in Dry Creek and Sienna. Seen trucks all day driving around the area, but nothing as of yet.

HEB at the top of Sienna is open with the majority of the stores attached getting power."

"77011 most of my neighbors in houses have power but our apartment building does not, very discouraging! Lockwood and Navigation"
77389 no power
"77006 checking in. Still no power at 10:59am. I called the Metropolitan Multiservice Center on W. Gray and they’re open with power. They’re open until 8:00. The Cherryhurst Community Center I guess has power, but no A/C. Windows and doors are open and people inside. I’m gonna head over to W. Gray to find A/C. "
77023: I’m worried that my house in the neighborhood that is “energized” is going to be overlooked since we’re the only ones without power on the block.
"77477 - Stafford, The Grid, Power is back!!"
Still zero hotels with availability. Amazing you have to flee the city
Anything happening in 77007? Thanks ♡♡

Edit: FEMA is now taking registrations for federal aid."
"77008 - Lavender on the Crayon Map. No power since Monday morning.

Edit: N Main and W Cavalcade"
"Comcast/Xfinity might be starting to restore service in some areas now. The [Xfinity outage map](https://www.xfinity.com/support/statusmap) claims the people I've been checking on are still in an outage, but their internet access and TV just started working. Hopefully it lasts."

77568 still no power. Tnmp keeps updating when power will be back on but then reevaluate to a couple hours later
"77040, Hollister and W Tidwell, still no power. Having to use the whataburger app and doordash to check who has power in the area. Also still out of gas for my car, which sucks so much more than i could’ve imagined. A battery powered fan is currently keeping my sanity, though on a very thin rope. Sleep deprivation is kicking my ass today too, this is going to be a rough one.

Update 2:20 pm: I have the best husband and he took me to a whataburger that’s open nearby in Jersey Village. There’s working gas stations out here and everything, i just wish i could find a gas can to take some home with me. Still no power when I left the complex."
77055. Spring Branch near Westview and Blalock. All my neighbors have power - only our block is out and has been since a little after noon on Monday.
"77092 on the north side of 43rd st, haven’t even seen a truck and been without power since 4:45 AM Monday morning.  Don’t know how long I can hold out at home with the pets.  This heat is unbearable and I’ve got to be at work after getting very little sleep again."
77388 - had CenterPoint workers by our house yesterday evening. They told my neighbors that we’d likely be waiting until Friday for power. They can’t get trucks where they need them and are having to use four-wheeler ATVs to get their crew in.
77084. No power. Avoid the intersection @ Clay & Hwy 6
[deleted]
"77546: power is serviced by TNMP not CenterPoint, but they don’t seem to be fixing things much quicker. Their Facebook says resources arrived from Mississippi and Alabama yesterday evening. We’ve been without power since 5:30am Monday. We’re fortunate to have a small generator that can run our refrigerator and a box fan but morale is low for sure"
Any info on available hotel rooms? Small pet friendly too..
77035 anyone? Rarely seeing this zip on here.
Anyone know of a tool/way to work out where there is gas for sale ?

"There are a number of restaurants open in the Rice Village area, not all of them, but enough to have some choices. Shake Shack, Local Foods, Starbucks in the Village, the Croissant place on Rice Blvd. 

I was supposed to have our plumber out today to replace a faucet and look at a possible leak in the garage. That's obviously not happening. I have no power for him to see what he's doing in my kitchen."
77327 we started to have power yesterday at 3am

"77041, still no power but our neighbors do. It’s frustrating overall to see"
"77386, north of 99 and east of 45. Still no power. Really hoping for the best but things are starting to get a little grim. At work (hospital) I have power and AC and have to be there and then I come back to a house that’s more warm than the outdoors. It sucks. I’ve noticed neighborhoods and some businesses along 45 that have regained power on Rayford/Sawdust and that’s pretty much my only remaining bright spot."
"77070 Jones Cypresswood, my power is back on, I’m out of town so idk where else there is power"
"I honestly don’t know how to read the boiling water map. So if I’m in precinct 3, but none of those red markers are near me, am I good to use my water? Whats going on?"

"I keep reading that if your area is green on the map, but you don’t have power still, then it means you’re being put towards the bottom of the priority list. I can’t take any more of this third world shit."
How does FEMA work? Possible to get compensation for food lost in fridge?

"This is your reminder to purchase the capacitor for your AC to have a spare should it die. If you're even a little technical and can watch some youtube videos it's not very difficult to do and will save you a fortune. This doesn't fix all AC issues, but you don't want to be dying in August because a $50 part died and it's a $500 emergency AC trip charge to swap it out."
77406 (Pecan Grove) - I am on the back side on the neighbor and still don’t have power. Seen plenty of CP trucks but none in my area. The map shows green for me but my aunt it shows orange and she has power. The map doesn’t make sense to me
"77054, med center, still no power

Edit: for clarity, my complex has power, but a few buildings don’t, presumably because something blew, so management says we’re just waiting for centerpoint. Can’t even report it through their automated system because it refuses to recognize my phone or meter number (from their bill) as valid."
"77401 - no power, but i did see a centerpoint truck very close to my home! i am so excited & hopeful we will get power back soon!"
"77076, Yale St. No power since first out on Monday at 3am. 
Thinking of installing the Whataburger app to track power, much better than the MS paint map done by centerpoint"

77008 power ON  W 14th @ Dian St
Anymore news in eado/ second ward? I need some hopium I'll take any rn.

"Just got the following email:  

CenterPoint Energy and mutual assistance crews continue focusing on restoring power to the 2.26 million customers impacted by Hurricane Beryl. During the damage assessment phase we walked more than 8,500 miles of circuits uncovering downed trees and debris, impacting poles and wires across our system. We understand how important it is for customers to be able to plan around their outages, so more specific estimated restoration times will be available tomorrow. Thank you for your patience."
Buried lines or this city needs to be relocated
I wonder how many people are gonna just cut down trees in the coming months. It'll suck to see but I don't blame anyone who wants to cut down trees next to their house.

"77024: near Blalock Rd, is the power back?"
"Not from Houston, but was wondering if there’s been any discussion of the underlying issues with all the trees coming down beyond the storm itself. 

Things like poor drainage, root depth/width, tree types, poor planting techniques, etc. 

I’ve seen discussions about undergrounding power lines,  but what about a thorough assessment of the city’s trees to identify what went wrong and what steps need to happen before the next storm and the next 50-100 years of storms."

Honestly I think we might see texas go fully blue for this election. 77007. Edit this got double posted oops xd
"Americans are too docile, too passive. Everyone in this thread should already know the first and last names of Centerpoint senior leadership, president, etc. The fact that you don't says that youre just not angry enough. 

And that's okay. But that's why things are the way they are, and why they will remain so. You just don't care as much as you think you do. All of you will completely move on the second your power gets turned back on."
77023 is still out as well 🙁

"77477, Sugar Grove blvd in Stafford. Power came back on around 3pm today, Xfinity just started working half an hour ago."
77064 ? Any power
77022 North Loop E. And Fulton along the MetroRail Melbourne/North Lindale power is back up
Is anyone at cinco ranch area with power?
77090 any word?
77002 We have power. Never lost it. Main Street. Downtown Proper.
"77396–My neighborhood (only a few a streets I’ve been told) have power, including myself. CP was out all day yesterday fixing 3 damaged utility poles, one of which was snapped in half by the wind. Didn’t think I was gonna have power anytime soon, but they came around 10am and finished around 7pm when power was restored."
"77036 my part still does not have power. Centerpoint sent the linemen to fix the bigger electric outlet on the street, but never came back and fixed the damn outlets in my apartment complex."
Is it more or does it feel like Beryl did more damage than Harvey
"77024 still nothing since Monday morning. Been signed up for emails and texts since before the derecho, but I think Centerpoint has ghosted me. I'm not any color on the map to reference. My street and the two north of me are gray like we don't exist.  Blue to the left of me green to the right, stuck in the middle with shit. Or however the song goes. The rain last night was welcome and it's cool outside at the moment so there is that."

Anyone in Montrose with xfinity working?
Anyone have Xfinity back in 77008/Heights proper? 
"77471 near the brazos river, brother called that we just got power about 15 mins ago. Stay strong out there friends and Godspeed!"

[deleted]
77023 (Penwood and South Wayside)I spoke too soon.. we got power and lost it an hour later..
"77053. Still no power.

Saw CP driving around my neighborhood. Better than nothing I guess, atleast I can say I actually saw them."
Anything on 77024 Foxhall yet?
"77036 gated community by the golf area, no power"
Just got word that power is back on in 77037
"77002 no power. We had power throughout the actual hurricane, but then the power shut off 9am on Tuesday. Apparently, there were lineman across the street when it happened. This doesn't make sense."
"77015, North Shore area,some streets  have power but mine is without. Fuck CenterPoint"
77384- over 48 hours no power 1488 area.  Going to the Astros game tonight to kill time and bask in the A/C.
77584 we got out power back Monday night. But now it has gone out again! WTH? I am grateful for the day and a half of power we had though!

77093 still dark
"77024 lost AT&T fiber internet last night... neighbors across the street have it, but the AT&T outage map is approx the entire zip code plus more north of I-10."
77019. Got power on after 32 hours without. Is the food in my freezer okay do we think? Had so much food in there and I don’t wanna lose it all…
"Seems like most of the woodlands has power restored. I don’t live here, I’m in Spring, but if you’re nearby and need food/supplies many places in The Woodlands may be open today."
77035?
77450 nottingham country power is back on
"Got family in Rosenberg, anyone have power yet?"
Anyone from 77449 area? I don’t know what happen but for some reason the power went out around this afternoon even though it was back yesterday?
"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195bcf03ae0c491f9f14bf77f2c43420

"77450 no power since Monday 6 am. My mom in 77478, my brother in 77479 and my dad in 77451 all have power back 🙃."

"Very convenient of them to mark “unknown restoration date” areas as a dark green that makes it look like there’s work being done, turn that shit red and then let’s see the map."
They continuously lied about when my area would get power after the derecho and lo and behold they lied about us getting power last night 
"Shout out to my fellow Houstonians in the teal.  If we get power back after 7/19, it is time for me to move 😩😩😩. 77396"
"At what point does the irrational fear of “what if they can never restore the power in my home” become rational?

77096, no estimated date, no power in the house."
"77388, Spring. Cypresswood near 45. Still no power. For the last couple of days they were saying we’d be on by the end of day yesterday. So that was a lie. I’m feeling genuinely sick at this point and I’m so tired of waking up with these headaches."
Anyone else have to stop themselves from treating functioning stoplights as a 4 way stop? Houston’s breaking me
Well ain’t that a bitch!! Turquoise Gang wya? 😒
"77077 briar forest and kirkwood, still dark and have been since Monday at 5a. I can’t sleep for various reasons but I’m also so fixated on when we’ll get power back. I can’t tell you how many 77077s have gotten power and per usual were last in the area. This has started to lower the home value in our neighborhood and will make moving even harder."
"If I’m going to be without power for over a week you would expect to see a fucking war zone of downed poles and lines, but fucking nothing. Just drove the full circuit from where there’s power to my house and it’s all clear. Too fucking disorganized to send a truck and fix a fuse. Fuck Centerpoint. We need to sue this shit show into the fucking ground."
77037 still no power. My birthday was yesterday. It sucked ass.
"Addendum:

For the sake of your mental AND physical health, not only go out, but talk to someone."

"Reminder:

1.  Check the main post often for new information. 


2. Don't be in a hurry to completely restock your refrigerator once you get power. 


3. Think about your placement of your generator."
"77018- garden oaks- still dark on day 6!

Husband and I want to buy a generator this weekend, but I feel like they’re gonna be hard to find. Anyone have any tips or where to look? We want the one from Costco (sorry I don’t remember the brand) but I feel like it’s gonna be hard to find. 

I applied for fema assistance today which made me want to cry.

Update: got a generator at 610/Ella Lowe’s. Window AC unit is saving my life rn."
"77007 near St Thomas checking in. I was encouraged to see some patches of electricity in the neighborhood last night, but I might go crazy if we don’t at least get a restoration estimate soon."
"If you see price gauging (hotels, gas, for example), please report it. https://cao.harriscountytx.gov/Id-Like-To/Price-Gouging"
"77080. 

7 days without power during the derecho and on 6 now with Beyrl. 

My birthday was during the derecho event and my son's second birthday is today. We cancelled the party since we don't have power and still haven't sighted a single centerpoint truck or lineman crew in our area. 

They have power across the street from us and have since Monday night. It's insane that folks living 100 yards from us have had a mostly normal week while we've been left in despair with almost zero information about when we might even expect power back. 

Something needs to be done in Spring Branch and the NW side."
We can all bet our bottom dollar that our power bills will arrive on time this month. Get ready to pay up more and more for less as we all know the cost of this fiasco will be passed on to consumers. I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.
"77021 no power since all this 
My mom died on 7/11 and I can’t even go home and be comfortable at home. What the fuck is this shit."
"I said I would feel better having a date. Upon seeing 7/17, I was wrong. This feels so shitty."
"77373, Spring by treaschwig Kroger.. still no power 😞"
I'm squatting at work. How long before I can own this joint? I feel like the lady that lived in the sign.
"Can we pin this thread? 

Also, this may be a stupid question, but can they fix the lines while it’s raining?"
I’m so fucking over this shit and the fact that I have to do it another 4 days is actually unreal. Centerpoint can lick my sweaty gooch.
I45/N Main.   Still no power.  FUCK CENTERPOINT 
Probably worth clarifying when possible that the “without power” is really a meter count. There are roughly 2.85 residents per household in Houston. That means 2 million people without power.
"77007, we DON'T have a crew assigned to our neighborhood yet 😭😭😭"
"77024. Hunters Creek Village. I've been out since 6AM Monday. According to the map, today is the day. Derecho outage was six days. Freeze was six days. Let's see if we can't go three for three. 

Here's to hoping Abbott Mac & Me's his ass off K2."
"77025 Woodside. Crews worked for two days in the neighborhood, resorted most everyone: except 10 houses at the end of one block, including mine!

Quite the gut punch to get the ""power restored"" email followed by another ""we're aware of a power outage effecting approximately 10 houses, of including <address>""

My wife's first comment ""this means we're back at the bottom of the priority queue, right?"""
"77379 - bunch of linemen staged in the parking lot of the Klein ISD therapeutic and readiness center, also been seeing them running around kuykendahl rd. Hopefully they see the two downed poles next to the cvs Walgreens 🙏"
"After 3 days I finally saw a ""crew"" from centerpoint in the area again. It was literally just 2 guys staring at a lightpost and they didnt even have a ladder. 💀"
"I checked the centerpoint tracker before I fell asleep and it was at around 681,000 without power. 

Just woke up and checked and now it's over 690,000 without power.


Not a good sign that they'll have us by the weekend"
77092 - I'm pretty sure I'm never getting power at this point. All hope is lost.
77007. Birdsall st. No fucking date. Fucking bullshit
"In the Heights near 14th & Studewood, 77009.  Nothing.  Day 6. I’m so angry & defeated."
[deleted]
Centerpoint map has shown my neighborhood as energized for the last two days.  Not a house has power in it.  Rumors going around the 16th is our hope.  This is immensely frustrating.
"Fire Centerpoint. Fire Greg Abbott. 

Abbott has been having a great time on vacation wining and dining at fancy restaurants around asia with the VP of centerpoint while everyone in Houston has been dying."
"77007 Jackson Hill and Feagan, no power or running water in some houses and an entire condo building. The map shows a collage of colors and no dates on when things will be repaired. Seriously disheartening. ♡♡ stay cool everyone

Edit: I've had people check the area since the updated map saying some have power, the condo building and a few houses on the corner of Jackson Hill and Feagan are without power still."
77008 - west 16th near Yale - just got power back
"Map said Tuesday, just came up about 30 minutes ago. 77009, near Montie Beach Park."
Are there any organized protests anywhere?? I've got nothing else to do 😭
"Not that this is a great insight or anything, but a week without power is about 1/50th, or 2% of a year. 

Pretty crazy to think that this year many in Houston have had two of these events. This is the 28th week of the year, so if you have been without power for two of those that equates to about 7% of the time. 

That is an insane metric for a developed country, and officially disqualifies a city from calling itself the energy capital of the world. 

Energy outage capital of the world may be more appropriate.

Good luck to all the rest of the hurricane season."
"Missouri City, we got power and lost it an hour ago"
"I just filled my gas tank. If any organizations providing shelter need someone to pick up donated supplies, please dm me. I am happy to help."
77009 -Norhill. THE POWER IS ON!!!
Updated map has my area projected for July 15. A whole week without power. Absolute bullshit.
"77084 anyone else in an ""energized"" zone with no power? Theres no date and honestly just feels like we've been forgotten"
"I'm in one of the few areas left without an estimated restoration date. I counted my clean clothes to make sure I have enough to wear to work next week, and I'm trying to make that last by hand washing and air drying what I wear at home. It's so humid it's a bitch getting anything to dry. "
What are we to assume if after todays update we STILL do not have a restoration date and are pending review? Seriously going insane over here and any answers would make me feel better
"77096, near Foodarama plaza - we finally have power, came back around 3:15P.

First map had us in the blue (assessment complete). Second map showed an unknown date. Today’s showed 7/17 for date of restoration.

My fear is this power will leave again, I feel like I’m still living on some kind of edge. I’ll never see thunderstorms and rain the same away, and I’ll NEVER forget what Centerpoint did. 

My hope is everyone gets their power restored asap, and far earlier than next week."
"77007 Washington near 1-10…came back 10 mins ago after spotting Centerpointless trucks in the area.  FYI, i spoke to CP earlier today and they had a list of the work being done in the area.  The agent said she couldn’t give me a date, but that it was a good sign.  5 mins after hanging up, i got the CP text saying by the 17th I’ll have it back.  The lack of internal alignment is actually impressive…"
"State representative for district 139 is seeking volunteers for cutting trees for seniors.  To sign up or for additional information, call 713-534-4628


Added to main post."
"77043 near Kempwood and Gessner


We don't even have a date on the new map. Thankfully I have somewhere to crash with power, but my elderly neighbors say they want to stay put in their home and I worry about them. They have my number and I told them I'm only 20 mins away I'm happy to bring them food/water/anything I can but they said they're fine. They have a car and still drive so I can only hope the best for them. "
"77092 near 43rd and TC Jester, still no power and no signs of when it might be back. People real close to us have power but fuck us I guess. Just wish I could have an expected date so I knew how long to brace for. As always, fuck Centerpoint."
"77388 spring, off of spring cypress. Had power for 3 hours last night then it went out again. Been out for 8 hours. Power alert messages say crews are working on it but im fucking skeptical"
"77098 - Harold and Hazard. No power since Monday morning. Apparently CenterPoint knows about the outage, but the newest map shows us ""energized"" which is discouraging. We are with a block of about 28 homes, and the Phoenix on Westheimer which are all out of power. When they reopen and if you live near, plan a visit, I'm, sure they are hurting after a full week closed especially missing the soccer crowds."
"I wonder what will happen first? I get power, or we run out of Beryl puns? 🤔

Also, any tips to cutting up a destroyed fence to move to the curb? I'm guessing a sawzall will do it?"
"East 77008 near Studewood & 20th /Cavalcade power restored ~9:00 AM

Thank you, field personnel!"
"77043 - Still no power. Our neighborhood is the lowest of the low priority every major storm. Took over a week for power restoration after the derecho. Clearly going to surpass a week for Beryl. 

I’m so jaded on this city. Born and raised here and never would have thought about moving somewhere else until recently. Now I can’t wait to get out of here so my future children don’t have to endure the rampant incompetence in this city."
The # of customers affected keeps going down and for the life of me I almost don’t believe it because our neighborhood / area is still a powerless desert 🌵
[deleted]
"77088 Antoine and Victory, just got power back. Took exactly 6 days, just like last time after the derecho. I hope everyone without power gets theirs soon!"
"77004 still no power, even though centerpoint's map indicates that we do."
So I’m part of the turquoise of doom and just spoke with CenterPointLess. They said they’re waiting for a tree trimming crew to come out and there’s no telling when that will happen. Apparently the issue was referred to the tree trimmers on July 10th and that’s why they can’t give an estimated restoration time. I’m so over this shit
"77092 near 290 & Bingle - no power. Seems like much of this zip code still hasn’t been prioritized or even have crews nearby. The traffic lights on 290 & Bingle are working. 

Tried calling CP and couldn’t get a representative on the phone."
Just noticed the 16th and 17th were left out of the restoration timeline yesterday. Wonder why…
"North side update: 77379 is still without power (most of louetta rd and Klein area) if you still don’t know HEB has been open all this time and they have been using a small part of the store as a cooling area / device charging area, if you need gas the Circle K @ Louetta and TC Jester is open as well as a couple smaller gas stations in the surrounding area, they’re still packed but not as much as before"
77030 - No estimated time of restoration when I called. Does that mean we are going to be the last ones to get power back?
everybody in my area from businesses to homes are starting to get power except us. been dealing with this shit since monday 6am i'm convinced we're not getting it at least until next Friday... maybe. i have completely lost all hope
"I am out of town but just got a notification from my ring camera, so I think we got power back!!! 77008 at 11th and Ella."
Anyone have any updates on 77007 the Jackson Hill Area and Feagan Street? Ty♡♡♡
"just checked the new outage map. it says my area is energized as of 12 pm when it was 7 pm when I left my house and it was still dark, with no indication that they will come back and finish the rest of the neighborhood. 

fucking assholes"
"77389 - we got power, yes we do, we got power, how 'bout you?"
"77025 West Bellfort and Stella Link. Got home from work at 10:15 p.m. carrying my usual 5 lb of ice. The lights are on My place smells like a locker in 7th grade boys gym, so I have some work to do. Tip of the hat to the moderators who kept this Reddit informative and interesting. 

My thoughts go out to those who are still waiting. It's an effed up grind but you'll see the other side."
Can this post be pinned mods?
"77042, just east of the beltway. going on day 6 with no power. we were told by centerpoint that they were trying to get power back by end of day Friday. spent another hot sweaty night here for nothing. sigh."
"77386, 99 and Rayford. Most of the neighborhoods around us have power. The   CP map is nothing but false information."
"77075 power still out/ South of Hobby. 
Neighbors across the street and to one side have had power since the 10th and everything even managed to stay up through the thunderstorms. CenterPoint map shows everything is energized, but still no power. All of our food got trashed and pickup was supposed to be yesterday, but it makes sense that's also delayed so walking outside is pretty awful in front of everyone's houses. I'm surprised I haven't seen more animals taking advantage of the food. FEMA denied the application for aid so time to try and appeal. 

Struggling to find pumps that still have fuel."
"In my neighborhood, there were like 15 line trucks in our street for 5 hours yesterday afternoon.  They did not restore power."
"77092 - 43rd and Antoine.  Still nothing and no sign of centerpoint in the area.  Map doesn’t have a date.  I can’t afford to keep eating out, just got a generator from my parents but definitely don’t have the money to keep it running for another week or more.  I’m feeling really hopeless right now."
"77389-- North side of spring-stuebner, between falvel and holzworth. No power since 6a Monday. In the 'no eta' area of the map 🫠 neighbors are being friendly but I am so over the sound of generators all night.

Edit: HOLY SHIT IT'S BACK"
77007 - Near I-10 & T C Jester. Power is on but water went out late yesterday evening. I’m unable to find any info on it
77070 near Champions Whole Foods. The back half of my neighborhood got power last night but we are still dark. As is my mood.
"77096

Still nothing"
77036. It’s hot. I hate it here.
"77009 - still no power. My fiancé one block away from me has it, at least. But out of his small section of the neighborhood that has it, half of them lost it after yesterday’s storm. One step forward, two steps back."
77064 west road and BW8. Said power was supposed to come back yesterday. Everything around me is still without power. Map says energized. Nothing has changed in my area since Monday.
77005 - showing energized on the map but no power. I’ve called the same number for centerpoint 4 times in the past two days and EVERY SINGLE TIME there has been a vastly different automated message/reporting process. What a joke of a company
"77034 - Gulf Palms - Power back up at around 14:50 local time (2pm, almost 3pm)

I am... very thankful right now. It's gonna take a good day or three to get back to normal, but right now, just to be able to type this on a proper full keyboard instead of my phone is a fucking dream come true."
77008 - T C Jester by Buffalo Bayou. Power came back on about an hour ago.
"It's still much less detail than Entergy has been providing, but Centerpoint has finally started posting limited updates for their specific services areas, here: https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/Safety/Pages/Storm-updates.aspx?sa=ho&au=res"
"77040 - Bingle and 290.  Turquoise and still no power. 

Seems like every warehouse between the highway and my neighborhood is lit up but no power lights are working and neighborhood is black."
77096 - no power in Meyerland 8S.  Hope today is the day.
"77023 (Eastwood) - still NO power. On Day 6. Also, Centerpoint’s stupid map shows we are “energized”. Wtf!"
Centerpointless. Give us an estimate when we will get power!!!’  This is ridiculous
Power came back on overnight here 77088. Just hoping it stays on now..
77042 just lost power after it had been back for days :(
We had power all week then somehow lost it at 9 this morning.  WTF.  I literally just got a CPAP.
"Not local so idk if worth adding to the list /u/justahoustonpervert but Teladoc (telehealth provider) is offering free telehealth calls to people affected by Beryl. From the email:

"77339-Kingwood-Bear Branch. No power. There are 2 poles down in the Greenbelt behind my house. The rest of the lines in the area seem to up and ok. 
There are trees down all around the poles. It is going to take them til mon or tues to get the lines up according to the local line worker I spoke with.
The cross street to mine does have their street lights back and a few houses."
My brother got power for a bit and then it went out again today! 77063
"77389- Spring- Londonderry Subdivision.
Still no power.  There was a sighting of a couple of utility trucks but I did not see them.. this is a Nightmare"
77459 been without power since monday 5am 🫠
"New centerpoint map shows my neighborhood and others in my area as completely colorless what the fuck does that mean? 
6 days without power."
77018 near Shepard and Martin we show in the pending date section on the new pre-school map but just got an automated call from centerpointless saying to have power by the end of day 7/18 🙃
Anyone that has been restored and got an alert with a date beforehand- were the power alerts accurate?
77386 in imperial oaks just came back half an hour ago and its stayed on since \o/
"77008 - 18th and Seaspray - this is SO frustrating! Apts across the street have power and even some buildings in my complex, but not mine *cries Houstonianly”"
77024 chimney rock and i10 power is back on as of 2 minutes ago
77027 near the central market. Just got word my power is back! The estimated date they said was July 17th. So that map is completely useless.
77009 Montie Beach area. Just saw 4 box trucks going past the park towards Patton. Please power gods.
"77007 by Canyon Creek and the McDonalds on Westcott, I can see my smart devices are back online. Looks like power was restored just recently."
"Not as many updates here :( hoping it’s because everyone is getting power back

Still dark 77077 briar forest and kirkwood"
77373 still no god damn power. Gonna be a whole  nother week. 💀
A lot of people are saying to invest in generators. Is there an alternative or something people in apartments?
Do I need to get on Tinder and settle for anyone with power?

77090 Near Nanes and Redoak still has no power
"77345, Back of Kingwood, no power."
77099. My neighborhood is showing as completely green and the other side of the street is lit up. My side is completely dark and people still running their generators. It's a map of lies.
"77373- Green Highland subdivision no power. This is a new neighborhood. All the lines are underground so folks that say, if lines would be underground, it would solve problems. No it wouldn’t."
77015 - ded
77071 gessner and W Belfort. No power still. Haven’t seen a truck at all. No date on the map. I keep having panic attacks because I’m just giving up that I’ll have lights but all of my family does. I literally can’t do this. My apartment is so hot I’m suffering I’m missing work. I just want to move to an apartment with lights so I can have some normalcy in my life again.
77008 no power - map says my area is fully energized.  No idea what to do at this point
"77388 near Lemm elementary. In the energized color, but everyone without power."
I guess the CNP customer service team took the weekend off. Can’t get a hold of anyone.
"77007 w. 6th st, half the apartment building still no power"
[deleted]
"77018- literally moved in on Tuesday with no power. Went from “assessment complete, crew assigned” for 3 days to “partially energized” (but no one was?) yesterday to being a part of the fun teal no restoration date now. There’s a power line down in the middle of our street and it’s coned off. Huge tree branch on another power line. Haven’t seen a single crew anywhere near us. 😭"
[deleted]
"77063, Still no power in the neighborhoods around Gessner/Briar Forest"
"77389 - Kuykendahl area.

We did not have power this morning.  

Drove to the Red Cross shelter to charge up my portable battery unit and phones to get coffee and sandwiches.  Saw three bucket trucks on Kuykendahl, and also a worker with one of those long pole doohickey thingamajigs that are used to reset the breaker on a transformer"
77069 - Just got power back
Does anyone have news for the neighborhood of 77070 right at the corner of Louetta and 249. Looking at the map it’s planned for today but everything around it has power. I left town and am wanting to know if it’s safe to return. Calling stores near there seem to be without power.
77035  - trucks have swarmed the neighborhood!
Anyone else get a restoration email update around 430pm that includes a date of 7/16? Wondering if this is a generic message or not
77066 restoration date pushed back til the 17th
"77091

They're finally cutting down the tree on Donovan and Brinkman St. There was a whole fleet of trucks back there. Plus another fleet working on the other downed pole in the similar area on Sue Marie. 

I got hopeful that maybe we'd see power in 24-ish hours. Then received email from CP saying that they are shooting for EOD Wednesday July 17th. 

I'm going to assume the email, like the maps, are completely made up. Hopefully this Garden Oaks area gets power soon."
77042 - finally got power this afternoon around 3.
77379 near Stuebner and Spring Cypress came back on half an hour ago!!
"77007, Centerpoint trucks are slowly making their way down Petty St."
Restoration date pending review 😃
"77092, 290 and 43rd St, Just got power back!!!!

Across from the Joe Vs"
"77388 spring cypress near falvel road. Had power last night for 3 hours and today for 3 minutes. No updates, no trucks in sight. How can i contact a living person and check for real life updates?"
"77024 @ Memorial & Chimney Rock - Power just cut out for us.

Edit: back on now after a minute or two. Whew."
"77003, Delano and 45. Power came on last night!"
"77080. Near Kempwood and Blalock.  Lots of power around here but not my neighborhood. Half my neighborhood including my street doesn't even have a color coding let alone restoration date. 

We had line trucks on our street at least twice on Thursday and Friday. Power came on briefly both days. We luckily have a place to be until Sunday but we have to be gone Sunday afternoon. Not sure what we will do then bc finding another place to go with four animals isn't easy."
77021 - MLK between OST & Griggs / after 102.5 hrs of no power ours got restored Friday about 11 a.m. / fridge and freezer are likely completely lost but that's a battle for a few hours from now / still have yard full of tree trash and slumping fence filled with tree... Joy.
a few buildings of the apartment complex off of meyer forest and west bellfort were missing power is that still the case? can anyone confirm? 77096
"77023 still no power. Really hope that map is more misleading for us and not the crews to come fix stuff because it says that the neighborhood is energized when it is only partially energized

Edit: just remembered something, when I spoke to a centerpoint person about my outage and a potentially downed energized power line, I asked them if they see the grid feeding into my address and they confirmed that they didn’t. This kind of tells me that the map is absolute bullshit. I just hate the fact I have to trust this clown company to restore my shit despite the map tells me it’s already restored


Edit2: they updated the automated menu: the automated service said “based on your record, we can see that there is an outage present at [my address]” it’s now no longer just a report an outage and then you’re done phone call."
"77090 power back on 1960/45 area. Except my apartment building, I will pay you $20 to throw a bucket of ice on me. $10 if you spit on me."
"77043. No power yet. After Derecho, CP took 7 days to restore power."
"77037 and no power 

*Also ordered a Wii recently and no power to play it ❤️"
77025 just lost power again. Seems to be a full blackout of the area around Stella Link/Braeswood.  Even family who never lost power during the storm are out
"Another crowdsourced outage map:

https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/6bf34d1e7ff3442e956110715c7d0c08"
77069 still nothing.
77498 seems like we’re the only neighborhood in the zip code without power and no restoration date in sight 😢
"FYI: SNAP recipients have til August 8th to request replacement benefits for lost or destroyed food due to the storm. Call 211 or [submit this form](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/regulations/forms/1000-1999/form-h1855-affidavit-nonreceipt-or-destroyed-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap-benefits). WIC beneficiaries should call their WIC office for info on replacements benefits for July.

Also keep an eye out for [D-SNAP](https://www.disasterassistance.gov/get-assistance/forms-of-assistance/5769) (disaster food stamps) announcements for those not on SNAP. Typically after disasters disaster food stamp benefits are available for the population at large up to a certain income limit, but multiple government approvals are required to ok the program so it might still be a bit."
77098 Marshall & dunlavy- I am in a nested outage with about 5 other houses on my street still without power. I called and got through to a representative and was told that my surrounding “area” had 250ish houses still out and they planned to have the whole area back on by today or tomorrow.
"77375, Memorial Springs by Old Louetta and Spring Cypress. My part of the neighborhood got power about an hour ago."
77008 date shows 7/16. I have no faith it’ll be that date
"77063, no power. Saw 8 trucks on our street two days ago. Three yesterday. None today. 
Received two different emails from CP saying we have energy flow but it 'must' be a problem on our end. 
Can only assume we're last on the list and won't have Jack until mid next week."
77373 - anyone else get an email with July 19th restoration date??
"Spring - both east and west of i45 and hardy toll road

Power is still out, several of the lights at the intersections of I45 feeder road and the associated cross streets (like Richey) are still out"
"77064 - had power since Tuesday. Lost it for 5 hrs yesterday. Got it back. Went out again this morning. Centerpoint is useless. Family in other areas of the city still don't have it. 

Yesterday was my birthday and it sucked!"
"77584, Southdown neighborhood

We're part of a lovely nesting outage. Haven't had power since Monday morning. Our neighbors got theirs back two days ago."
"My neighbors have a giant tree in their backyard, but its branches extend a little into our property and are beginning to entangle with various wires since Derecho hit, and now it's worse. It's a really tall tree so we would need to hire some pros to take care of this. Since those branches cross over into our property, would it be our financial burden to take care of it?"
"77077 South Ashford Forest still has about 2,200 people without power. Hardly seen any trucks and CP rep says that it’s still waiting a crew assignment lol"
"77036 Premier Apartments on Woodfair, no power still, sadness continues"
"77023, Lombardy St., still no power. "
"77006- same post as yesterday, still have power but no internet and 0 communication from xfinity/comcast. Anyone in a similar situation hear anything or have their internet restored after being out?"
Lol anyone sued them yet?
"I’m very sorry I bought a townhome at this point - no generators allowed. We can afford a generator, we’re the end unit so it would be possible to get it far enough away from the house…the hold up is that we are not allowed to store gasoline or propane on the property. Something about a fire hazard, blah blah blah."
77009 by W.Cottage street. Nothing. No updates either
"77035 - Willow Meadows, still no power. We’re in the teal no restoration eta section in the middle sandwiched between partially energized neon green trees on the centerpoint map."
Saw a CP trucks around 77077 Briar Forest and Enclave. This area has power so not sure what they are doing here. Briar Forest and DA south is powerless thats where they need to go.
"77006, Montrose and Richmond

Finally listed as under repair for Xfinity. Outage tracker shows some improvement in the area"
77013 no power
"77017, broadway at concord. Still nothing. No restoration date given. I'm starting to lose my fucking mind."
Anyone have any news on 77586/Seabrook?
Any updates on 77373? Heard that there was a sighting of four trucks around the area
"For people in Entergy territory, here's a copy of their latest detailed update: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/ld1dvbm/"

77388 next to Lemm elementary: just got power on
77070 near Louetta got power around 4
"77388, Cypresswood near 45. Was told today we would be up by the end of the day. The crew is working on the other side of the neighborhood, but so far have only been able to get power to the surrounding houses around the elementary school. It seems like that half of the neighborhood is significantly worse off than our side and thus repairs are taking some time. The new update from Centerpoint I got via email now has us at Tuesday the 16th. I’m really not sure what to believe given the poor communication throughout this entire ordeal."
"77072, the intersection at Bellaire & Dairy Ashford and its surrounding neighborhoods just got power back earlier today"
Let's demand the Centerpoint CEO resign and work to remove the monopoly this incompetent company has delivering critical power services! Sad to see so much suffering in the hands of such incompetence.
"77571- Still no power.

Stayed up late to check genny at 1 am to sleep in a little until 7am if I could.

Thunderstorms got me up hiding the genny from the rain and lightning at 5am. 

FUCKKKKK.

OK back to it."
"77077 briar forest and kirkwood, they just updated the map to 7/16…. That’s extremely disheartening"
"Still no power at my place. TNMP estimates 7/13 in the evening so I’m crossing my fingers

On the updated centerpoint map one of my buddys does not even have a color over their neighborhood 
Can’t be a good sign if there’s a color for “we have no idea”"
77345 Kingwood.  Backend beyond the heb  refuge.  Pending.  Guessing they know it will be a while.
"77521 - Near the hospital.  

Out since Monday like everyone else.  Have never been given a restoral date and CP stopped sending me update alerts all together on Wednesday.   "
New Caney 77357- still nothing.
[deleted]
77063 Ventura Lofts. Management said we would get power back on Wednesday. Well…..
"77373: Cypresswood/Old Cypresswood

I’ve been out of town since late Thursday night.  The Map shows me energized. I’m on the north side of Cypresswood while it shows the south side of cypresswood still pending review.  

Still haven’t been home, is this accurate?  Just wanting to see if I can come home this evening."
77076 Northline still down. The front block of my house has light but my whole role does not. Idk how this would be an I individual issue as plenty of houses don’t have lights but according to there ugly ass map we are suppose to have power.
"77074, Fondren and Beechnut, East of HCU, Sharpstown 2 neighborhood got power yesterday around 6 pm."
77006 Missouri St. small pocket of houses still without power but the map says we are energized. I’ve reported the outage online several times. Is it worth calling and trying to talk to someone? Has anyone with a “nested” outage in an energized area had any lucky with calling CP?
77042 (From Ring) CenterPoint is staging trucks at the Target on Westheimer near the Whole Foods
"77025 near Stella Link and West Bellfort. We are marked restoration date pending a review. I know what that means in plain English but I wish they had added some context about what three view process is and what type of resources are devoted to that process. 

That's the type of transparency that while not bringing power online any sooner would give some customers like me a way to process what is going on. Center Point is just really crap when it comes to dealing with their hostages/customers"
Anybody know where to return/dispose of the little green 16oz propane cylinders? Home Depot maybe?
"For people in Entergy territory, here's a copy of the Saturday evening update: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/ld29pba/"
"77586, Seabrook.

Power is on!!!!"
"77055
Wirt between hammerly and long point.

Earlier it had ""power back at the end of the day""

Now we're back to spending. Great.

Hope it's just the rain making them change this."
"Would like to get some opinions when it comes to a portable generator set up. First time using one and I’m trying to be as careful as possible. I live in one of those usual Houston townhome looking houses so the neighbor is just a few feet away. Safest bet was to put the generator into the backyard, on a level surface. It’s about 1.5 feet away from my house and the neighbors house, and the exhaust is about 3.5 feet away from the fence. The fence feels a bit warm to the touch so I’ll try to put some more room between it and the exhaust tomorrow. I know this isn’t ideal but how unsafe is this setup?"
"UH reopened their Student Center Thursday and you can get water and recharge devices there. The UH Hilton has been open throughout. They have a restaurant. You can also go to the second floor where the conference rooms are and usually find one that's open where you can recharge devices. But you can recharge devices almost anywhere on the first and second floors, and you get a comfy chair, too. The place is mostly run by students and if you're not complaining and act like you belong there, they won't give you a second glance.

UH has its own power plant, and never loses electricity or wifi. I understand Rice is similar but I'm less familiar with their layout. Still, these are important things to know, since we've barely scratched the surface of hurricane season. 

And don't overlook hospitals, folks. They have generators and they have food. Many now have had their power restored, anyway. Don't go to the ER unless you truly are in need. Head toward the patient wing. Wait a few minutes, then go back to the lobby and relax. In the extremely unlikely event someone questions your presence, just say your loved one is sleeping and you don't want to disturb them. Make up a room number. They won't check. 

Smith Tower Methodist Hospital in the Med Center has a meditation room that's always dimly lit, empty, and has huge comfy chairs. A person could probably camp there for days without anyone noticing."
"Hang in there Houston! We got power today, you will too! 77063"
"77077, power is back on. Ac is not working 😭"
Has anyone with a nested outage been restored?
"77041, no power but we are classified as a “nested outage”. Honestly feel like we’re royally fucked"
"Centerpoint has the new service area outage tracker. Im apparently in the greenspoint service area. Earlier it was at 120k people out of power, but now its over 202k people. How the fuck did 80k people lose power in half a day. The greenspoint service area is almost half of all remaining power outages in the city. What the fuck is going on"
77336 no power
"Is power back on at 77036 Forum Park? My wife got a call last night from neighbors saying it was back but this morning, we received a text saying the lights were all out again. I’m confused"
77029 Clinton park still in the dark literally and figuratively. Teal on the map. Who knows when.
"77377 

Neighborhood  didn’t lose power during derecho for but an hour in and out

Lost power for like 6 hours Monday, power ever since.

Not to rub it into faces, just curious on why more fortunate? Lucky side of hurricane? We have lots of big trees."
"77068 by Cypress wood/Cutten. Turquoise Gang...please kill me. About 1/3 of my complex has power but the others don't. Also that same 1/3 got power back at 5pm Monday, so less than 12 hours without power."
77008 Herkimer and 12. No power.
77345 neighborhood no power. We're shown to expect power by end of day yesterday lol. Anyone know a generator maintenance company? Going to be investing in a trifuel whole home generator. Already ordered the AC stepdown
77042 - Apparently two Centerpoint trucks on the south side of Walnut Bend.
77373 day 6 No Power
"77060
AIRLINE @ Busch st
No power"
"Those with power in 77055, are we seeing any Xfinity/AT&T repairs happening?

Obviously we need paper to everyone ASAP, my heart is out for those still without."
Anyone know if The Parker apartments on Memorial and Birdsall st have power back yet?
77024 fox hall is back! We’ll see if it holds
"77388, cypresswood near 45. Centerpoint appears to have restored power to a majority of the neighborhood and full power to the adjacent neighborhood, but my street and block are still out. The crew appears to have already left so I am feeling very disheartened at this point."
"Hey y’all. Just looking for some info. My wife has her own business - a spa - that operates out of one of those suites places with multiple hairdressers, nail places, etc., all owner operated. The whole mall is down right now, and has been since Monday (of course), so she’s out all her income, but still paying rent. What should be her sequence? Check her own insurance first (I guess) but if there’s no coverage for this or the deductible is to high is there a county, state or federal assistance program available?"
77339 outage/power line down in neighborhood. nobody has come
"We need a Centerpoint complaint mega thread, seperate from the power outages. The sub is flooded with complaints"
[deleted]
"Please use this thread for general discussion of the storm recovery. DO NOT POST ABOUT POWER OUTAGES HERE. That just clutters this thread when we have another place for it.

"Honestly, most of these power outages would have never happened if Centerpoint did some type of tree maintenance around powerlines

Their lack of maintenance on powerlines caused this whole issue"
that elderly woman dying alone in her apartment and only found because of a wellness check was heart breaking.
"77055 - The forecasted restoration date is 7/19, for 11.5 days without power on the street. During the derecho we were out of power for 6 days. We also lost power from a regular old storm for half a day in between. 

By 7/19, day 201 of the year, we'll have 18 days without power here, ~9% of the year so far, putting my address slightly behind the averages of Botswana and Yemen. 

Or from the other direction, Centerpoint has only provided uptime 91% of the year."
"I just wanted to say that rumors on local social media (e.g., Nextdoor, Ring) being more accurate than info provided by CP is ridiculous. Also, people having to ask linemen directly for information on their outage also speaks volumes to the lack of coherence and transparency at CP.

My heart is with everyone who still doesn't have power!!"
"77521, Baytown. Still no power, still no email or text from CenterPoint, still no sign of any workers to even assess my neighborhood. 

CP map still shows that we're energized, but we still aren't. 

I have to go back to work today, and will have to leave my pets at home in the heat. I've run the generator all night to try and get the house as cool as I can, but even if I leave it on when I leave for work, it'll only run another hour or two before it runs out of gas. 

The fact is, this is not sustainable. It's not fun or ""let's come together"" or kumbaya, it's criminal. This is cruelty. 

To not even get a fucking email from CenterPoint is beyond unacceptable. 

I'm seeing other people are being told the 19th, hopefully that's a worst case scenario, but seeing as how my neighborhood hasn't even been acknowledged, I have zero hope."
[deleted]
"77007, live downed wire affecting 5 homes, day 8, neighbors & I been calling Centerpoint every day

Pregnant wife, no power, no estimate, no hope in sight."
77011 - got the text last night telling us it would be Friday when we get power back. Xfinity text me telling me they’re going to start throttling my data and their help line doesn’t work. So everything is going great over here.
"77098 - Harold and Hazard, just got power back. Also received the email last night saying power won't be back until Friday, yet it kicked on just a few minutes ago. More confirmation that the ""Friday July 19"" messaging was just a blanket generalization. Hoping everything is restored much quicker (but not betting on it...)."
77023. No power. No internet. Can’t leave the house due to looting in my neighborhood. It will be like this until Friday according to CenterPoint. Being tied to my home for 12 days feels like Covid all over again. Depressed.
77339 - still nada. Does CNP think changing colors on the map is going to make us feel better?
77092. Still a whole lot of fucking nothing.
"77008, Centerpoint is waiting on a homeowner who refuses to take action on a tree in his yard that's leaning against the power pole.  We've all talked to him and he is convinced that the city should take it down for him."
"Idk if this will help anyone, but I got an email and call from CenterPoint telling me that due to my area being “localized, isolated outages”, my estimated restoration was supposed to be Friday by the end of the day. Not even 15 minutes after I got that message, our power finally came back on."
"77066 - Monday 7/15 - Still out, and the map says by end of day Wednesday, still.

I think a big part of the problem, right in the middle of the purple section on our map, is [this pole that's down](https://i.imgur.com/Nj67JQP.jpg) near the Tim Horton's at Richie and Bammel N. Houston.

I have to go to work today and leave the house on generator power, but sure hope someone sees them starting to do some work on this pole today. It's not a simple one because there are underground conduit runs involved, but it'll obviously have to be fixed before a lot of us get power back."
Anyone in Oak Forest 77018 still out of power?
"77007 Heights. LOST POWER AGAIN today at 5:30pm after being restored Saturday night. No explanation, no estimate, no linemen in the area. 

I just finished deep cleaning the nasty fridge and restocking with essentials after putting kids to bed last night.  I can’t keep doing this."
77077 part of the nestled outage. No hope
"77066 (12:30pm) Still dark, BUT on my way home for lunch I finally saw crews actively working on the downed lines that I highly believe will restore the power to my complex and surrounding businesses, stoplights, and subdivision. I sure hope so, had to return to work today, so couldn't keep windows open at home and it is almost 90° in my unit. I'm taking my cat with me for the rest of the work shift, but hopefully lights are on when we get home later this evening. "
"spring branch by antoine & long point, got power back. fuck CP -- burn in hell."
77098 - no power from my house on Harold to the The Phoenix on Westheimer - which is OPEN w/ limited menu running via generator...FYI
77373 spring by Kroger treaschwig... everyone around me is energized but apparently we're not getting power till eod 19th 🫤😕.. and I've managed to get a fever so I'm not doing so well...
77048- still no power. Just kind of losing my mind and hope. I love my home but I’ve made up my mind on leaving.
For those that have questions about generators r/generator that should help you in detail.  The link has been added to the megathread.
77007 just off Studewood. The only house without power and it feels hopeless.
"Power was just restored at 77018 near Rosslyn and Bethlehem. CenterPoint trucks were canvassing the neighborhood for the past half hour. If you are still powerless, I am hoping you are next."
77008. 18th and Durham was up on Tuesday but went down again yesterday with no ETA.
77069 just got power!!!!! I’m so thankful my boss is understanding and not going to make me return to work till Wednesday so I can have time to get things back in order.
77006 Montrose nested outage back on!
77339 no power. Seeya tomorrow day 9!
"77346, still nothing. Hating Houston more everyday"
77037- still no power😞
"77023: Pearson and Broadmoor has power now. Didn’t see any linemen driving around yesterday so it was pretty surprising to get the notification that my power was restored. My house was confirmed to be a “nested outage”. Before the restoration notification, I received one saying it wouldn’t be restored until the 19th."
77096 Meyer Forest Apartments. 4 out of 12 buildings have no power since the storm.
"77006, same situation with xfinity/comcast. Have power, haven't had internet in almost a week. Very grateful to have power, and very annoyed with xfinity for 0 communication. Anyone have their internet restored? Everyone I've talked to so far has it still out, but they're reporting 80% restored on their blog (havent had any direct communication about timelines either, just a generic ""you have no internet"" email.)

edit: my app now shows an ""estimation"" of internet restoration at 11:30 PM on Wednesday night. great."
77063 we were part of a nested outage and got power at around 9pm last night. If you’re in a nested outage make sure you check with Centerpoint that they have a ticket assigned at your address otherwise you may be missed
"77029, Moms house had power regained yesterday and she lost it again this morning at 8:30am and has been out since"
"77041, we called Centerpoint and they said somebody got assigned to our nested area. Hopefully today could be the day and not Friday."
nested outage in 77504 we were told they would come on thursday but 4 center point trucks are standing outside my very house!!! the nightmare is over!
"77076 Northline, still not light since I’m a nesting area :(
Edit: just called the emergency line to see if anything can be done or rushed as I have an elderly person living with me and all they told me was the systems were down… like how tf are there systems down?!"
"Just want to say my power is still out, so I contacted all my elected representatives from city council on up to US congress. As of this morning Centerpoint had a rep call me personally to say the power should be restored today and that they would be providing me updates during the restoration process. If anyone is still having trouble getting at least a restoration date from Centerpoint, may be worth trying this approach. My power is still out but I at least have hope for its restoration for the first time in a week."
"77459 Creek Terrace/Cartwright.
My block and the block behind me have no power. The entirety of the rest of my neighborhood has power. As far as I can tell, 99% of Sugarland has their power back. 


77016. My mother's area, no power."
"77093 - Tidwell and 59, no power in area 😔 new restoration date is the 18th now after being the 16th and then 14th"
[deleted]
"77055. Hammerly and Antoine. Both my parents and I live in the same neighborhood, literally one street from each other. Their neighborhood shows energized but they have no power and my home just shows as having an assessment done and ETA for power restoration is 7/19 but who the hell knows when I'll have power. I've been camping out at my parents but I hate it and wish I was back home."
Can someone suggest a coffee shop inside the loop that doesn't get super packed? I need to get some stuff done for work and our office still doesn't have power.
"77095 Nested outage

[No power because a fusable link was popped by a branch 4 days ago after we got power back for 20 hours](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/719564477070180476/1262208438386163804/image.png?ex=6695c2b6&is=66947136&hm=c668e88d72f42e52585c0463925db135c690f7242820951c9839813c35e9ce80&)

No centerpoint in the area because we're 'Energized' and they won't give me an estimated time when someone will come by to fix it.

It's a 5 minute fix that we're on day 4 waiting for."
"77082 - part of nested outage. Last update was from my apartment complex saying that CP has assigned a crew, but there is no estimate yet. I have not received email updates from CP despite signing up for their alert service"
77002 - I’m sorry for those who lost power and or haven’t had it restored yet. God bless.
055 here. Still hot and mad.
"77075 South Hobby- still part of this ongoing nested outage. My dad out in Lake Jackson texted me last night that they got power back. Day 8 of struggling to sleep and waking up still hot. Can't deal anymore

EDIT: WERE BACK ON. I saw a dangling line/line on the ground and reported the emergency yesterday afternoon. There was a whole crew here starting about 3 hours ago and now we have fans and lights again. I don't know if they came for the emergency call or if was just finally on the docket, but I want to give every one of those crew a beer and a steak, holy shit."
"77074.  Still no power here (we're ""energized"") but it's on across the street.  Street lights on our side are powered, too, but none of the residences.  No visible damage to the weatherhead on the house or lines leading to it.

eta: JOBU BE PRAISED!  Power on at 1646."
"77024 Still no power, I've heard people in the area getting power but ours is pushed til the 16th"
"77023, next to Mason Park. Tree from park is still downed over power lines. No linemen seen. They really do not give a fuck.

No power since 8am literally last Monday. No estimate from Centerpoint. Nothing."
"77092, Nina Lee and Antoine - no power"
The map updated and my area of 77066 is a pink blotch in a sea of green....
[deleted]
"77035, still no power in my area, out since 5am Monday"
77054 still out😰Part of a nested outage with no date for restoration. I live in a complex of 22 buildings and 6 are still no power!
77098 stuck in a nested outage. house got to 90 degrees so we finally evacuated the cats to somewhere else (family we're staying with has dogs and cat allergies)
"People really need to stop attacking the linemen trying to restore power. Today and yesterday people have tried to shoot, stab, run over, and block access to several crews."
"77070 my section of neighborhood got power around 7 pm yesterday—such a huge relief. Unfortunately there’s still a small section without power, and estimates are unclear right now."
77346- had it till storms on sat took it away. Now. Nothing.
77043 off of Gessner. No power still but workers were out yesterday. We are completely blank on the map.
77087 near gulfgate (45s and 610) still no power. Got an email from centerpoint saying this Friday
"77074 Next to Jane Long High. Originally, they said that they power would be back by Sunday night, but here we are still without power. As someone who immigrated here, this is some third-world shit."
"77379 - My parents have been without electricity since 6:30 AM last Monday and after getting power for a few minutes yesterday, something blew up a few blocks away and they were given an estimate of Friday, 7/19.  They are in the middle of what seems like a 3 mile by 3 mile dead zone."
Powered is finally restored 77086. Best wishes to everyone still without power
77008 - 18th and Ella - I’ve now learned that I am in a “nest outage” because buildings in the same complex as me have power which means CP’s estimate for power is Friday.
77396. Day 7 without power
"77055 - Have had power the whole time. Xfinity has been out since before the storm. Of course, just the normal bullshit from their reps online as to when it will come back. I wish we had reliable services here.

With power issues, internet, flooding, and heat it seriously makes me contemplate uprooting the family and moving somewhere else."
Im off weds and thurs. Any protest or any movement i can join?
"77339 - We're not getting power until Friday the 19th.

They said it's because of a line over the San Jacinto, but looking at the map shows all the lines over the SJ have been fixed OR do not even connect to us.

In fact, most of our grid, if it's accurate at all, are right next to grids that either have power now or are getting power today.

Make it make sense....TWO WEEKS from a tiny storm, absolutely insane."
"77021 (inner loop near macgregor/Griggs) …………..only house on the street with no power. All I NEED IS CP TO BRING MY METER! I paid for a brand new electric panel (per the cp worker that did the assessment last week. I even used his recommended guy) since my old panel was destroyed by the storm. It passed inspection by the COH this morning and has the green tag. 

I cannot get a person to relay this to nor can I leave a message. 

It’s kinda like how grocery stores have a 15 item or less lane for faster checkouts? CP needs something in place for quick jobs. 

Haha, this is too rich: The MF CENTERPOINT GAS truck just parked in front of my house on a mission to place the gas lines! That’s not the CP I want!

Anyone know any magic spells ? Voodoo? LoL to keep from crying."
77373 Cypresswood No Power
77339 no power. Says end of day Friday.
77004 only my neighnor in the downtown/midtown area has no electricity.
[deleted]
"77073 in the general vicinity of FM 1960 and Aldine Westfield. Power came on around 6PM Sunday though the map said it would be Wed the 17th. 

There are still some up and down Aldine Westfield and Cypresswood in this area of Spring without power. Not many comparatively but there are some."
77396 still no power but according to the Centerpoint map others in my ZIP code have their power restored. I think my cat's probably a more trustworthy source though so it hard to feel any hope about seeing progress on the map
77007 - lost water again. Called 311. Water line break near Lillian and Patterson reported at 9:54a. Expected completion 6-7 hrs.
"77025 - lots of outages between Stella Link and Academy. No signs of any action. Showing as grey in a sea of green on the outage map.

Edit: power back around 8pm!!!"
Spring Branch 77055 - Hammerly and Johanna just got power back
"77055, East Spring Branch, most houses just got power back on. A few streets, closer to Antoine, still no power."
77041 dying here at night
77066 - We're free. Power is on.
77098 our building and several houses on our street still without power. Been in Houston for 1 year and really want to quit my job pack my shit and go back to Dallas at this point
77022 - Independence Heights.   Have had power for a few days.
77018 and 77080 nested outages. Reported as coming back the 19th.
"77042 got power back on Saturday afternoon / East side of BW8 @ Briar Forest.

I say this for my neighbors & everyone still out of power: CenterPoint can eat a BERYL of DICKS!!!! This shit is unbelievable that there’s pockets without power."
77006 nested outage near Agora - power is back ON. I didn't see a single CP truck in the area until about 7p last night. Now they are all over the place.
"Anyone scheduled to get power today, how's that going? I was supposed to get it the 13th but that got pushed back to today. Members of my family go back to work and I'd like them to be able to sleep comfortably"
77021 map has said restored for the past 2 days but it’s incorrect
"77338 Riverwood/forest shadows area still no power
Apparently the map says we should be receiving power today yet I haven't seen one center point truck or anything here today.

Loosing hope"
"77380 power was just shut off again, no one at centerpoint was able to tell me anything when I called and they said their system was down so they couldn't look at my apt complex"
77396 - power back on!
"77018 power is back, it did flicker and I am worried about the incoming storms next week"
"here, nested area. i am starting to notice a pattern. The neighborhoods where people plant their trees right under the power-line and refuse to maintain it, thus, causing the branches to craw all over the power-lines are the main areas that are taking longer than usual. For the luv of god, if u have a tree, please maintain it or don't plant one at all."
77089 - Still no power on my side of the street while the other side is energized. Also got the message for it to be fixed by Friday but I sure hope its sooner.
77089 still no power and the map says energized. 😤
Has 77066 west richey and veterans been restored yet? I read that they were working on the pole in front of tim horton's.
"Saw it posted in the outage thread already, but 77018 just north of pinemont has power restored. We were told no earlier than the 18th fwiw"
Power back out in Missouri City 77489 last night around 5pm..after being on since Thursday.  Centerpoint said they're shutting down some folks to assist others in area...saying it was necessary to work on transformer
77043 power back on
77339 - no power. I guess they stopped updating the map once they hit 90%

"77098 Has anyone heard anything from xfinity regarding the outage besides their normal “there is an outage in your area blah blah blah” 
Can’t wait for them to blame it on severe weather so they don’t have to give an outage credit when my internet was fine Tuesday and Wednesday when I got power back but crapped out Wednesday night"
77006 power and internet (AT&T) are back up but I take the red line to work and it is still running on replacement bus service. It takes me forever to get to work.
nested outage in 77504 allegedly we're getting power back on thursday.... ight we'll see 😒
"77302. 1314 & 242, got power back around 9AM yesterday.  Unfortunately, it seems only part of our area has it. Hopefully it comes on for everyone else today."
77021 - Trucks spotted on Bowling Green & Charleston.
Is centerpoint’s 713 207 2222 number not working for anyone else?
77024 Power just went out around 3:30 PM. Hasn’t come back on yet.
Did anyone in 77018 just lose power again? Had it restored Saturday now it’s gone :-/
77386 - still no power and have not received an update from centerpoint since last week. Must be a transformer issue.
77021 - 2 days of power and now it’s off. Someone needs to be held accountable for this nonsense.

"Hey everyone! Our pecan tree has been cut down. The service we used didn’t pick up the large pieces that lay in our yard. My question is, where do we dispose of these pieces of trunk? Can they be picked up by the city tree removal trucks?

More importantly, the base of the tree is still rooted in the ground partially. I would rather hire someone more professional to handle this part of removal.

I stay in the northside of Houston near the 77026 area. Thank you.

The service we used wasn’t really a business but people with time and wanting to work. They did a good job."

Power went /back/ out 77505.

"Oh and Jesus lord. 

If you’re running a generator, don’t have it inside 😓

Deer Park FD had to respond to multiple instances of carbon monoxide last night, because people were running generators in non ventilated areas."
"That nap just made me sad. Based on the color it shows we have power but as I’m typing this in the dark hot ass room with no power, it feels like we’re gonna be at the end of the list and having to wait days. Fuck center point"

77042 rooms are kinda hot me and the family cannot get any sleep at all might need to clear out the fridge in a few hours if power doesn’t come back.
"77494 and no power, shit service, but i’m glad they restored power to the light fixture store that is closed and has 9000 lamps in the windows. gonna take an edible & sleep on a cold towel i guess"
77008 - just got power.
my cell service (t mobile) is worse than it’s been at any point
"Museum District 77004 near Fannin/Binz still without power. I haven’t seen any CenterPoint workers after driving around here, Midtown/Montrose, Rice Village, or River Oaks. Where are the supposed 12k workers at?"
I feel like the updates are getting slower and slower as it creeps into the evening…
"The crazy part about this is our area was out for 5 days in May and you could **SEE** the damage. Like down poles, etc. This time we're down still and there is nothing visible in the area. It's actually insane."
77057 This no power thing is actually starting to mentally affect me. Drove to HEB on San Felipe and not a dang utility truck in my area not one.
"My map status is orange, I have truly no idea what “assessment in progress” means but it seems like that’s the worst category out of the three. 

Just took some melatonin, if I don’t wake up to power tomorrow my dog and I are getting out of here tomorrow morning."
The map isn’t accurate so I don’t know what kind of false hope they are trying to pull. It’s showing my area as green and my apartment block plus surrounding are still pitch black
Anyone know how the process is to get FEMA help with food. $200 in groceries gone after this crap
The Centerpoint outage tracker is increasingly confusing to me. It couldn't actually be that more outages are starting... could it?
77009 white oak st by the park. Just got power back at 11:50 am July 9
"For anyone in Entergy territory, they posted a nice long detailed update earlier today. I posted a copy of it in the 'power outage updates' thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/lce2fgt/"
"77007 my brother just spotted line workers, so it shouldn’t be much longer."
Does anyone else show as energized on the outage map but doesn’t have power
The number on the outage tracker actually went up. Lmao is this a joke.
Another section of 77008 just came on (W TC J & 18th)
"FYI - got an email from Murder by the Book with the following:

>For those in the Houston area, if you’re without power, we’ll have a cool space, free refreshments and plenty of power strips for device charging from 12-4 today. Please don’t hesitate to stop by! We’re happy to help with charging in forthcoming days as well. Our event with Meg Gardiner tonight is still happening, and we hope to have a good crowd for her, as her books are some of our staff favorites!"
"CenterPoint just sent this email out:

Restoration efforts underway following Hurricane Beryl
We are working around-the-clock to restore power to the 2.26 million customers affected by Hurricane Beryl. The first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, Beryl significantly impacted CenterPoint’s service territory, with damaging winds reaching 97-miles-per-hour in Brazoria County, 89-miles-per-hour in Harris County, and 78-miles-per-hour in Galveston County, according to the Houston-Galveston National Weather Service.  

CenterPoint took steps to secure substantial mutual assistance support before the storm made landfall. These crews were positioned in nearby locations for safety and accessibility. As the storm intensified and the scale and scope of the damage increased, we secured additional mutual assistance personnel. When it was safe to do so yesterday, CenterPoint released crews into the field. All told, we have mobilized nearly 12,000 frontline workers to focus on our restoration efforts.  

[restoration timeline link below]

There are many factors that contribute to our process. Please know that we are working diligently to address the issues affecting our system as safely and as quickly as possible. We will send updates as they become available informing you of the restoration stage you are in.  

For more information visit our Storm Center and follow us on X (formerly Twitter) for real-time updates. Be sure to enroll in our Power Alert Service® for outage details, estimated restoration times and community-wide updates.  


https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/Documents/Restoration-Timeline.pdf



Edit: I’d just like to add that since my home apparently fits in restoration stage 4 I think I will need to leave the house and head to my in-laws up north. It makes sense that the issue is a busted fuse if the rest of my neighbors are fully powered but I’m not."
The Woodlands. The ONLY place with restored power is Billionaire Road on North Shore. Nice
What the fuck is this lightning all about?
Hello thunder 😳
Did anyone else get an ominous message about “several days” from Centerpoint
"Just reading thru the latest Centerpoint excuses made me stop at this quote:

""“While we tracked the projected path, intensity and timing for Hurricane Beryl closely for many days, this storm proved the unpredictability of hurricanes as it delivered a powerful blow across our service territory and impacted a lot of lives,” said Lynnae Wilson, Senior Vice President, CenterPoint Energy. “We know we have important work ahead for our customers who depend on us, especially during the hot summer months.”

They tracked the hurricane for days and were STILL taken off guard... By a cat 1 storm.

Oh yeah, Tomball is still without power in my area. Though the businesses across the way seem to be doing just fine..."
Manifesting power coming back at midnight pleeeeease whatever entity can help my newborn needs some AC 🙏🏼🙏🏼

"77007. no power no water
Edit: rip got a text from centerpoint saying days"
77008 at 24th and Bevis - power just came back on
"77007- power out since 7:30 yesterday. Flickered on for a few minutes this morning and nothing since. 

I spoke to someone at centerpoint on the phone and she confirmed that it’s a “device” out in my area. I also told her I hadn’t gotten a single power alert this whole time and once I hung up I at least got some texts from them. One said they’d fixed the problem at my address (they hadn’t) and then another 20 minutes later saying they were aware of the problem lol.

ETA: Also no water since yesterday morning."
"Galveston, no power, 95 degrees in my place. I'm suffering, told it's going to be anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks 🥰🥰"
77006 by black hole. Still without power. My job down the street off dunlavy (77006) near common bond has power (no generator) and from what I know will be open tomorrow.
"77004, midtown by 288/McGovern
No power since 830 am yesterday. Haven’t seen a single work truck last night or this morning"
77008 Yale / 25th no power since 0930 yesterday. Just the sweet song of all the neighbors generators running constantly
77008 the Heights 21st and Yale. No power.
"77006, Montrose, near Anvil, we just got our power back on a little under an hour ago"
"New information about boiling water on OP.


PLEASE READ."
The tracker hasn’t updated for an hour. It’s 87 in the apartment and I am so scared for my cat. I just want some ac man that’s it
"Found this map to some what track where you might be in the queue for restoration https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195bcf03ae0c491f9f14bf77f2c43420

Seems like my section in 77584 near PJHS has been assigned for repair"
[deleted]
"At this point I think it’s safe to say that most of my area (Westbury/Meyerland) is still without power. We got out of the house a few times today and did not see a single business or gas station open other than HEB, and no Centerpoint trucks. 
If that’s the case all over town I’d say they’re nowhere close to their stated goal of 50% restoration by tomorrow. 🫤"
This thunder giving me PTSD right now
77096 near Chimney Rock and South Braeswood. Power still out. Lots of tree debris has been hauled to sides of road but had to dodge a dozen branches when I drove a 1 mile loop last night to check things out. Traffic signals are 100% dead.
"Anyone make the drive to Austin? How are the roads?

My parents are considering driving over to me in Austin since my mom is sick and not able to withstand the heat. They are in 77459 - no power since 2am yesterday."
77008 near heights high school - got an alert our power was restored from centerpoint but went to check house and circuit breakers. No luck. no one in the area has power. Ugh
77007 near Washington and Durham got power back
"Walked around SE end of 77009 yesterday and today, and its super disheartening to have not seen a single centerpoint truck in my neighborhood"
"Bullshit, most of everyone in my neighborhood got their power back but we didn't"
Added cooling center information
"77004, still no power. Going on 30 hours with no power. No signs of life/help have been spotted either"
77429 it is 93 degrees inside the house right now and is and the cats are showing early signs of heat stroke. This is ridiculous.
77007 Washington/Sawyer no power still.
"In laws just got power back in 77459, Sienna."
It says my area is green on that map but its still pitch darkness for me.
"Does center point have people working through the night, or do they eventually stop for the night and start in the morning?"
77008 and 77009 still out. A few houses look to have it back but not everyone else
"77057 house still without power but kid's daycare which is nearby reported they have power back. Hopefully that means crews are in the area, I haven't seen a single truck since the storm hit"
"77024, Hedwig Village, power is back"
"77006 still no power, going on 36 hours now. By black hole"
77006 in Midtown has power back (near the Camden's)
"In case anyone is wondering, CenterPoint is responsible for streetlight repair, and they have a portal to search by light number and report issues.

The one in front of my house was damaged in the Derecho, then damaged even worse during this storm, and I drove myself crazy trying to find streetlights on 311's site."
77006 Harold St near Graustark - just got power back!
"Just got an obvious scammer call about “any problems with my AT&T service.” If you have elderly family members that may fall for these scumbags trying to take advantage of vulnerable people at an even more vulnerable time, give them a call and warn them about scammers calling them. It may seem obvious to you, but it isn’t always to them."
Power came back in 77007 (west of yale/ south of 11th) about 30 minutes ago
77077 still no power. Cordless/battery operated fans might be a good investment in the future!!!
77042 - Finally got power back! We're at Beltway 8 and Briar Forest.
Pampered Pet Inn off Kirby and Bissonett had space to board more animals earlier when I was there. The house got up to 87 degrees and we had to pull the trigger and drop our pets off somewhere cool. Their phone lines are down so they will not respond to calls. Only emails.
"Not even Centerpoint’s tracker is updating since 7:45P and my account isn’t loading… wonderful. 

I keep seeing 77096 get restored but nothing for us here. Kids are getting very uncomfortable and we have 3 doggos sprawled on the floor 😣"
The outage map is up with color coded areas. Hope that means we get more answers
"77479, Sugar Land still out... and got a message from centerpoint stating expect late Wednesday to early Thursday for restored power......... sigh"
i’m curious if there’s a logistical reason that they won’t indicate which geographic areas they’re focusing on first. it would be nice to be able to make an informed decision  
This storm outta nowhere what the.
77092 still without power. Been that way since 9am yesterday.
Still nothing in 77009. A few places by Cavalcade and N. main do. But nothing yet in surrounding areas.
"77024 @ Memorial & Chimney Rock. Still no power since early AM yesterday. Haven’t heard an update from Centerpoint but there are teams clearing the branches and debris from the roads, so progress."
Still haven’t seen any CNP trucks anywhere in kingwood
"77009 Apartment complex across the street from me has power but the entire neighborhood behind it is out. 

Slowly going to need a 10 hour YouTube of generators in order to sleep."
77056 by the JW Marriot has power again!
"77004, midtown, 288/mcgowen. Still no power. This heat is gonna cook us. 

I have friend who lives by southmore and almeda with power out there as well"
77007 still no power
77004 - off of emancipation got power after it being gone since around 9am yesterday
Power just tuned on 77056 on Post oak
"77008 aurora / Yale crews on scene , several utility trucks. Positive sign"
77004 Museum District—power just came back on at 10:30 PM.
Accepted I may not get power till like Friday probably at this point. Anyone have ANY tips to cool down when trying to sleep. I’m all sticky and sweating profusely. My feet are on fire!
"Can't confirm, but apparently in the emails sent out by Centerpoint. They expect to have ""80% of households up and running by Sunday"". 

I could understand this with Ike, maybe even with that derecho storm which was pretty strong in a small area. 

But a Cat 1?"
"77006: No power still at 5:08am.  

Anyone know if the Metropolitan Multi-service Center was open/had power yesterday? 

Next time I hope to have a car. I should have hopped on a bus and left town Friday or Saturday night. I plan on getting a power cell, a cooler with wheels, and cold packs ASAP for my next hurricane survival kit. "
Just got power at 77007. Near Schuler and Knox.
"77056, Hyatt Houston Galleria. Every building across the street has power, but our hotel has even lost all emergency power. All hallways and stairways are shrouded in complete darkness, even during the day. No water nor AC. I was homeless in Phoenix at one point and am doing okay, but some of these people aren't. No hot meals since yesterday's hotel breakfast before the hurricane cut the power at 9am. We have loose powerlines all over the sidewalks and some across the road."
77019 (River Oaks) is still without power since yesterday morning. Not surprising - we have a lot of old trees in the neighborhood that came down. But I can attest that the rumors that we've been receiving preferential treatment are untrue. The folks who still have power are because they have generators.
77006 (midtown) still no power since 6am yesterday. Kinda frustrating seeing some of the other apartment complexes and shopping centers (On the Kirb area) have power since yesterday but my complex doesn’t. Praying this power comes on soon its getting miserable.
77007 Rice Military near Memorial and Waugh. No power since 7 am yesterday.
"77433/bridgeland

My pocket section of the neighborhood has power (got at 2p yesterday) but a lot do not. We sustained minor roof damage (some lifted shingles) so I’m having to get someone out for that.

My in laws generator failed yesterday at 6a even though it was just serviced. They can’t get a hold of the people who serviced it (for $1500…ouch!) so they’re headed over here with cats in tow to stay as long as they need to. My dad is in the hospital up in Pennsylvania today, to add to the stress level, but hopefully he will be okay. Waiting for them to get him sorted out and will check on him in a bit. I can’t really travel due to being 33 weeks pregnant (a lot of airlines will cut you off at 34-36 weeks) unless it’s like severe in which case I’ll have to figure it out.

I’m fortunate we are okay, but trying to keep my stress levels low for the sake of the baby and my pets. The pets will be happy to see the in-laws for a while."
"Guys, any CVS pharmacy open near Sugarland ? I need to get three day loaner meds. Doctors office closed."
"77019 near the Whole Foods

Power is on, and the Whole Foods is open"
"77058 no power but PSA if you have an apartment garage like me and the only way to get in is through the roll door, there may be what looks like a peep hole that is actually a string to the latch you can pull down and that will let you raise the door. Stay cool everyone"
"77498, got power back about 30 mins ago"
77584: just came back on line
Downloaded the Whataburger app and yeah still no power in my neck of the woods. I’m going home to sit in a sauna. …fun
"Got an email from CenterPoint saying power issue resolved and my meter is showing as power on on centerpoints website, but we still have no power. Should I report a continued outage? Or will my power likely turn back on soon."
77006 Midtown Bagby/Helena St apartments power restored thank the lord 🙏🏽 wishing everyone the same soon
77401 entire neighborhood restored besides my one street doesn’t seem like a good sign 🤡
"77407 - Still no power. Cell service kicked back in about an hour ago, so hopefully that’s a good sign.  

FYI - I got my AC running off the generator finally after installing a Turbo Air Easy Start. It’s the opposite of the newly popular soft starts.  It basically dumps a huge charge to kick start your unit so quickly it shouldn’t trip the breaker(Also known as a Hard Start).  I work for an HVAC distributor and we had at least 10 in stock at my location still.  If you need one, lmk and I’ll send you info where to pick it up. Very easy to connect.

"77042, Wilcrest and Westpark and Walnut and Richmond area, no electricity in the nearby apartments, however, public lights, traffic lights and even lights for bus stops are working so I hope we get power soon. I have read earlier that someone in our Zip-code got electricity a couple hours ago"
77379 just got power like 2 mins ago!!!!
77007 was just driving around to charge my phone and power came back on about 5 mins ago literally as I was walking through the door.
77089. Left for San Antonio yesterday and trying to convince my girlfriend we should just stay there forever and never come back. I think the power is on because I can see my thermostat is online.

"77077 still out in half the neighborhood. Kept seeing transformers arc and spark last night but nothing [good] came of it. The other half of our neighborhood never loses power. Truly. Not during any storm we have had in the 7 years I’ve lived here including Harvey. Meanwhile, our side of the street is one stiff breeze away from darkness at all times."

"77598, still not a lick of licktricity, and I haven’t seen any of the centerpoint bucket boys around here. The taco truck across the street is open and fucking delicious, and I’m trying to decide if it’s a smart idea to eat spicy food in an apartment without AC"
How am I supposed to know if I’m in MUD 421 and need to boil water? Why is it impossible to google the boundaries of a MUD and get a quick map?
"Reporting live from 77096 S. Braeswood @ Frankway Dr. (Behind Lowe’s in Meyerland) 

Power came back for 3 glorious seconds. It’s gone again.

I noticed workers on street are working on lines. Their trucks didn’t have CP’s logos though. Idk my guess is out of town support. Interesante.

UPDATE: Spotted a few CNP F150s too. 

- BalconyHawk"
I’m guessing there’s going to be a legal food fight that we start hearing about in a few days. The city and center point have to cooperate for now but I’m guessing there’s tension

The tree is on property owned by the owners of the Allen House and Sovereign apartments.  If any residents are on this thread, I would be curious to know if their property manager is trying to expedite restoration by hiring a tree removal professional."
77018 by Washington High just got power!
"77021 
No power as of 2:30pm, but Centerpoint updated at 1:49pm that power was restored - I’m assuming they fixed a larger issue upstream and will need to address various smaller issues around the area to get everyone back up and running."
"77546 Friendswood, no power since 7:30am yesterday"
Power back at 77505 Pasadena

[deleted]
What does “circuits assigned for repair” mean on the new outage map? There aren’t a ton of places that have that (it’s blue colored) so I have no idea what that means.
"All I can say is if you have a gas line or a propane tank, if you are able to afford the 5 to $8,000 for the Generac generator costs and installation, I would strongly suggest getting one.  Sad thing is that there is going to be a huge demand in the next few months.  My parents and brother got one where they live in The Woodlands.  The main power has gone off nearly a dozen times, but each time the generator turns on after 20 seconds and does its job.  If you can afford it and if your house can handle the setup, again I strongly suggests purchasing one especially since the Houston area has those inclement weather like you saw yesterday."
77064  West Rd area just came back
77007 cottage grove. Just got power back

"Just in from the press conference: Mayor Whitmere to sell autographed vapes to pay for the city’s impending lawsuit against centrepoint. Linemen crews expirenced in working with 3rd world electrical infrastructure are being brought in from tijiuana. Centerpoint started calling crews basically as the storm was over the city. That’s why there was nothing on their feed for 4 hours. They were two days behind calling other crews. Normally they need a full 2 days to get a full staging ready. This time, the staging didn’t start until the eye was over the city and it was raining buckets."
77051 got it at about 15:15ish. That was  about 5 mins after Centerpoint sent us a text telling us it was going to be several days
"What happens if it rains, does centerpoint wait at ojos locos?"

Power came back at 3am last night. Praying that rest of y’all get yours quick as well."
"77005, power came back, but since they didn't remove the tree.from the lines, it caused a small fire. Transformer blew again, and fire went out eventually on its own, so now I assume it'll be weeks before.someone comes to fix it."
[deleted]
"If you're looking for a portable generator for next time inverter generators are the best for electronics, fridges, etc but tend to cost more and have less output. For regular generators you will want line conditioners or a UPS that conditions power for anything that is plugged in that has a chip inside (almost anything other than say a water pump). 

Generator extension cords, the longer the cord, the thicker wire needed, the more they cost. Do not get a 50 foot cord that isn't the right gauge. The extension cord should be expensive, don't get cheap.

Get a lockout panel or generator bypass installed on your house asap. It will pay for itself when you factor in your food and sanity."
77024. Just got power back!

Got power right before bed last night (thank God)
But my 5 year old has had an extremely bad mucus cough for the last two days that the normal OTC meds aren't working on. So we will be making a journey to find an open urgent care this morning. 

As far as I know my hospital is still without power in the Woodlands so all outpatient is suspended, so at least I don't have work."
"77338--still no power since 4a yesterday. 

I definitely recommend investing in heavy duty battery banks and battery-operated fans if you haven't. We've been collecting and improving since the ice storm a few years ago and can now more less continue as comfortably as one can. Especially if you plan on staying in Houston, or TX in general."

My Xfinity internet in Humble was working yesterday I was able to WFH from 4-7 pm.

Woke up this morning and the Internet is out. I messaged by buddy in Copperfield he confirmed same thing, he had internet yesterday and it's out this morning.

I don’t have much to clean up in my yard other than one small downed tree.. but while I’m getting what I can with a hand clipper… it’s gonna take my hand chainsaw for the rest.  Unfortunately my saw is electric.. 

Not a big deal if I miss them, I can still burn what they can’t get… but I’d rather just have it all at street side for pickup when they come by."

The gas station at old Spanish trail and Almeda was packed with a line on both entrances. 

Drove down almeda back to midtown, it seemed by Alabama there was power in some areas.

"So. This rain is just glorious. We currently have a generator running outside and covered it with two huge tv boxes. The exhaust end is fully open to vent but is still protected from water getting in it. I’m totally freaking out. This is our lifeline to our fridge and our portable AC unit. If it goes out I don’t know what we are going to do. I’m literally on the verge of a major anxiety attack. Advice would be helpful.

Last time the power went out, I called CP to get an estimate on restoration, and they literally had it back on in 5 minutes after I called.

"77041, no power but we are just a small section without it, all are surrounding neighbors have it. Our fear is they are going to ignore us for awhile."
All of my posts get removed by mod…not sure why but can anyone point me in the right place to buy a generator? How does every store say they have them online and then sold out when you get there? 
"So, it shows we’re set for repairs in the map, but also that the circuits are “energized” when it used to not say that, but we still don’t have power. Anyone know how to make sense of this thing?"
"77302. 1314/Porter road. They sent out a survey crew for our downed lines yesterday early in the day. Not seen a single utility crew here or anywhere near here.

Power company said they dispatched 1300 work crews. Where are they? Hardly anybody has seen a utility truck

They also said they are working day and night which is a lie so blatant, I'm surprised it didn't bust their teeth coming out they mouth. If they were working day and night then a linemen crew would have been out here yesterday within an hour of the survey crew and we'd all have power out here already.

They are just straight up lieing and purposely not helping us to really draw out as much of the governments money as they can.

One of the most annoying things though?

One house has power out here and that neighbor is the reason all the rest of us behind them don't have power. They left a bunch of Dead trees in their yard. Nearly six large ones, all next to the powerlines. As you may have guessed, one of their dead trees feel on our lines and yet THEY still have power and I mean actual power. No generator noise at all and even the front fence lights of theirs are on.

Worst part is that our part of the grid is ready for power, they just haven't decided to stop being lazy and actually hook our lines back up. Y'all know if it was their neighborhood they would be working off the clock to restore power themselves, for themselves

UPDATE : Just had a second survey crew out here. Except this one ACTUALLY looked around this time and came to get information from people. First one was all grey, took a quick look around and drove off without a single word. This second one was all white and actually had an Entergy logo on it.

Second survey truck means 0 communication between workers or crews and company as all our neighbors have stated EXACTLY what the issue is and where, in great detail and still a second survey truck was sent instead of a linemen crew. I really can't say I'm surprised as every single job I've worked is the same way with a horrendous lack of communication. 

Same story, different day, all across America. If you're not from America and you're thinking of moving here... Don't. Pick a European country 

(Not the UK because they are just as bad off as us)

or a country nobody has ever heard of. You'll be much happier"

Hope everything gets repaired fast. The little kid in me likes to watch disaster aftermath from a far but I know it sucks living in it. Just one more day after this and 50% chance the power will be back. When I saw Whitmires vape I knew that the damage was bad. They’ll be people waiting till through at least Friday and beyond.
"Comcast/Xfinity - why does the Wi-Fi coverage keep cycling off and on? Been doing this for hours, just wondering if anyone has any info. 

I recognize I'm fortunate to only be asking about my Internet and not power right now, hoping a quick turnaround for those of you still in the yellow and blue zones!"

"77429 . I've been out of power since the storm began. The whole area around our street is dark, too. Aside from a couple of fast food places with hour long lines. Cypress was one of the last to get power after the derecho. I'm afraid it's going to be the same this time."
77008 - Heights and 18th power JUST came back on. Spread the word
Any update on 77038
"In 77004. If power came back on then transformer fuse blows, are we super screwed now? Happened 12:15AM last night.

Since areas are with power, and transformers themselves don't have very sophisticated detection equipment letting them know that our area specifically lost power.

This sucks."
77056 - any luck with getting Xfinity internet back?
77027 Costco area in upper Kirby. Just lost Xfinity WiFi. Guess they’re doing general repairs and had to reset everyone’s internet or some. When the derecho hit I got $5 Xfinity credit maybe I can get $5 more
"77037. No power and not a worker in sight, though that really isn’t a surprise for us."
Xfinity up and running

Power restored this morning on Beltway/Fuqua part of Missouri City 77489.  But no darn AT&T!  Frustrating!
77089 no power as of 8AM
"I don't think this is a Category 1 Hurricane, we have a big trees who survive decades of Hurricane and now it got knockoff like it was nothing, my guestimate wind that hit our area is 120mph max. Why the media don't report the real power of this hurricane to people? worried about mass panic?"
[deleted]
Finally a post not complaining about THEIR area not being tended to immediately. Good info
"Just drove home. Whataburger has another mile long 3 hour line for burgers from the dumbest people on the planet. 

These people cant survive without fast food.  It has been 24 hours and they are crazy."
People really be dramatic with this Whataburger.
"Heights (77008) - no power since the storm hit. A lot of big trees came down on roads, houses, and cars. As of last night, several streets fully impassable and that’s just in the couple blocks we walked around

Update as of 2:30pm: still without power

5/18 7pm: still no power, but lots of electric trucks spotted today! Near 9th&yale and along MKT trail

Hopefully final update 5/19 7:50pm: I’m at work, but I’m told we just got power!"
Reporting in for my boss over in 77079. has emailed me 6 times since 6:14 am. They definitely got power over there.

77429 off of Jones and Grant. Cypress North Houston towards 290 seemed to have power as of 8pm last night same goes for the corner store at Grant and Jones and the McDonald’s near there. They seemed to have power so if they’re open that’s some food for anyone nearby. Currently still do not have power but at 3:20am we had a short surge of power before it went off again. Nothing since.
Salute to the Linemen working hard to get the power back on after the storm! We appreciate you guys!
"77433, Cypress. My neighborhood doesn't have power. But a few exits down on 90, there is power. 

We've been out of power now 12 hours. Do we trash everything in the fridge?"
77055- Spring Branch/ Afton Village Neighborhood. No power since 6:45 last night. Tree down on Antoine and all around. Most neighbors have moved trees so neighborhood roads are passable.

77008 heights still no power
"Centerpoint's [Outage Tracking web site](https://gis.centerpointenergy.com/outagetracker/index.html) IS working (at least it is for me) but takes almost a full minute before the numbers finally populate.

At 9:49 AM Friday, [727,691 customers without power.](https://i.imgur.com/138hHlD.jpg)  

I expect CenterPoint will get crews in from all across the state - it's going to take a LOT of people and equipment to get the power back on for everyone.

It's pretty impressive that the wind was strong enough to take out several of the big power-line towers.  Even hurricanes have never caused that much [damage to those structures.](https://i.imgur.com/51Ce8R4.jpg)"
77084 still no power since yesterday. Right now I don't really care but starting tomorrow we are getting summer heat days so that is concerning. Praying for power to be restored sometime tomorrow
[deleted]
"Grapevine, but reliable info.  The high tension lines that are down on the NW side will be a VERY long project, not measured in mere days.  That's the bad news.  The good news is Centerpoint put a plan in action that will have crews coming in from all over to literally build a set of temporary electric substations to reconnect big swaths of the service area comparatively very quickly.  At last report, Centerpoint has already restored service to about 300,000 points."
"Brit here travelling around Texas. Houston is our last stop. Was staying in a sky-rise Airbnb in the Rice Neighbourhood. That shit was crazy. Sirens were going off on my phone (we don’t get that in the UK!), power went out and then the downtown buildings disappeared in the black sky.

In our shared experience, can I be anointed as an honorary Houston-citizen?

Hope those still without power get back on soon. Stay safe everyone!"
"Who has cell service? I've never experienced zero cell reception/data for almost 24 hours in Houston before. I switched to AT&T 2 months ago and my wife is furious, convinced that Verizon would still be working. The only reason I can read/post this is because I connected the home internet to our generator.

Edit: as if 8PM, AT&T 5g has been working much better for me for the last 1.5 hours (77092)"
77011 no power since 6:30 but I think I hear power trucks nearby. There's a shell like down the block so I might walk down there to see if they have power or at least some ice when the sun comes up.
77007.  No water or power.  Anyone else still not have water?

"77447, no power yet, going insane. Taking care of my fully dependent bedridden nonverbal mother with no power is rough"
"77065. No power and news says we are probably screwed for at least half a week. I drove to willis and the Loves truck stop there is open and clean for a $20 shower for those who need it. IMO its worth it. I spent 20 mins in there and felt way better after since i had to do some major repairs on my animal enclosures after the storm (everyone is okay) The Loves also have 32ct water for about $10. The Loves down 290 is CLOSED due to a sign being felled on power lines. I was lucky enough to stock up on wet cat food (friskies) and 9lives dry cat food before the storm, so if someone needs a couple of cans lmk but give me a couple hours to respond as i dont have well enough power supply to be constantly online. 

Most if not all of conroe has power. I was over near Mezcal and the HEB thats near there is open. As with the walmart and many other amenities and restaurants. Gas up in conroe is roughly 2.92-3.16"
"I'm in 77012.

No power,  internet comes and goes.  Jack in the box on Harrisburg has power... it's going to be slammed."
"River Oaks and Greenway Plaza has power/ gas/ food etc.  The Whole Foods on Kirby is open (not that I shop there but saw it).  The gas station on Washington is open (on Shepherd).  Shepherd Walgreens near Allen Parkway looked to have power as well.

  
Timbergrove is shit.  TC Jester to 11th is a nightmare, trees all down all over 77008 but not the Heights-Heights area.  Entire trees blocking the roads, but I did see two tree trimming trucks this morning there.  Also saw a Centerpoint crew on E TC Jester this morning 7 AM. 

  
Hope this helps someone looking for gas/water/food."
77035. None of my neighbors lost power at any point. Had no idea the extent of the damage until I saw on socials that we were spared from the worst of the storm. Feeling very lucky and grateful. Hope yall are doing okay

"77043 - springbranch West, still no power"
"77433 - Creekland @ 99/290 power back on.

Saw the tornado forming in the field behind our development before running in the house. I was a small multi-vortex that got wrapped in rain within 20 seconds of it touching down. I got stuck in the garage because of the pressure from the wind pushing against the house door. Just glad to have power back after seeing the damage it did to the transmission lines in our easements."
Spring Branch (77055) power restored @8pm :)
"Power back at 77070 got home at 8pm, been gone since the storm. Thank the lord. Praying for the rest of y’all to get yours too 🙏"

Good news is neighbor let us run extension to our freezer from his generator so we won't lose all those Costco goodies."
"77006, Montrose, right along the Westheimer curve. Still no power since 18:30 yesterday, but so much stuff around us is on!"
"Mods: can we have a seeking help/advice thread sorted by new? 

I need to find a hotel room for a friend with a baby and no power and everywhere I’ve called either a) has no vacancy, b) doesn’t pick up (maybe no power)

Does anyone know of a reasonably priced hotel with power that’s safe for a single mom with a baby? It’s too hot for a baby to sleep in this."
"77084 near Hwy 6 and I-10 - power went out yesterday but came back quickly. Wind blew down some trees and a few power lines. Haven’t left the house since coming home yesterday, as a downed tree in my apartment parking lot prevented my going to work. Currently pouring rain AGAIN."
77003 has power. Except the grid with my house on it. There’s an entire tree in 3 transformers. They have it taped off but no progress yet.
77023/ Second Ward area just got power back not to long ago around 5:40am. We hadn’t had power since yesterday at 6:40pm. We always had water.
"77004- power is on, plenty of trees in the streets, on cars, quiet outside this morning. A lot of damage between Durham and 16th heading down to med center."
"Spring Branch, 77055. Trees literally knocked down power lines last night. Not expecting power until Monday, if I'm being honest.

Still out. Looks like Ike. I have small kids and we said fuckit and went out of town. Gonna be hot tomorrow. No thanks.

I'm tired. Too many catastrophic weather events, and hurricanes are starting next month. It's getting hot. It gets so fucking hot."
[deleted]
77084 - no power since yesterday at 6:30pm and super spotty cell service

[deleted]
77005 - West U.  Never lost power.  All good.  Hope everyone gets restored soon.
">!77546, Friendswood/Webster area.!< What sucks is that the vast majority of people in my general area aren't affected, so schools and jobs are still going like nothing's happened and haven't addressed it, when our neighborhood has been completely in the dark since 7:20 PM yesterday. Waking up with the power still out was demoralizing to say the least, big RIP to all the ice cream I bought yesterday 🥲"

"77003 - Harrisburg and Milby 
No power since approx 7pm

"77013. Seems like the whole zip code has no power, massive branches knocked out the power lines by Woodforest and Federal. Funny things is that CP came in earlier to do an assessment, they just scratched their heads and left."
"77571 La Porte no power, my neighbor found a pole with a power line hanging and reported it to CenterPoint (there was a crew nearby), and they said it would be at least tomorrow."
"77007 Washington Corridor, power out since Thursday 6.45pm. Still out."

"Katy (77450) - power's been out since the start of the storm since about 6pm last night. Supposedly it came on for about a minute at 3am then went right back off. So fridge is definitely gone :(


Friend of mine said his apartment is flooding near downstream from the Barker, so if you have property there call your neighbors and check in. 


Also if any of yall have a renters or homeowners policy, check your policy papers carefully. Supposedly according to another redditor some policys will have an exemption for spoiled food from power loss and will not make you count that toward deductable."
77024 in Bunkerhill. Tree down on power line on Knipp but it’s been removed. Lots of trees down. No power.

"77006- east of Richmond and montrose. Houses and businesses all around us have power. Just our two blocks without. Anyone else with a situation like that? Seems like it is specific situation causing our power to be out.

77429 Cypress. Power still out and ours literally never goes out ever.
"77007, north of Washington, but south of I10. Tree limbs down but powerlines appear undamaged. No power since storm hit (unless it came back briefly overnight and I slept through it.) Power failed in a series of flickers and brownouts- seemed like the grid was attempting to compensate. Internet connectivity via cell network is spotty- sometimes it works, and sometimes not. We still have water, but I'm filling some jugs just in case."
77007 has no power as of 10:16am. Assuming nearby businesses also have no power.
"montrose 77006 — no power since storm last night, but water is fine. i’m going to sugarland where my mom lives until the powers back, which i suspect won’t be anytime soon"
77449- I guess we’re lucky cause our power came back on at about 5am and has been on ever since. My brother drove around the neighborhood and said a lot of people around here still don’t have power and are just chillin outside so no idea how the grid works around here.
77040 no power since 6:30pm. We’re averaging 2 outages a month so I fear we’ll be the last to get power back.
77375 - Tomball. Still out. Really hoping it comes back on soon. Weird thing is it came back on about 3am for two minutes then back off.
"77016 - stay by homestead in-between hopper and east mount houston area, power came back on at 3:30 pm

77429 - Power is back!
"77077, power seems to be back on most everywhere I saw when I was out a minute ago. Kroger is open, headed to HEB next to replace the contents of the fridge. Some tree limbs (or half trees) down here and there, but nothing blocking the main roads that I saw, no real flooding. We were without power for about 8 hours but I guess it was an easy fix."
77070… our lights came on for about an hour but just powered back off again 😭
Sharpstown in 77074 near Bellaire! We were somehow spared and have power.

Correction, target has power."
"Anyone else have power but no internet? Oddly enough, had internet during the storm and just after but went offline early this morning around 5am.

Very happy the lights are on at least, but I’m annoyed with the lack of communication from Xfinity. I’ve heard exactly nothing from them all day. Usually I’d receive a text message or something with an update or estimated time of service restoration. I assume their facilities are having power issues, but it would be nice to know a detailing of the situation so I can plan accordingly."

Wondering if it’s worth venturing out on the roads to get to the office, but fearful of all the morons out on the roads. I tried to venture out for food last night and turned around because people were driving like absolute maniacs and blowing through every intersection since the lights were all out- even with all the road debris."

Never lost power, no serious damage to any nearby properties.

Had to forward our phones to a cell phone, and used our cell phones as WiFi hotspots to connect our PCs to internet for email, etc.

This year is election year, and it does not matter if you are Red or Blue, we all need to embrace each other and make a change. This is not acceptable. VOTE FOR ME and I will make my priority. I am not into politics, BUT will get into it if needed. #HoustonStong"

77019 Montrose out since about 10am
77027(Greenway Costco area) power back on
Space center weather’s most recent update mentions that we have 2.3 without power compared to 2.1 from Ike. Which doesn’t make sense considering wind speeds. https://spacecityweather.com/a-beryl-moves-away-our-focus-turns-to-recovery-and-coping-with-warm-days-and-power-outages/
77080 - power out since 4AM. Feel like it won’t be back for days 🥲
"After battling centerpoint's website all day I finally linked my electric meter so they could provide me with notifications, and enabled said notifications. 


I am in 77019 and I just received an automated call from centerpoint saying that my outage is impacting 2635 customers and they apologize for the inconvenience. 


The message did not include an ETA just instructions on how I could sign up for even more notifications. "
"77447, we have power, and no sign of it going away. There is no flickering or anything, either. I hope everyone gets their power back soon."
77477 power back on!
77006 Montrose - no power back yet. Lost power at 6AM
"Pro tip that I've been using to keep friends and family updated:  check https://ambientweather.net/ 
(if you have cell internet or can contact someone who does) as a proxy for a power outage map.  

In this case, it's more of a ""power on"" map, showing you rough areas of homes that currently have power.  You have to zoom in and move around a bit to load all of the data points, but those are your neighbors with weather stations that are currently transmitting.  Draw little blobs around the areas that have no stations, and you can infer that there's no power there. 

Sure, some may be powered due to generators or batteries, but it's a good enough guess to know if you might be _close_ to an area that has been restored.  

You can also look at the charts for a given station and see when it lost and regained power.  So, if it was off between 9am and 5:50pm, you can probably guess that it's a true mains restoration. 

Hope that helps.  

- Your friend who escaped town yesterday"

"Saw center point trucks around 77478, this is where the center point plant is located at. I live around the corner from it and still no power. EDIT just saw a centerpoint truck getting tacos at 12751 S Dairy Ashford Rd. Btw it’s open tacos are 2.50 each. Light is back up and running 77478"
77008. Heights and 13th. Power stayed up through most of it but went out around 9:40 am. The issues don’t appear to be as widespread as the derecho here with many parts of the heights having power. The flickering before it finally gave up suggests a transformer issue instead of something more binary like a downed line that would take longer. Hopefully they just turn the transformer back on and we’re back.  Just in case I booked a room at the Marriott on columbia and i10 as a backup plan for tonight.
77007 out since 7:50am

"Still no power in 77087, it’s been off since 6am. The data/internet on my phone (AT&T unfortunately) hasn’t been working since 9:30am. There’s like 1 bar for most of the day. I could ping Google and Cloudflare DNS servers, but the latency was in the 500-1100ms range, name resolution would timeout. 

Works perfectly with 5 bars a mile down the interstate and when we drove around the Heights.

No power is one thing, no data is a whole different circle of hell"

"I haven't been able to get through to CP at all today. I've got a wire down in my backyard, and a tree on the service line- need to get it shut off just in case."
"UDATE5 2230 on 7/12:

- The 345kV autoxfmr in the immediate area along with a corresponding crosstown 138kV line (through the Heights to Liberty/Wayside/Crosby) are still on outage. A tentative return of 7/13 1700 remains unchanged for the xfmr, the line segment estimates have not been updated, still showing 7/10 2200. Speculation: the damage on these two particular segments appears to be heavy because the other segments returned on 7/10 as expected. There is likely some major snag like heavy equipment, fallen high-kV towers, or loss of critical equipment at the stations. Power can get to the Heights without this line but my guess is that it is the impact right now.

- Belfort and Kirby, nearby major load breaker is on outage, started today at 0900 and runs until 7/15 1700.

- Work is slated from Pearland through Friendswood, League City, towards the coast by Dickinson. This complex of lines will be out tomorrow from 0700 to 1700. Impacts will likely be minimal, they are trying to avoid disrupting more customers.

- Work in Galveston is largely complete on high kV lines.

I ask you kindly, *please* **do not blame or attack the linemen/line workers**.  They are trying their best, lack of prep and vegetation management, system hardening, etc are not *their fault*.  Please treat them with respect, they are working very hard to get things back.

---------------------

UPDATE4:  0915 on 7/11:

- Not a ton of changes overnight, mainly times updated for work going on today.  Work end around noontime in areas:  Greenspoint, Lake Houston/BW8, central Pasadena, 59/Fannin (ends 1700), and Addicks.  These are all breaker outages generally related to re-energization of the high kV (read: big) lines.  

- All of the major 345kV lines have been back while one major 138kV line crossing town from 290/610 through the Heights to Beaumont remains out in two sections.  This work was scheduled to come back last night at 2200 and did not, no new estimate.

- One major 345kV xfmr is out of service near 290/610 along the aforementioned string coming out of the Heights.  This is not expected to return until 1700 on 7/13 (end of Saturday).  This may be one of the reasons CNP is giving guidance for restorations continuing into Sunday.

- While I know this all sucks so bad, the line crews did an pretty good job of restoring the high kV lines ahead of schedules in most cases.  The problem is increasingly going to the last few miles of low kV distribution lines that feed your street.  That means each line fixed is increasingly less 'bang for the buck' in terms of customers restored, simply because they've hit most of the big ones.

-------------------

UPDATE3:  2140 on 7/10:

- lines from Addicks to WP/BW8 to Bellaire returned to service

- major breaker in south Pasadena returned to service

- the crosstown work may have hit snags with the middle section that traverses the Heights still scheduled for outage ending 7/10 2200 so that work is likely to be moved to tomorrow.  This includes a major xfmr at 610/290 that is scheduled to come back 7/13 1700

Points to remember:

- major lines feed the smaller lines.  This is all information about major lines, not the lines that go to your house or even feed your neighborhood.  These are big big lines that are the backbone of the system.

- lines going out of service is normal, particularly when things need to be de-energized to fix them.  Most of the time de-energizations happen and you never even know it because other lines handle the change but right now it's very possible to gain power and then lose it again.  I know that it incredibly frustrating, but it's really the only way.

- most work is likely moving to the distribution network where visibility drops.  Currently it looks like they plan to wrap up major work by end of Saturday although that may easily move.

- likely outages will be updated and new plans come out overnight from the work this evening.

--------------------

UPDATE2: 1635 on 7/10:

- lines from Addicks to WP/BW8 to Bellaire are out of service as expected, given a return time of 1900 tonight.  We'll see.  If you lost power this afternoon along those areas, that's probably why.

- work on a major crosstown 138kV line through the Heights to Crosby is going out this evening (1630) and expected back at 2200.  This is likely to go out or may already be out, hopefully come back later tonight.

- some major work on the east side near the ship channel finished.

- work near 290/BW8 Cyprus area finished early (was slated for 7/12)

------------------
EDIT, UPDATE as of 1225 on 7/10:

- a new string of outages is planned in West Houston for **this afternoon**.  If you live in the regions of Westpark/59, Westpark/BW8, Eldridge from West Park north to Addicks, this whole string of lines may be out this afternoon.  Be aware you may lose power in these areas, hard to say.  This is associated with with updated Addicks breaker outage today.  If you are around these areas and do not have power, it is possible it will come back for some this evening if these outages finish.  

- 59 / Fannin / Main has an outage most of the day tomorrow

- an important outage in Bellaire is scheduled to come back at 1300 today but appears to be behind schedule.

- work is active across Galveston with many of the high kV lines to and on the island on intraday outage.

FYI the utility crews work super-hard during events like this, particularly the mutual assistance crews from out-of-state.  Don't yell at these poor guys, it's not their particular fault, they just fix things.  Please treat them like the semi-heros they are.

------------------------

What I can tell you from high-level ERCOT data as of 0920 on 7/10:

- most of the major 345kV lines (biggest size used in ERCOT) across the city have been restored, some ahead of schedule.  This includes lines into Bellaire and from Westpark/BW8 to 290/610.  Lines north from Humble to Tomball have come back as have major lines in Baytown.  Many of the 138kV (second-biggest size) have returned as well.

- some major 138kV lines extending to Galveston remain out past their initial expected return date, new estimates not yet provided.

- there are a lot of breaker outages that are schedule to be completed today.  These actions can often involve people with power losing it for a period to de-energize / re-energize a section of line.  I know this is the most frustrating thing in the world to lose power again but it is part of the process to restore the grid and must be done.

- those same breaker outages are now getting scheduled into tomorrow as well.  Often this implies a schedule of work that is increasingly being known.  Knowing what to do is the first step and largely that process seems to be complete.

- some breaker and xfmr outages have been extended, most stubbed dates are currently 7/12 or 7/13.  Consider those placeholders, they have been changing a lot with several lines scheduled for 7/12 returns back already.

- this is all at the high kV line level.  I cannot tell you anything about zip codes or neighborhoods or individual distribution lines.  However fixing the big branches is the next step, then smaller lines.

I just want to say that I have gotten far more communication from CenterPoint re: trying to sell me gas line insurance than I have about the outage in my neighborhood.
"The lack of communication is I think the thing we’ve strapped with the most. No map to see what’s going on with power. No estimated times for restoration, etc. 

No idea how bad it was at my place because haven’t been able to watch any news today, etc"
[deleted]
Centerpoint restoration seems to have stalled over last hour.
"FUCKING HELL. If CenterPoint would just tell us approximately when to expect power back, we could make informed decisions like whether to leave or not. I don’t want to load two little kids and a screaming cat in the car, drive for four hours to get to the closest hotel, then drop an extra couple hundred bucks on a room just to find out that our power was restored two hours after we left."
[deleted]
"Use the WhataBurger app, shows which establishments are out/on and is better than the CenterPoint tracker in a lot of instances"
77058 just came on. Clear Lake
still nothing off 1960 near willowbrook in NW cypress 77070 :/
Any tips for what to do with animals in the event power isn’t restored? I can power through but worried about my cats.  Besides plenty of water for them to drink
"77009 

I can’t do another 6 days without power, I genuinely might have to hit up my ex and tell her I’m sorry if it comes down to that long without power.

It’s so infuriating seeing power around me be restored. At least I could go to one of the local bars."
Tracker says 951k restored since Beryl. Who wants to bet it magically shoots up to their 1 million goal right before midnight?
"Ppl out here dying bro im at 7625 hammely blvd, and a lady died upstairs she didn't have her breathing machine"
"Make sure to keep updating the thread when your power turns back on guys. Maybe I'm missing them, but I haven't seen anything in the past few hours about a new location getting power back. We have enough people from all across Houston to PROVE that CenterPoint isn't doing their job. They claim they are working ""16 hours shifts"" and I personally think that's a load of garbage."
Just discovered from a FB group that someone has created a Google form for Houstonians to report power status. The [map](https://digital-client.com/) updates once an hour. Centerpoint can suck it.
"It's Friday and I have no idea if I'll get power today, or in August.

Heck of a job, Centerpoint."
This updated map is a complete JOKE!!!!
Why remove the thread that was strictly for people regaining power? Everyone saying they're still in the dark just makes it harder to find helpful information.
"I'm in 77006, midtown. A good chunk of us are without power, me since 6am. I feel like a lot of people have it, so I think they are moving on to larger fixes that can power more people. I would imagine they are just swatting big numbers. But, I am just going off of acedotal Ike."
"I know they are working through the night, but is that preliminary work to help them for tomorrow, or do I have a chance of all my lights turning on at 1am?"

"ERCOT updated outages this evening, most got new dates of 7/12 1700 return to service from original stubs of 7/9 1700.  Some equipment came back today, including two big 345kV lines across the city.  Scheduled outages for tomorrow are likely necessary to re-energize portions of west Houston around i10w/bw8 and around Pasadena and Humble all around 1300 tomorrow.  Big lines remain out in west Houston, Bellaire, and Deer Park.  Galveston saw some lines come back but major 138kV's remain out.  Outage ticket times are guesses in these cases, don't take them too seriously.

This information comes from ERCOT's MIS system which is somewhat archaic and difficult to use.

Sorry I don't have better news."
"77477 , 48 hours without power. Pray for me, i got a pregnant wife. All the other buildings in my complex have power besides ours. Some next level bullshit."
77008 - Heights and 18th power JUST came back on. Spread the word
"Bro, *where are the linemen?*"
"Drove around a bit and have not seen a single repair truck today. 

What the fuck are they even doing?"
I just moved here literally 7/1 from Buffalo ny. In Buffalo I have been thru blizzards with way more damage and wind.. and I have never in my life experienced a place with power that goes so easily. Put some power lines in the mega road structures every dollar is being wasted on. This is infuriating
"Any updates for heights 77008

Update : still no damn power"
"I still can’t believe I’m going through another Ike sweat fest 16 years later for a cat 1 hurricane. Our utilities infrastructure quality has regressed unchecked. 

Edit: 77035 Orange Gang rise up"
"Please email this thread to media, upload it to a server and print hard copies before you take it down. By the time anyone cares to have formal investigations, both txlege and centerpointless will have asses covered."
Well strap in for another night...
Day 5 and don't even have so much as an ETA. Fuck Centerpoint
77077 energy corridor. Had a power outage since 6:30am. Just received power now at 10pm
Still no power in 77019 Montrose area. It is now 1:02 am. No power for about 14 hours.
[deleted]
"So at 8AM, CenterPoint said there were almost 1,400,000 customers without power. The latest update says that they've restored power to ONLY 28,000 people. This is absurd."
"So if my location doesn't have an estimated time of restoration, I should give up all hope for tonight, right?"
Got an email from CP stating power was back on. Online my account says the power is on. I drove to my house and the power is still out. Enraging.
"77055 I’m fucking losing it man. 6 days no power post derecho. Day I get power my dad fucking dies and now this. Fuck center point, fuck abbott fuck them all I can’t keep this up man"
77024 woke up with my power back at around 3am.
"The ""customers restored in the last 24 hours"" metric is falling pretty quickly"
"You should leave this up for another TWO weeks, given that there will still be people waiting by then."
"77471 Rosenberg finally has power, I want to freaking cry.

Don't trust them lads, once things calm down start saving up for a generator and window AC. A lot of us might be good now but I don't trust them to be ready the next time a storm comes along. But more importantantly vote. them. Out!

Never again are we sleeping drenched in sweat desperately calling every overbooked hotel in a 100 mile radius thanks to these bozos."
The lack of updates over night and into the morning is distressing.
"Lord its raining again. I never got power back, I'm just gonna assume I won't get power back for yet another week at this point."
"77077 energy corridor, briar forest Eldridge area. Power on as of 2:19 pm 7/12. Im at a hotel but my ring camera is on and I can see that my modem is on. Hope everyone else in the area gets their power soon🤞"
“Pending review”….man fuck
"If ""restoration date pending review"" means ""sometime after July 19th"" I'm going to throw literal shit at Centerpoint execs."
I'm in the Humble area 77396...completely pitch black and sounding like jurassic park outside with the insects.
77071 without power for about 20 hrs. Center point says that by WEDNESDAY they’ll have 1M back in service but there’s close to 2M without power. I’m frustrated 🤕
77006 by substation on tuam/fairview power back on woo!!!!! Instead of sad drinking we are happy drinking!!!! Woooooo!!!!!
"77007 Washington/Memorial - still no power or running water. Is any one else without water, or am I just in an unlucky pocket? All businesses and other apt complexes around me have power tho"
"Anecdotally, it seems like the repairs are slowing down.  Only one of my friends had their power restored."
77060 but I don’t mind waiting. My heart goes out to those most at risk and with pets. I’ll live.
"Welp, looks like another night of sweating. Turns out the first 3 houses on our side of the street have power so the problem is a particular post behind the 3rd neighbors house. We've been classified as light green or mostly energized so I imagine we aren't priority and won't get power till next week. Fuck Centerpoint."
"Mom in Richmond, I’m in Westchase, no power. Sister just outside River Oaks has power, but no water. How a nearly non-hurricane did this makes no sense to this lifelong Houstonian."
"I'm in 77096. My neighbors across the street from me have power and those on my side do not. There are countless instances of this exact same thing all across Houston, and it really makes no sense.
CenterPoint admitted they weren't prepared because ""the storm was worse than predicted"". I'm sorry, but during the time of year when we regularly hit TRIPLE DIGITS in temperature, you'd think these morons over at CenterPoint would prepare for the worst.
While I'm writing this because I'm bored and don't have shit else to do, I also think someone needs to be held accountable for this mess.
Almost 1.5 million people are still without power."
Anyone know any updates on Harris County areas because this is ridiculous.
77057 by the galleria and we’ve been out of power since monday 9:30am currently 5:44am tuesday and woke up sweating. i really worry about my cats and how they’ll do tomorrow:(
Got the email from Centerpoint in 77063 saying our power was restored. Tis a lie.
77008 behind Torchy's...power on!
"77090, no power. Been here for Allison, Ike, Rita, all of them. I've never been without power this long. In a hotel that I can't afford and I started vacation today. Thankful I don't have to work during this time but bitter I can't spend it in my apt. "
"Yall I cannot

I haven't slept a wink all night, just crying and be nauseated. I'm sleeping on a palette in my parents bedroom. They're running a portable ac unit off a generator. Even then somehow I managed to either get upset to my stomach or get heat exhaustion

I just need someone to talk to in the darkness. My parents are asleep:("
F\*ck centerpoint and their negligent behavior and intentional lack of transparency.
"As of 7/11 8:40PM…:.They are shutting power back off in some areas in Missouri City, drove by whataburger and it was pitch black…(it was opened yesterday)….I politely drove home and laid back down In the DARK. ATT Internet is down, can’t work from home, TMOBLE cellphone towers down , operating on LTE …can’t call customer service without having to repeat each word over and over and over again. Bout to lay in the dark and suck my thumb 👍!!!!"
77064 power out again… HAHAHAHAHA what a joke… you have to laugh to stop yourself from crying… fucking ridiculous
so… does anyone know the likelihood of someone in a “partially energized” area getting power back any time soon if there aren’t even people out working on the downed lines yet…? because their map is starting to look more like centerpoint jerking themselves off marking outages as restored because a couple of commercial buildings have power on the circuit 😭
for giving “substantially everyone” an estimation there’s still a lot of people with no ETA on that map.
Bru my shit say july 12 … its 10:47pm u mfs im STILL IN THE DARK
"77008 14th street near heights high school - electric crew said everything here is fixed, they are just running tests for safety to turn it all back on today - guess we'll wait and see

For reference, this area is marked on the centerpoint map as needing review for restoration date and was previously marked ""energized"""
77008 no power. In laws in 77005 no power. Really contemplating heading to the hill country tomorrow to stay with my parents.
77006 Centerpoint trucks spotted in the northeast quadrant of Montrose. One was stopped on Avondale
[deleted]
Centerpoint on break? The tracker has been stuck at 1.36 million since I woke up at 6.
77007 near cleveland park. Saw a guy working on the electricity lines! Here’s hoping it gets fixed today
"The guy who commented a few hours ago with some insider info on transmission line repairs has added a noteworthy update to his comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/lcik1fn/

> ""a new string of outages is planned in West Houston for this afternoon. If you live in the regions of Westpark/59, Westpark/BW8, Eldridge from West Park north to Addicks, this whole string of lines may be out this afternoon. Be aware you may lose power in these areas, hard to say. This is associated with with updated Addicks breaker outage today. If you are around these areas and do not have power, it is possible it will come back for some this evening if these outages finish."""
"77096 Meyerland, South Braeswood at Rice. Many businesses have power but our neighborhood does not. We lost power on Monday at 7:38 AM. Center Point sucks balls. Edit: A word and Center Point sucks hairy balls."
"The transmission-line insider guy added another update to his comment this morning: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/lcik1fn/

> UPDATE4: 0915 on 7/11:

> * Not a ton of changes overnight, mainly times updated for work going on today. Work end around noontime in areas: Greenspoint, Lake Houston/BW8, central Pasadena, 59/Fannin (ends 1700), and Addicks. These are all breaker outages generally related to re-energization of the high kV (read: big) lines.

> * All of the major 345kV lines have been back while one major 138kV line crossing town from 290/610 through the Heights to Beaumont remains out in two sections. This work was scheduled to come back last night at 2200 and did not, no new estimate.

> * One major 345kV xfmr [transformer] is out of service near 290/610 along the aforementioned string coming out of the Heights. This is not expected to return until 1700 on 7/13 (end of Saturday). This may be one of the reasons CNP is giving guidance for restorations continuing into Sunday.

> * While I know this all sucks so bad, the line crews did an pretty good job of restoring the high kV lines ahead of schedules in most cases. The problem is increasingly going to the last few miles of low kV distribution lines that feed your street. That means each line fixed is increasingly less 'bang for the buck' in terms of customers restored, simply because they've hit most of the big ones."
Starting to think 77024 is one of the worst zip codes to live in when it comes to losing power . . . Last time when the derecho hit we were out of power for like 6 days
The number of affected customers has been going *up* this morning. 
77007 by St Thomas High School - no power still
Is CP just randomly changing outage map to green and increasing numbers of restored customers in the tracker? Wtf 😂
"Day 6 of no power, ""energized"" with no power, not a single electrical truck on the road. I don't know how everyone in Richmond/Rosenberg has power, but us. Genuinely wondering if legal action can be taken at this point."
You would think with so many people having power again the rest of the repairs would go faster since theres more people to work on things... 
77498 Fort Bend still out. Been out since 5am
"Pinehurst area, 77355 (magnolia). Pitch black, no T-Mobile data at all. Drove into Tomball and as soon as I crossed into Harris County, the lights and cell internet are on.

New Zealand came in just fine on Shortwave radio tonight."
No power in 77479 (Sugar Land) for 24 hours now. We have guests from out of town. Welcome to Texas!
77007 power came back a few minutes ago. Enjoying the ceiling fan while I can. Hope it stays on long enough for the AC to do some work.
POWER RESTORED TO MY NEIGHBORHOOD IN 77033! YIPPEEEE
"77092 and feeling like I'm one of those unlucky ones part of the 'nested outage' since 80% of neighbors have had lights since Tuesday. I just wish I knew what the time line for fixing everything was, feeling so sick of all the sweaty, dark waiting."
77003 power restored. We need to talk about holding centerpoint accountable.
"***Update**** 

Power back on but not all houses on Dickson unfortunately (per my HOA)


77007 still nothing (right by St. Thomas HS). I was already planning to move but am in the middle of fixing a few things up with a contractor. This experience makes me realize I don’t care if I sell at a loss, I’m gtfo. I moved here the year of Harvey and I’m leaving with Beryl."
[deleted]
"After nearly 190 hours, power is finally back on at 77004 near 288/mcgowen"
"Centerpoint is saying that they'll be up to 1 million restored ~~tomorrow~~ by EOD Wednesday. Right now they're just under 300k from the initial 2.2m, so you have about 35-40% odds of getting your power restored by then if you're still out."
77504 power came back and then 40 mins later a branch fell and cut our power FML
"Hot, sweaty miserable. My freezer is leaking everywhere. Will have to toss a bunch of food! For the 3rd time in a year. I feel like shit. Didn’t sleep a wink. I am so fucking angry right now. Also just learned that Centerpoint is just now starting to send out crews… 26 hours later. Fuck everything right now lol."
Where the Phuck are all the center point truck repairs when no one can find them anywhere repairing 
At least 3 admits to our medical service today related to no AC. Bullshit. Our elderly and sick deserve better.
"77008 lost power around 9am, still nothing"
"77007, pls tell me it's possible to get power turned on during the night. I'm trying to cool off any way I know how, but I can't sleep and I have an elderly parent with me. 
I know there are 3 cooling centers open for tomorrow, but does anyone know of any more ? "
Power just came on at 12:45 am in 77062.
"77054, still out :("
77056 - my apartment complex has power back! Got the email about 30 minutes ago.
"Just got a Center point text saying our power was restored, which is FALSE."
77006 near Rudyards. No power for my whole street yet. We all lost it about 10 AM yesterday. All the houses and business around us have power. It’s maddening.
[deleted]
77006 in a small pocket of three houses + a parking lot with no power but literally everyone around us is lit up 😭. Worried about my cats.
"77379 right by KHS still no power 50 hours in. We’ve done a good bit of driving around and have not seen a single utility truck on the roads, in parking lots, or working in the areas we have driven through."
"No power still in my area. Ironically tho I’m driving down Wesleyan towards the Greenway Plaza Costco and encounter several downed lines just laying in the right lane of the road only to see about a dozen lineman trucks with dudes inside just chilling in the Costco parking lot less than a minute drive away.

I know these dudes are there and ready to work. How the fuck is CP management failing this bad at organizing their labor?"
77008 any updates near 14th? We’re starting to get nauseous and the pets aren’t eating. This is WITH a generator and window unit. It’s still 89 in here
I'm about to crash out
Would be nice if any linemen were lurking here on a dinner break and could give some info.
"77098 no power still.. we are literally one of the  buildings within our complex that still doesnt have power. They have no clue when itll be resolved.

Happy for our neighbors and I’m trying to remain positive, but its starting to get to me 🥹"
77379 - still no power :(. I'm tired of this.
[deleted]
77066 - We're free. Power is on.
77056 still no power since Monday 9am and it’s Tuesday 2:50am now 😩
"77095, lost power at around 6-7am .. came back on at about 6pm and then back out again at around 8pm. It’s 3:30am now and still out 😢"
"77077, power just clicked on at 5 am. I've never been happier!"
Supposedly the crews that finally made it are getting their safety briefing this morning. We should start seeing power restored soon (slowly)
77095 checking again. No power but went out and drove some and zero sign of centerpoint trucks. Love it
Crying in 77450 Cinco Ranch/Highland knolls. Some areas around Kingsland seem to have power but nothing here. Finally pulled the trigger on a generator—-I don’t want to do this again! Dogs and cats and humans are all miserable 😭.
My entire street in the Heights is green on the map but I don’t have power and in fact have a downed line in my yard. How can I make sure I’m not passed over? I am terrified they think I have power somehow because all of my neighbors do
Taking my dog to a friends house in San Marcos. Very thankful for the people in my life. Keep your pets safe. 
"They changed the map sometime this afternoon. Energized got broken into ""energized"" and ""energized with potential nested outage"". Most of what was energized was migrated into the second category, of course"
"66hrs still no power spring 77379 wires blocking the entrance northwest memorial, 0 work done ."
"77077 - briar forest and d. ashford - still no power as of 5am Monday.
The neighborhood across from us - 77079 - never lost power. We’re staying with them until power gets restored or until they kick us out.. whichever comes first.

I haven’t seen a single service truck all week. I’ve been going back and forth cleaning, emptying the refrigerator, checking mail, etc.


I have a hunch CP over extended themselves from the last storm and the linemen are hesitant to return due to open/unpaid invoices. That’s just my opinion. I work in the services industry."
77036 Forum Park still in the dark it’s crazy. 90° inside the buildings when it’s 9PM at night. Madness. ^FUCKCENTERPOINT
"It's 12 PM. Tick-tock, Centerpoint."
"Power flickered twice here, just wow. 77008"
"77006 (Montrose). Had power restored early Wednesday. My parents (77346) had power restored Wednesday but lost it for ~2 hours today before it came back on. Brother (77346, in the same neighborhood my parents are in) got power back about 15 minutes ago. Sister (77396) still has no power. Xfinity is still out for everyone.   

Driving home from work today, I'd say >50% of street lights remain out, including multiple downtown intersections on Louisiana; Westheimer and Montrose; and West Gray and Waugh. Be careful -- asswipes are running intersections left and right without even pretending to stop. I messaged my boss I'm not coming in tomorrow. It's not worth it. 

Side note: I gassed up on Friday at $3.49/gallon for premium. Today I paid $4.59."
Still no power in 77040. I’m pissed because people down the street have power but not here
Well.. this storm just set us back 😩 i saw 3 lineman working 77090 then boom.. gone 😭😭😭😭
77024. By Chimney Rock and I-10. No one is even in the area lmao. Leaving Houston after this.
I was in the partially energized zone of the map until now. They have us in that shade of teal that is pending date
77373 - Some houses have power
"On a walk this morning I saw at least 6 work trucks in a very small area, east of Heights between 20th and 17th. Hopefully y'all get it back real soon."
77017 near Hobby Airport/Pasadena still down since 6am…..praying that sleep takes me soon and that I wake up to AC lol
Whataburgers always have power. We should just put them in charge of the grid honestly. They’d probably do a better job than Centerpoint.
"CenterPoint has not done a good job keeping us updated.  Clear and specific information that we were used to during previous outages has been replaced with generic ""updates"" this time around.  It's frustrating that CenterPoint took down the outage map.  It feels like the company is withholding information."
The Whataburger app coming in clutch is something I did not expect lmao
Feeling depressed I don't want to go through another night with no power I have work I can't clean my uniform or take a shower. I can't book a room with no availability and I can't leave town. I feel like a trapped rat. 77011
I can’t believe a category 1 took the power out for this long. I just moved to Houston in May from Florida 🥲
"> Based on current progress with its damage assessment and initial restoration, CenterPoint now expects to have 1 million impacted customers restored by the end of the day on Wednesday, July 10.

So not even half the people are expected to have power by end of Wednesday according to them"
"77024 @ Memorial & Chimney Rock. No power since the early AM. Took 6 days to get power back after the derecho, but I’m hopeful we’ll get it sooner this time around"
[deleted]
77095 still out. Not a truck in sight. And my solar fans just died after running like champs since the outage. But I can’t recharge until sun comes up. It’s so hot and stuffy in here. I feel so gross.
77007 still no power
The number of customers affected went up 😭
"77008, W 23rd and Bevis

Just got power back. Looks like the updates from the crews being there was accurate."
[deleted]
It would help a lot if when posting your status you include the closest major intersection.
77459 - neighborhood near HEB on Austin parkway + hwy6 has power 
any updates on 77008?
"The insider guy who commented about transmission lines this morning added another update to his comment, about 45min ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/lcik1fn/

> UPDATE2: 1635 on 7/10:

> * lines from Addicks to WP/BW8 to Bellaire are out of service as expected, given a return time of 1900 tonight. We'll see. If you lost power this afternoon along those areas, that's probably why.

> * work on a major crosstown 138kV line through the Heights to Crosby is going out this evening (1630) and expected back at 2200. This is likely to go out or may already be out, hopefully come back later tonight.

> * some major work on the east side near the ship channel finished.

> * work near 290/BW8 Cyprus area finished early (was slated for 7/12)"
"For those in 77008, I’m driving to dinner and I saw a bunch of out of state utility trucks near 11th street park, and another set near ETC Jester and Wynnwood"
"77054, 8181 Fannin St, power was back at 6 pm. Thank you to the lineworkers (men and women) who worked under high temperatures the entire day. Hope that everyone here will get their power back soon."
77070 my 249ers and cypresswood ppl we are back up 🎉🎉🎉🎉
77379 near grand parkway and kuykendahl. Still no power despite the whataburger and other businesses across the way having it :'(
77008 back on at 7 PM on Wednesday at Shepherd and 16th
"77477. Of course, the Starbucks and Mcdonalds right behind my house have power and stay blasting their bright ass lights through my windows.

Sleeping on my roof in nothing but my undies has been quite pleasant, though. I've been getting stares from the McD's drive thru, but fuck em."
77007 washington ave still no power…
77007 near Cleveland park. I see repair crew! However they are not center point - I guess they are contracting in some outside help? These pics were taken on Jackson hill https://imgur.com/a/wo7nlGs
"77379 So much for Centerpoint providing restoration times on it's ""restoration status tracker"" before noon today as promised. No updates to the shitty map since 7am. Not that I'm surprised."
"Centerpoint said they'd have estimated times to fix power, where is that supposed to be at?"
[deleted]
I'm seeing that some of you guys have gotten estimates on when your power will come back; where are y'all getting them? Was it an email from Centerpoint?
just got power back on 77459 near Lexington/dulles!
"Still no power 77007. It’s time to start bombarding them with calls https://fletcher.house.gov/forms/form/?ID=103
7133538680 can everyone start calling their rep and whoever else they can think of? This is absurd. At least we can be a pain in the ass or a mild irritation to these people who don’t give a f if thousands start calling nonstop?? I don’t see any other alternative besides the French way but we need to take our anger outside of this app and put it directly on those who are supposed to do something. Like they shouldn’t have the phone stop ringing for a minute until this is over. If you were in office, isn’t that what you’d be expecting?"
seems they don’t get much done overnight.
"77019 - Power restored (at least on La Rue street by Waugh & W. Dallas). 

FYI - we’ve been in blue since they released the map. They never gave an estimate for when power would be restored. The map still shows us as blue. 

I feel so so grateful 😭😭 I’m praying all my fellow Houstonians/texans get their power restored ASAP! This was hell "
[deleted]
Yeahhhh the storm that's blowing through NWHouston rn is giving me major anxiety.  I'll probably have a meltdown if my power goes out again...
77063 hopeless 😩 
"We are live in 77007, Yale & Washington"
"77092 @ Magnum and Pinemont

I'm done with today. Just chased half a Xanax with a shot of tequila.

Hoping to wake up tmrw with power but not holding my breath."
"77007, Washington Ave. across from Porta'Vino. No power or water since ~9:30 A.M. Monday."
Serious question: how the fuck has a state of emergency/disaster not been called yet? Nearly 50% of the population loses power in sure people could use those resources such as FEMA etc at this point. This city is so frustrating sometimes.
"50% of Entergy customers are supposed to be back on by Wednesday evening. 

For reference, when Beryl was a category 4 that hit Jamaica, 45% of JPS (Jamaica’s power company) customers had power within 24 hours.

How on earth is the 4th largest city in the US and “energy capital” doing worse than an island for power restoration? Maybe I should move back to the East coast…"
No hate but it's unhelpful to say power is up in your zip without a cross street or landmark.
77036 power went out around 6am and i don't have power back yet.
77004.  Down since 9:30 am and not back on yet
77006 still out despite the people across the street having power. can’t even bother trying to reach centerpoint. what a jokep
"77009, lost power shortly after 8 this morning and haven’t gotten it back."

"77006, still no power but got a power spike at 3:50ish"
77008 no power since 9:30 yesterday
77459 - I saw crews working at the towers by hightower high school
"77074 Shapstown bellaire side, we're still out of power, and it keeps getting hotter. I'm hoping it comes back today. Looks like I'm missing spain v france in the Euros. Damn it."
77006 - Power is ON! Camden Midtown (Milam and Louisiana at Hadley). And there was much rejoicing.
[deleted]
So did anyone get power back during the night last night? Like is it possible that they’re working overnight or do we give up hope until tomorrow? Thanks!
77056 everyone in neighborhoods around us has power but we’re still without 🥺
"77066: contractors (?) in trucks marked ""Premium"" spotted. Two small fleets, both near Hobby Lobby on FM 1960. At around 8:30 am, one group was having a very large huddle/meeting. We hope they will fix residential power in short order..."
I think they forgot about 77057. All three of the closest traffic lights are out and I‘m over here with nothing but a tiny fan and little power bank keeping me cool slowly losing the will to live
Anyone else see the restoration counter on the outage tracker just jump from 985k to 1 mill mere minutes before the 5 pm deadline? Can't make this shit up.
77006 just got home to confirm. Hallelujah
77008 near SPJST Lodge just got power back
"77008 - Spoke to a lineman, the repairs don’t start until tomorrow morning."

(77070)Another day sleeping in the car since there’s no power in our area but few blocks away got power 😔😩
77007 near Cleveland park still out 😡
77069/Willowbrook area here. Does anyone have any updates specifically for that part of 1960?
77008 checking in at TC and Bevis and power is back
"77003. No power, going on day four. A shit sandwich "
"77459 - Just did a drive around Sienna. There is gas available at the HEB on 6, the Shell just into Sienna and the Valero on the corner of Hwy 6 and Sienna Ranch. As for power, the stores on Hwy 6, at the front of Sienna, and the apartments around the Shell gas station all have power. On Sienna Ranch there was power on one side of the road, spanning from Sienna Springs to Fort Bend Tollway, had power, along with the apartments near Hwy 6.

I saw linemen working near the Shell, as well as the substation on Mount Logan, just after the roundabout.

Small update: there is still a lineman truck at the Mount Logan substation"

"77388 still no power, although its been blue since yesterday. Also areas around our neighborhood are expected to be back up by end of day tomorrow…."
Ah great. This little rain is gonna turn into a 24 hour lunch break for Centercrap.
77096 JUST GOT POWER BACK ON!!
77571 - There was a large tree blocking the only BOULEVARD in and out of our neighborhood. Neighbor just texted the tree is gone and what appeared to be guys starting line work.
"77339 no power, no hope"
"77069 - champions forest & cypresswood area. Mom just got power back!! So happy for her & everyone else getting power back :) 

hoping 77098 gets power back soon 🤞"

77042 - Power just came back. Hold strong friends.
77447- the map is saying energized but no one in my neighborhood has power. What should be done? I know people have said the map is inaccurate but now it is showing estimated dates for restoration. Ours is just saying energized when that is not the case.
New map says we’re energized in 77012 and 77061 but totally dark. I fucking give up.
Bro how tf does everyone outside my neighborhood have power and and just my neighborhood doesn’t complete and utter bull shiiiii
77007 near St Thomas HS. Still no power. Fuckity fuckin dark ages and shit
I’m 90% sure it’s just a transformer that needs replacing. Why is it taking so long?
"77379 - bunch of linemen staged in the parking lot of the Klein ISD therapeutic and readiness center, im near the elementary school here and without power. A tree Batista bombed a pole and took out another across the street."
77008 15th and Columbia just got power. Hope y’all still waiting get help soon.
77054 got power back today. latest map estimated it'll be the 17th. just letting everyone know to disregard what centerpoint puts out.
"Not getting power until Friday wtf man life sucks but aleast there's a date for me, somebody probably already robbed my house already because eveyone left my neighborhood to go somewhere else I'm going to check on it today"
77023. Just got a call from CP my expected restoration time is Friday by end of day. End me please.
"[Here is the update from CenterPoint](https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/releases/Hurricane_Beryl_7.8.24%20PM_Final.pdf)

So this is what it felt like living in Houston pre AC.
taking a sweaty dump as I type this in the dark. FML
"77090 still no power. Nobody cares. Not a single lineman, repair crew or truck. Crickets. 
I honestly think they've forgotten about us and once Centerpointless was done with that 1 million restored on Wednesday they just went back to their usual uncomplicated lives.


This is one very very fucked up city. Houston weak should be the new slogan."
Sorry if this has been shared already but here is a [self-reported outage map](https://digital-client.com/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR1XPyE9cGc23BJzIsNOZLJ6bLDSp2X_iIlt67TOXpR2dhOoCvHJkNU10eE_aem_vEXzpOW63Wfm46k0hNSK1w&mibextid=UyTHkb) that seems to be more accurate than Centerpoint’s
Can we all band together and just not pay Centerpoint this month?
 77095 still out. Hoping for the best th
"https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/


I have no idea if these numbers are just made up, but if accurate there has been steady but very slow progress over the past 6-8 hours."
No pour in 77058 since 4:30am yesterday. It’s been over 24 hours and it’s just gonna get hotter 🥲
77007 near St Thomas High School had power come on for 20 seconds and then it shut off again.  Hopefully it comes back soon.
"77388 which is kuykendahl to i45 in spring, still has no power. The heb and shopping areas have power, but the neighborhoods and apartment complexes are still out."
77070 still without power to my knowledge. I hope we're not part of the multiple days club...
77095 Copper lakes. Centerpoint truck just drove by. They waved at us PLEASEEEEEEEEEE PLEASEEEEEEEE
"Saw two line trucks on the corner of Cullen and Leland, hopefully 77003 and 77023 will be back soon"
Got power back but now xfinity is down suddenly.
Accepted I may not get power till like Friday probably at this point. Anyone have ANY tips to cool down when trying to sleep. I’m all sticky and sweating profusely. My feet are on fire!
"77070


Still no power in my building but several buildings around me have power. At least my complex's office has power so I have somewhere to charge phone and power bank. The animal clinic i work at has power so if anyone needs help with their pet in 77433 area, pm me for the phone number. As far as I know, we're only seeing sick patients since our vaccines had to be thrown out. "
Probably about 10-12 linesman utility trucks at the shopping center at 1960 and breck at in champions area I just saw. Might be working on that area today. 77066 area code btw
77070 still no power and cell service still bad.  Drove around last night and most traffic lights were not working.  Lakewood Forest area.  Kroger on Grant and Louetta had power and was open last night.  The gas stations that were open had no gas or bags of ice as of last night.
77008 - 23rd & East side of Yale got power back about 5 minutes ago.
Anyone around 77025 Southside Place need a food or water run? Happy to deliver something between my meetings today.
"77007 Cottage Grove - just reported a downed line that was pretty hidden away and I think had gone unnoticed until now. Centerpoint said they’d send a crew ASAP, but we’ll see what happens……"
Stafford SW Houston 77477 area POWER UP 7/11/24 about 4AM
77095 just got power! Hope everyone else gets theirs back soon!! I love seeing how united we've been in calling out bs. I really wanna keep this energy going forward bc I keep learning more and more about all this bs affecting us and I don't want to go back to just being clueless
That map isn’t accurate. Updated or not it shows that my work doesn’t have power but im here and it does. Thank god cuz it says my home won’t be restored until 7/14 and I refuse to believe that.
Anyone have an update for 77055 specifically by Kroger? I really don’t get why Kroger and the community center don’t have power. It is a missed opportunity to not give the community center power and make it a cooling center for people.
"77077 Dairy Ashford/Westheimer area in the Energy Corridor. Lost power 530am Monday. I drove 2 hours away to get myself and my baby to a hotel and have no contacts in the area. Have been checking my AT&T smart home manager app to see if my internet modem is back online to check for power. About 20 minutes ago, it was showing my modem back online and was getting good speeds. Then it went back offline about 7 minutes later. Seems like power came back and shut off again unless it had a power surge and quacked out. It is not plugged into a surge protector."
"77389 - just received this message from off-point

My house in Champions Point Village II is still without power, but the corner store on Bourgeois and Hollister has power as do the traffic lights at that intersection and at Theall & Hollister.

Swanny's at Hollister & Theall is lit up, and the business parks along Theall are all energized.

Give me hope our subdivision will get power today.  I saw a LOT of bucket trucks going north on Hollister."
Back at work in 77008 with no power in a dark and hot warehouse. It's depressing driving through a city in ruins just to work in this shithole building.
"77008 update near high school on 14th - no power yet but crews finally working on removing a large tree sitting on some lines behind a house - really hoping that's been the problem

UPDATE - still no power"
"Jfc... I work from home and just got an alert from IT: ""your computer hasn't backed up in a while and we wanted to check that it's working"" I let them know I'm in the area still without power because of the hurricane and the response was basically ""ok well just ping us when that passes"""
"77386, got power back yesterday afternoon but it just went back out. I'm so done with this..."
"77096, beechnut and south rice just got power back"
77339- Bear Branch. I spoke to a line worker just now and he told me it would be until at least Monday til the power is back. He said it was some of the worst tree damage he had seen.
77379 - Cypresswood and Kuykendall. There's two snapped poles on front of the CVS. One still has part of a tree on it. Haven't seen any trucks come around yet.
We got power back on at 6:30 only for it to go out 20min later. 77088 zip code. New map says we’re energized. Also looks like some folks won’t be getting it back till Tuesday or later of next week. This is insane
77086 - new map says restoration pending review. If we're after the 19th me and my mom will for sure be dead by then
"Love being surrounded by dates and my building still rocks the ""Further review"" tag. Thank you Centerpoint. Really cool really chill. Love it."

WHY IS MY ETA THE 17TH
"77489. Power just came back. Was given no estimated time yesterday. And on today’s update was given until the EOD 17th. So I guess the map is kind of useless.


I did end up flagging down a CenterPoint lineman and asked what was being worked on near me and when I could get power back. He mentioned a tree was tangled on the line and that, that alone would make power return - unless something else major happened that hasn’t been discovered.


I will say, that we lost power at 2AM when Beryl made landfall and never even got a taste of electricity until today. I hope everyone else without it gets it soon, and if anyone needs assistance with anything hmu."
77459 Lake Olympia (or at least our part of it) has power again!! Just came back up about an hour ago and CP had sent us a text message that it would be back up by tomorrow. A day sooner than expected.
"77586 - Seabrook/El Lago.  Finally powered up after 6 long, miserable days.  During the final hookup this afternoon, the line to my complex needed a new switch because the one up there couldn't hold the voltage needed and the supervisor said it may not be tonight.  My heart sank, but luckily they were able to install one shortly after and we are in good shape.  My wife and our dog are at the hotel while I clean up the apartment, make sure everything works and spend some quality time with our cats who are currently fighting over who gets my lap. 

I hope those of you still without power are alright and you get restored soon.  I've been through Allison, Ike and Harvey prior.  Lost my apartment during Harvey.  This was still the worst one I've been through up to this point.  This sucked."
"Nested outages are fucked, I guess. We’re the only block in our neighborhood with no power (77084). Hit 0 when calling to talk to a human who told us our status was “waiting for crew assignment” before pausing and saying “so probably not today”. It’s a blown transformer with literally nothing around it. No damage. Just fucked. And the map won’t even give us a date because we’re “energized”."
"77373. Spring. The map shows us to be energized but no power here. The drone of the generators is still ongoing.


I cut the mains on and left all the other breakers off save on - the one that sends power to the back porch lights.


There are several bucket trucks driving around here right now. Fingers crossed!"
77007 power back at 11am this morning.
"77086 - got power back yesterday evening, slept 12 hours immediately"
77018 relief has never felt this good. Fingers crossed it stays!
Is there any way to find out an ETA from Center Point? We need to decide soon if we need to leave or stick it out. This is crazy. We’ve been without power for 38 hours.
"When you all can, start saving money so you can leave Texas. This will only get worse."
Just heard lightening. Everyone’s about to lose power again.
Rumor is that centerpoint has hundreds of trucks not yet deployed as it negotiates their pay.
77578 just got power
Out now for over 12 hours in 77098
77379 down since 6:45 am. Just enjoying the sound of all our neighbors generators
Nada in 77054
"https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/

centerpoint outage tracker
my neighborhood(77081) lost power like 4am, when Beryl got cause I randomly woke up at 5 and there was no power"
"77494 (on the very edge/inner-99 side): 2 streets in our neighborhood has power, but we do not. Traffic lights out at 99/westheimer but fully functional at westheimer/peek. 

We had centerpoint roll through our neighborhood 4 hours ago and then…. nothing for us."
77063 no power or water since 6am
"77041, West rd and 290, power restored 10:45."
"77069 - power has been out since 9 am. We have a generator running (I’m sharing it with my neighbors) but it’s hell without AC.  
Tomorrow I’ll decide if I’ll head to Austin"
77024 lost power around 6am still nothing
"77469 still no power since 6am and service has been spotty as hell, I've only been able to get so much as a Google search off maybe twice all day. Verizon."
Hopefully it’s back before it gets too much warmer 
"77084 one half of the apartment complex has power, the other doesn't... We on the side without it..."
"77023 still the only one without power on my street


Edit: it appears an air bnb behind my house is also without power. They are also sandwiched by folks with electricity"
"Friendswood, 77546. Haven’t had power since 7 AM Monday. I’m fucking miserable, attempting to sleep in my car. We’ll see if I run out of gas 🤷🏻‍♂️ drove around for 4 hours going to hotels / motels I thought were open or had a room but all were closed or had no power."
"GOOF area, lost power for a week in april, had to toss out everything in the fridge, ground hogs day all over again."
77038 no power still and I haven’t slept at all. It’s sooooo hot
77450 fort bend and i havent had power for over 27 hours. this is ridiculous
"77009, still no power as of now, going on 24 hours without.

Have not seen a single CenterPoint truck (or any other line crews) between the Heights and Katy."
77096 Still no power
77008. Just saw a bunch of centerpoint trucks drive by the hotel im at into the neighborhood. Hopefully a good sign.
"77090 no power since 8 am yesterday. Drove along 1960 from Kuykendahl to 45 yesterday afternoon, no traffic lights and no power anywhere. Found one Honduran restaurant open, waiting time was 45 minutes. Have not seen a single repair crew, truck, utility. Frustration is building up. 


77073 where I work does not have either power or water."
77389- spring/gosling area still no power
Got an email from Centerpoint about 2 hrs ago saying crews are in the area for my address. I was sleeping so just saw this. 77040 around Hollister St on the East side of 290. I'll go drive around and see if that's hogwash like it probably is. Though I am hopeful since we were one of the last to get power in May.
"After 30 hours, my part of 77083 has power"
Got power back just now - West U.
77008. Drove by the house and around Yale/Heights. No power N of 11th E of Yale. Didnt see any crews but given the wide area out they might be working at the source. On the plus side didnt see much evidence of widespread damage to poles and lines.
"77045 still no power in the residential areas, but there is power on parts of West Orem and West Fuqua. I saw a few gas stations up and running. 

Saw one Centerpoint truck during my tour of the neighborhood. It didn't appear to be doing anything. I guess they were still assessing damage and/or waiting for instructions."
"temp check, what're y'alls thermostats reading at? I'm at 80 downstairs, 82 upstairs with 75% humidity. My swamp cooler has run out of ice. Rip"
Power is back on 77006!!! Milam St and Lousiana St
77054 - Holly Hall Street power out still
I feel like if you are on the same grid as businesses you will get power today..if not good luck.
77077 - still no power since 10am yesterday
"77494 (right on the border of 77450 off westheimer)  — POWER BACK after 36 hours! House up to 85 degrees and hoping the power remains on. 

I had neighbors across the street that had their power restored 24 hours ago, so it’s been hell watching them love totally normal, non-inconvenienced lives the past day."
77070 still without power. Waaaay too hot for this
77007. Anyone near Jackson hill and Feagan? Do you guys have power? Update me if you guys get it!
"77043 west of Gessner near Spring Woods High school, no power. 
Office manager at my work just texted me power is on at work: 77092 near Mitchelldale and 43rd

Memorial City Mall is open and SLAMMED. Food
 court open but Starbucks closed .  I went to get a car charger for my phone and some food, people were charging their devices from the floor outlets.
Traffic lights are out at Gessner and I 10 and it is an accident waiting to happen. Take Bunker Hill exit the lights are working there then turn on Gaylord or Barryknoll to get to the mall.
There is a tree down blocking 1 lane on Longpoint heading east from Gessner toward Bunker hill, but the other eastbound lane is clear to get past it and the west lanes are ok. 
Valero Station on Gessner and Hammerly is open, I think the Kroger is open but not 100% on that."
"Lots of posts about 77096 back up, but I still don't have power :("
77069 is now at 36 hours without power.
"About two hours ago, I got an alert from Centerpoint saying that ""Repair crews are assessing the power issue at or near [MY EXACT ADDRESS].""

Has anyone else gotten that email and subsequently gotten their power restored?"
"My entire neighborhood has power except for 12 houses on one block.  Guess where I live? 

Why has thou forsaken me?"
"Westheimer and Fondren 

77063 

Still no power since 7am Monday."
"77518. Still no power. 

Keep getting notifications every hour or so from Centerpoint that the power to my house has been restored. Leave work, drive to house, reset circuit breaker: no power. Re-report outage.

So freaking tired of this shit."
Any update 77070?
"77008 E 26th and Harvard just got a notification from centerpoint that power is back but I’m out of town, can anyone near there confirm?"
[deleted]
"I am looking to change my apartment next month. Someone, please let me know where they fixed the electricity on the first day :p"
"77035 Central Westbury. I’ve already resigned myself to not having power until next Monday, I think we will be very lucky to get it back by the end of this week. "
77018 near N Sheperd and Pinemont still no power
"77006 near Rudyards - POWER BACK, internet (x-finity) working"
"Updates seemed to have dried up, giving up hope of getting power tonight... 77011 by Lockwood and navigation"
"Still no power for 77088, off 249 neighborhood is completely dark for 3rd night"
"77092 everyone near us seems to have power, but my appartment doesn't. The street lights are on right up until my appartment complex then turn back on again after us"
"77469 Richmond-Rosenberg, Our 3rd night without power. Fuck CenterPoint HQ, and the PUC/ERCOT"
77096: Power is back as of about 20 minutes ago. W. Belfort and Willowbend. My mom is across Chimney Rock near Belfort and still is out.
"Hey, /u/eepy_neebies_seepies  THANKS for your post!

You should add a note near the top that CenterPoint's outage map now shows estimated restoral, but you have to zoom in on your area and then left-click your mouse to have the estimate show up.

When I click on my area it doesn't give an estimate, but a mile north of us where my office is, it says by the end of the day July 13th.

Edit/Update:  Got a text and an email from CenterPoint at 1:35 PM today (Thursday) saying estimated restoral for us is by end-of-day Saturday 7/13, but could be sooner.  

Well, I hope it's sooner.  Propane is about $85 a day."
77070 lakewood FINALLY has power back. Wishing the best for those of you still left behind
77096: power now back around Chimney Rock and W. Belfort!!!
"77090 the map says end of day July 13, but my particular address has the note of “continue to provide restoration estimations as they become available.”  Quickly losing the little hope I had building today with that. Still not messages from them. "
"77088 - Inwood North, entire subdivision has power except my side of the street and the houses behind us. Then to add insult to injury, centerpoint sends me an email saying power had been restored to my home. Absolutely absurd."
"77571 - Still no power, but I did have my first cup of coffee since Sunday. Which turned into me drinking the whole pot fuck you caffeine withdrawal headaches."
77030 with no power. Told from apartment complex to not expect power for multiple more days.
"Another contribution to “the map is wrong” —

Checked the map just now and still has my address as blue/assessment complete. I have had power since Tuesday afternoon… my neighbors who have had power since Monday afternoon also are showing as blue. 

Also saw about 5-6 contracted centerpoint trucks posted up at the Target off Westheimer and 99 (Katy) this morning around 8:30AM."
"77077 - Briargreen Village - still no power for days. According to the new map, neighbors east of Briargreen drive are partially energized while my side remains in the blue. 


This is truly absurd. I remember losing power to Ike and winter storm Uri but those didn't last long; I never lost power to Harvey, Nicholas, or even the May derecho. Being in a hot, humid and dark house this many days is not fun whatsoever. 


I'm also sick and tired of the noises coming from the compressors my neighbors have been running 24/7. I can't even step outside for some fresh air or open my doors without getting slammed by their pollution. I'll be so happy when the power's back."
77063 I think I have officially lost hope. I really can’t believe a category 1 shut the city down for this long. 
If you are looking for a hotel room I managed to book one in college station that’s pet friendly. If anyone has updates about 77077 please let me know
77092 power is finally back but it's storming so I'm nervous (we're having momentary flickers) to get too excited 😭🙌🏽 I've felt hopeful seeing so many linemen in the area around the Clifton Middle School area since around 9am so I'm praying everyone in the area can get their power back asap!! 
"77571 - Walked down to verify second hand information about crews in the area. Confirmed 2 bucket trucks and guys actively working.

Centerpoint map shows only assessment done, not work. It seems the heroes on the ground maybe working faster than that busted map."
77064 jones and west. No power. Tired of this shit
77042 power is back!
77090 Cypress Station area is back as of about 10ish minutes ago
"77077 near Hwy 6 and Memorial. Came back on in the last few hours while a section 6 doors down never lost power. We were in the same “assessment complete” section as a bunch of lights on Hwy 6 so I was hoping for a quicker response, alas. And no updates from Centerpoint despite already being enrolled in their alerts prior to this storm. Off to shop for a guillotine for their executives, or maybe just a standby home generator. Gonna try to get quotes from several vendors and hopefully not get gouged too bad."
"Map is green, but still no power since Mon 5:45 AM."
"77074 next to Jane Long high, we still have no power, but the map shows the whole area as energized. We don't even have an update from CenterPoint, almost as if they don't give a fuck."
"77027, near Central Market. There has been no power since the storm hit. There is no estimated date for when they will repair the issues. At the very least, let us know how long it will take to get the power back on so we can prepare accordingly.  Centerpoint Energy is a disgrace of a company. I don't expect them to take any blame (though they should), but they need to communicate!!!"
"77025 : finally after 122 hours, we have the power."
77090 .. Finally electricity is back ..
Just checked the map after we got off the phone with center point. My area won't have power again until the 17th and judging by how accurate the map is so far that's if we are lucky. This is just ridiculous I have things due that have already been pushed back.
[deleted]
"77028… showing no eta on the map and everywhere around the neighborhood where rosewood park is has power. Who decided I’m last? Thank you for making me spend so much money and suffer for, according to their map, will be over 14 days? Come on…."
"77004, near Dennis and chenevert, no power still in this nested outage. Centerpoint map said would be fixed Friday, then yesterday, then today. Called them earlier and they said tomorrow. Idk how much longer this is really gonna go"
77007 w 6th got power!
77024 We got ours today!!! so happy!! pray of those that do not have theirs!
"I almost forgot to give an update, my apartment complex on Ella 77090 has power back on finally"
77004 power just came back. Hopefully stays on.
Why have two pinned threads for this?
"Can we not just have 1 megathread for power updates? Whatever the purpose of the other thread is, it all just devolves into power updates lmao"
"I've come to terms that for at least ~50% of us, we're in this for the long haul. The uncertainty in the forecast track and intensity lulled Centerpoint into complacency to not have staged out of state teams. It's going to be a week or more to restore power for that other 50% of us. 

Anyone who works in a hospital or government is saying the same thing about their contingency operations. Nobody wants to interrupt business until it's too late, or be called a fear monger for raising the alarm over a little tropical storm in the Gulf that, for awhile, seemed like it was tracking well south of us."
"77090 and 77073, still no power, just got a lovely text from centerpoint stating:


Blahblahblah we are working hard
Blahblahblah we care
Blahblahblah we are the champions
Oh, and prepare to be without power for days. 
Cheers"
"Got power about an hour ago on Lawrence between 8th and 11th Street in the Heights.  I have to say that given we went through a hurricane, getting power back after only one hot night is not too bad."
"I feel that it is ridiculous how Centerpoint hasn't improved with how they deal with this kind of crisis. 
I know me personally. This is at least the 3rd time I've experienced this exact situation. 
Rita, Ike, now Beryl. 
I'm pretty sure there's another hurricane I'm forgetting the name of where power was out for at least 2 days. 
The freeze we lost power for 3, maybe 4 days. 

What I'm saying is after 2 situations like this I would think Centerpoint could have learned from those 2 incidents and improved the way to handle it. Leaving the system they are taking responsibility for down for so long is not acceptable in my opinion.
If they are taking responsibility for this whole state why wouldn't they stay prepared and equipped to have it repaired after its taken down without the people who pay to use it having to go without for more than a day. 

If this is just impossible due to the way the system or grid is designed, then we need to design a better grid system period.

As a society, we like to think that we are more advanced than we where 10 years back. We aren't if this happened 10 years ago, and we are in that same predicament again. 

As a country, we send billions to other countries so they can do whatever it is they do with it.
 Why can't we use it to design a grid system that can be replaced within a day if the whole thing is taken out?
 If that's beyond the capability of out tech then it's time we take the smartest people we have in that area of study and find a design that doesn't ever let a category 1 hurricane cripple us like this again."
"77090 has a lot of people in sick, elderly in DIRE need.  No traffic lights. Shame on you, Centerpoint!"
Have they done anything at all? This is so fucking ridiculous. It is way too hot for them to be playing around and not giving us updates by location so we can plan.
[deleted]
I just want to say I truly feel bad for all yall still without power. this is insane
"Centerpoint isn’t giving any particular neighborhood by neighborhood updates but they’ve restored about 200,000 customers of 2.5 million at last check. Neighborhoods to the south are seemingly being restored the quickest given the storm impacted and moved out of those areas earlier in the day for their crews to get started."
"My parents and I both live in 77096, in the same apartment complex. They have power and I don't."
"The transmission-line insider guy added another update to his comment, tonight: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/lcik1fn/

> UPDATE3: 2140 on 7/10:

> * lines from Addicks to WP/BW8 to Bellaire returned to service

> * major breaker in south Pasadena returned to service

> * the crosstown work may have hit snags with the middle section that traverses the Heights still scheduled for outage ending 7/10 2200 so that work is likely to be moved to tomorrow. This includes a major xfmr at 610/290 that is scheduled to come back 7/13 1700

>Points to remember:

> * major lines feed the smaller lines. This is all information about major lines, not the lines that go to your house or even feed your neighborhood. These are big big lines that are the backbone of the system.

> * lines going out of service is normal, particularly when things need to be de-energized to fix them. Most of the time de-energizations happen and you never even know it because other lines handle the change but right now it's very possible to gain power and then lose it again. I know that it incredibly frustrating, but it's really the only way.

> * most work is likely moving to the distribution network where visibility drops. Currently it looks like they plan to wrap up major work by end of Saturday although that may easily move.

> * likely outages will be updated and new plans come out overnight from the work this evening."
Let’s go riot. I see no other option.
I lost power in 77034 and nothing yet.  Some down power lines
77044 just turned back on.

"77477 , still no power, though some buildings in my complex did get power back."
77477 whole neighborhood is pitch black. Except for all the neighbors chilling in their cars on driveways just to charge their phones lol (myself included)
"77016 Scenic Woods. Lost power 9:15am. Not a flicker since. Took a drive through the area around sunset. The Mi Tienda on 59 and Little York was open and packed. Everything else, except for a packed Valero on Little York was closed. Fiesta looked like they had power, and so did Home Depot (I know they have generators), but they were both closed. Only other stuff I saw with any real power was some light industry that surely has their own generators."
"77063 Tanglewilde/Ella Lee ln no power still. Neighbors on Guessner, Briar Forest dr and Westerland Dr got power. Centre point website says our meter is powered and online, not sure if they know that it's really NOT bc they don't accept electricity related calls today 😞"
77546 lost power at 5:00 a.m. four houses away from me got their power back at 5:00 p.m. not me though.
"Pessimistic news for those in 77024. Don’t expect power till at best tomorrow. According to email from piney point mayor, centerpoint has just assessed the damage today and work will begin tomorrow."
"77057, 77494, and 77035 all out since this morning and still nothing."
77023. No power since 8/9am.
Is there a way to sign up for center point energy text updates without using the website ? I can’t get the page to load
77034.  No power.   If this post goes through than cell towers might be working.
77011 just woke up after 'sleeping' partial power no water
77573 not necessarily in Houston I’m in league city but TNMP outage map says they are re evaluating for about 12+ hours and Main Street has power we are a block away and we don’t what gives
77406 (Pecan Grove) - No power still been out since Monday at 5:30 am.
I live right off I10 and gessnar. Every Business around me has power but my complex. Even after the last storm they lost it. This one nope just my complex. This is bullshit
"77019, 4th ward. Townhouses across the street from mine never lost power. Apartment complex I can see from my home (on grey) has power, I can see tvs. But nothing for the block I'm on apparently.


Gonna have to go somewhere with the animals today, can't stay when it's gonna hit the 90s. :-( even my parents out in bfe are without. "
77571 - just got power back. Had been off since ~6 am yesterday. Still no internet (Xfinity)
77054 still no power
Has anyone else got pussy footed? It’s happened twice so far the lights turned on then instantly turned off. Wtf does that mean? Both times happened 12 hours between eachother and the most recent one was 5 hours ago.
"77006 (near Montrose) power now on - thanks to the power crew working overtime

There are many trees down in area despite storm being ""only a Cat 1"". It's going to be a process to get them cleared from utility right of ways"
77004 museum district - Got power back at about 1030am. Across the street had power last night.
77076 still no power
"77536, lots of places with power now.

I have the dubious joy of having had the pole transformer blow about 30 minutes before the neighborhood, so many streets now have power - - except 4 of us.

I suspect that I'm gonna be waiting a few days."
"We’re out. And been out since Monday morning at 3AM. 77354 here and no where in sight has power. I drive to Conroe every day for work and even there they’re out of power. I got a child, dementia grandfather and wife at home with no food or running water"
77009 by north main. Power back on.
"Is anybody receiving power alerts from CenterPoint? I normally get them, but this time I am getting nothing. Half of our apartment complex has power, but my half doesn't. When I log in it says ""Status: Power Off"", but I've not received any emails or texts acknowledging our outage, despite being signed up for alerts."
Any update on 77070 (249/cypresswood dr area)? Haven’t seen any centerpoint trucks.
"My Mom in 77065 has power, but my brother in 77064 does not. I'm in 77069 still without power."
77019 power up 45 and Dallas
"Does this message from CenterPoint mean anything?

Repair crews are assessing the power issue at or near 77005. We will update you with additional information about the status of these repairs as it becomes available. We appreciate your patience as we work to complete our repairs as quickly and safely as possible."
"77004, around Binz and Calumet - Power came back around 5:30PM. Hopefully it keeps, I was starting to get a little loopy."
Anyone in 77070? I live close to Spring Cypress/249.
Just saw some linesman in EaDo at McKinney/Sampson

First year Houstonian….that fuckin sucked"
Any update as of 77070?

"77095 Southcreek still no power, out since 4 AM Monday.  Down the street they have lights but I'm part of a big long stretch that doesn't. I hope, hope, hope we are on the list for today. 🤞🤞🤞"
"I’ve posted a few times about my area here (77004, Venue Museum District apartments at Fannin and Oakdale). But we got power back around 10:30 pm last night, and the map still showed our address in orange as of this morning. My Centerpoint account DID update, however, to show that my meter was on once it was restored."
77530 just got power back
77095 Copper Lakes power just came back!!!
"77054, no power since Monday am. Every single other house in my neighborhood has power. Can someone explain how this is possible? Is my house somehow the only one connected to a different power line?"
77045 neighbors across the street got their power back. We never lost our power (we did last time) and the ATT internets still out

"Anyone know the status of 77008, near TC Jester and 11th? It sounds like power around the area is starting to come back. Currently working at a friend's house in Rosenberg and have not had a chance to go out to check."
77006 by comm and Vermont back in biz

Update: the power came back on"
"77007 - neighborhood near Jackson Hill & Washington still no power, but it looks like everyone around us has power 🫠"
"77066 - Thursday 7:17 AM - No power at our house, nearby businesses and traffic lights.  

I did see three utility bucket trucks northbound on Hollister heading toward 1960, and those were the first I've seen in this area.  Have to see that as a good sign."
77373 still nothing. Still haven’t seen a truck. No poles/lines down or trees down in the general area. My new hobby is sitting in the gas station parking lot and watching people not understand how to do a 4 way stop.
They meant noon Pacific Team obviously
"Frustrated with the lack of info for my area (and in general). If we don’t have an estimated restoration date yet, is it safe to assume we won’t have power by the end of the weekend?

Info would be helpful in figuring out next steps, but when has centerpoint done anything helpful?"
Still no estimate for the Gessner and Kemp Forest area... or much of Spring Branch at all.
"77096, the neighborhood behind Parker elementary has power (Willowbend and Atwell). Centerpoint is still reporting my power as off but a a neighbor said it was off and on for an hour, but now staying on. Will be driving over in a few to confirm if I can go home 🤞🏾🙏🏾"
77498 west Bellfort and hw6 is back

Waste management and disposal service skipped twice this week. Garbage bags are accumulating on the sidewalk. The situation is getting worse.
I would love to here more news about 77077. Ran from our apartment to a family friend that has power but you can only stay so long without feeling like intruding. My mom is at the end of her rope at the thought of this outage lasting any longer.

The entire fucking map of 77006 just inverted from blue to light green and vice-versa. Wtf is this?
"77459 Mo City. Cartwright west of Meadowcreek is still dark all the way past the 1092 intersection. Meadowcreek and eastward towards the texas parkway seems to have power.

The Chevron at Cartwright and Quail Valley East Drive is open and has gas if anyone in the area is still looking.

Stay safe yall."

[deleted]
"My section of 77066 went from end of day July 13 to end of day July 14 and I'm so tired, and scared of it just being continously pushed back."
"Still no power In my block. 77029 One side of the neighbors have power and the other side (includes me) none. Last time I check it was blue, then back to green which means energized. Ugh not even an estimate day on restoration.

 Update: my power came back. I”ll pray to all father that power gets back to all other parts of Houston today as well. "
77090 power back on finally 😩
"77004, midtown, Dennis and chenevert, still no power. According to the dumb map we should’ve had it fixed EOD yesterday but it seems like there’s still nested outages. No ETA as of right now"
"new map. july 16 for me. 


at least there’s a date now."
"77034 - Gulf Palms - Power back up at around 14:50 local time (2pm, almost 3pm)

I know many brothers and sisters in this thread and the other main daily are still out, but thankfully this time. I am done for now."
Why it’s about to storm..AGAIN?!?!

"77057 Woodway and Voss we are BACK ONLINE! I could not be more relieved, finally!!"
77040 off west gulf bank road has power! 🎉🙏🏾
"77023 no power. I think that the last folks to get their power restored should have a block party style celebration with news coverage, a marching band and prizes from local businesses. lol."
"77066 - Monday 7/15 - Still out, and the map says by end of day Wednesday, still.

I think a big part of the problem, right in the middle of the purple section on our map, is [this pole that's down](https://i.imgur.com/Nj67JQP.jpg) near the Tim Horton's at Richie and Bammel N. Houston.

I have to go to work today and leave the house on generator power, but sure hope someone sees them starting to do some work on this pole today.  It's not a simple one because there are underground conduit runs involved, but it'll obviously have to be fixed before a lot of us get power back."
77373 Cypresswood near Kroger. Monday day 8 out of power.
"77066 - Champions Village II - Power restored just before 3:30 this afternoon (Monday).

Delighted to be able to shut off that generator and give it a rest."
77055 - Hammerly and Johanna just got power back!
"77008 N of 24th - POWER BACK ON 2:50 PM

Spoke to the linemen - when they tried to re-energize the circuit yesterday, the inrush amperage from everyone's AC kicking on at the same time melted one of the power lines into another, causing a short and blowing a big fuse (the grenade we heard over here).

They replaced the lines and the fuse, and we should be stable!"
"77004 Museum District just LOST power again.
Edit: Update, power is back. They had to turn it off in order to repair a local power line apparently."
"77095, still no power in my area. Sleeping downstairs on the couch, but my 80lb dog decided it’s a good idea to sleep on my legs tonight 🙃"
"So um about that tracker...
Is it in the room with us along with the power?"
"I hope as long as its taking they truly are FIXING the problem, not putting tape over it."
"Still no power in my Alief neighborhood. Two million people without power, is that some kind of record? And for this weak ass storm?


 For the first time, a couple of my neighbors seem to have acquired generators. While I'm proud of them for staying on top of things, I didn't realize how incredibly loud they are. Can't imagine what it will sound like after everyone gets one we will inevitably need to do."
77004. Got power back at 1 pm.
"77025 power is back for me. I can take in anyone’s dog or small animal tomorrow who needs it (I have pet rats so I can’t take any cats, I’m sorry).

Thank you, linemen. CenterPoint and Texas reps: eat shit!"
Centerpoint just sent a text saying they are working on clearing debris and vegetation to make repairs. They are saying to be prepared to not have power for several days. Thing is...there is no damaged lines or debris/vegetation around 77040 for miles!
"77498 still no power, I’m pregnant and this heat is…not comfortable. 

Our neighborhood has been on “Assessment in progress” on Centerpoint’s bullshit map since it was released. Just now my husband and I spotted a lineman truck in our neighborhood, so we chased it down and asked if they were fixing things in our neighborhood. Nope - they were just now doing the initial patrol of our area to spot/identify issues. Then they’d have to go report back to their superiors, who presumably would take the info and put us in line for some assistance sometime in the future. The linemen in the truck had no idea when they or anyone would be sent out to actually do any repairs. 

The best part is I checked the status map right after that conversation and the fucking liars at Centerpoint (not blaming the linemen at all) had updated our area to “assessment complete.” They barely STARTED this morning and said the patrol of their assigned area might take a day or two. Centerpoint is absolutely cooking the books to make it seem like they have done way more than they have and repairs are progressing much faster than they actually are. 

This shit makes me so angry and there’s nothing, absolutely nothing we can do about it as long as our corrupt and complicit state government (who I already vote against in every election) co-signs this abysmal treatment of their citizens."
77007 Jackson Hill & Feagan has power!!
77091-(Pinemont Plaza-near Tidwell and TCJ) power restored. It was off from 5am Monday to 5pm Friday. Thank you Linemen and fuck you Centerpoint!

[deleted]
77025. Out since 5 am still.
77007 next to St Thomas High School and still no power.  It took 3 days to get power to this area during the derecho.  I feel like the damage from the hurricane was not as extensive so hoping we get it back sooner.
"We have a downed line. I'm trying to call an EMERGENCY, but I can't get through!!!"
"77062, no power still, my poor pets started overheating so we sat in my car for ac :("
"SOS I’m new to generators — how do I safely power down my generator? I know unplug everything but should I kill the gas switch first and let it shut down or flip the off switch? 

I have the 3500w craftman from Lowe’s."
77007 near Cleveland Park still no power.
Still no power or water in 77027 since early this morning 😵‍💫

"77098 no power. See generators along the sidewalk, not sure but maybe that is what is powering a couple nearby complexes I see with lights on. Also lights on at Lamar high school pkg garage."

77586 is still pretty fucked.
"77030, just north of Holcombe, power just came back on."

77011 off wayside n canal  just turned back on!!!
Does anyone in 77008 have power?  Don’t even see crews out
Has anyone gotten power back and then lost it again? Trying to figure out how stable this state of restoration is!
77006 back on
My center point account just changed from power off to power on but I clearly don’t have power — what does that mean? Working its way?

Power restored for 77004. Commented previously—located near MacGregor/TSU/St. Mary’s Catholic Church.
"77494 just came back online as did 77035 and 77057 earlier.  All partial obviously. 

Also, if you haven't got a poweralert notification about your house yet, don't be discouraged. I only got prior notice they were working on one of them. The other two just came on without notice."
77095 power on. Thank you Jesus
77007 between Shepherd and TC Jester just got power back! Was about to head to my wife's office and it blessedly returned.
77459 still nothing :((
Center point told someone in our complex to expect several days... At 77021
77072 the entire shopping center where the HEB is at Beltway 8 and Beechnut is has power. The Whataburger drive thru only is open. The Boba and Wok Express are open. But still no power past that on Beechnut to (?) although I believe someone said there is power further down around Kirkwood or Dairy Ashford iirc
"77098 Montrose - power came back on around 4 or 5 PM I think. 

I was staying with a friend in Katy and made the mistake of waiting to get gas. Don't wait. I had to go to four gas stations to get gas and my empty light was on. One station ran out right as I pulled up to the pump. I finally got gas at the Kroger on Voss.

Edit: some hotels are still available in Katy and my coworkers were able to get hotel rooms near the galleria"
77008 Beverly and 13th whole neighborhood is out 😔 
"There's a pole down at Bammel North Houston and Richey that's been down since Monday evening, I haven't seen one truck around it."
77373 still no power…this is ridiculous
"
No power yet 77077 near 6 and Westheimer

Update 7p still nope

Update Thurs just after midnight still nope"
Does anyone know a timeline of the different steps centerpoint takes? As in when they will start on the neighborhood level outages and so on
Just came back to power in my apartment building again 😭 they also removed the fallen tree in the front  (77019 - across from Piggy’s bar) hope that means other buildings on my block also got power back! 
"Just stopped by 77096 about 30 minutes ago. Didn’t see any homes with visible lights driving down Hillcroft from US 90. The whole neighborhood between Willowbend/Hillcroft and W Bellfort/Chimney Rock seemed to be out. While leaving, I saw some traffic lights that were dead last night back on again, on/near Chimney Rock and US 90. Don’t know if that means anything."
"77584 had power for a few flickers then cut out again. Email from Centerpoint saying the issue is resolved and thanks for being a customer lol. No power to anything on my block, went ahead and rereported it I guess."
"77070 - NW cypresswood area, fm1960- finally got power here, we saw many trucks now going down 1960, good luck neighbors"
77015 Email from Centerpoint just now saying they are working on getting me an estimate of which date my power will be restored

"> work on a major crosstown 138kV line through the Heights to Crosby is going out this evening (1630) and expected back at 2200. This is likely to go out or may already be out, hopefully come back later tonight.

This is from the Ercot guy from earlier. I live between the Heights and Crosby in the Sheldon area, could someone smarter than me tell me what this means for power between the two places? My power never came back aside from a brief 5 minute period yesterday, could this possibly mean that we'll get ours back tonight?"
[deleted]
Anyone know about what's going on in magnolia (77354)? Still no power since 5am Monday but there's a bunch of Centerpoint trucks out here off of Egypt. Trying to see if we should have any hope lol

Oh and bummer.. my xfinity router appears to have been fried. Anyone else have that happen?? It won't power on at all. "
[deleted]
"Does it show ""Power is on"" under yalls Centerpoint account as soon as the power is back at your house?"
77019 - La Rue street near W. Dallas & Waugh. Still no power. We have been a highlighted blue section of the map for the past 24 hours or so but still nothing. a neighbor told me we won’t get restored until SUNDAY?! Not sure how well informed they are. I pray they are wrong as hell tho 
77057 near San Felipe/Fountain View power just came back on 😭
"77571 - No power, but the antique bike path lights have power so that's good. Bicycle safety is no joke."
"[https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/about-us/news/1779](https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/about-us/news/1779)

  
Does anyone have access to the most recent update from the centerpoint site where they report the number of outages/restored? When I went to open the one they released at 8am today, it keeps opening to a blank page...."
77069- left two hours ago and there was still no power for those wondering.
77494 Seven Meadows section 19 (northeast of Fry/Katy-Gaston) got power back at 1 a.m. Xfinity appears to be working as well. Im not sure if the whole neighborhood is back up though.

Power still out 77096. Any update?
"CNP map now has dates - for my neighborhood in 77345 (Kingwood), I have “end of day, July 12”. Yay, tomorrow! Could be BS but I’m hopeful!"
How are you guys checking estimates? Any updates on 77459 Missouri City?
77063 showing green on the map as of late but unfortunately we don’t have power here. I’m sure this nasty storm will cause delay. I bet CenterPoint didn’t know a storm was coming today 😅🙄😩
"I guess this storm is gonna cause some further delays, understandably. 
Saw that there is no ETA for my area, at this rate I hope it’s before Sunday"
77450- AT&T internet back on as of 2PM
"77571 - Letter from mayor says power by weekend longshot most likely mid week.

The truck stop and all the businesses across the highway from me are powered."
Does anyone have an update on 77373? North Spring?
"77379 - 99 and champion forest drive area… power appears to be back up.

Not at location, but all my devices just popped up online and got notifications on my phone."

77044 bw8/tidwell We just got power back on

77407 got power back 24 hours ago. Lost it again just now.
[deleted]

"Stopped by my dad's house in 77088, near Antoine and Gulf Bank. He got power as soon as we got there. Around 5:30PM ish"
[deleted]
"77064 - Between 1960 and Beltway 8. Brother’s House got power back at 7. Power briefly went back out, but has remained on since 8 pm."
[deleted]
"Still in our non-electrified bubble in 77006. Tried calling Centerpoint and they are at least aware of the outage. No estimate of course. 

I was in New Orleans as a teenager when Katrina hit. I never thought I’d have to relive a mini version of that in Houston and from a Cat 1."
Has anyone in the partially energized zone gotten an ETA? I only see blue areas with ETAs and I’m wondering if they’ll do us last.
[deleted]
77098- actually losing hope
"77379 - Got back power yesterday around 5PM, lost power around 11:30 am until 12:30 pm today - now have power + internet. Considering my blessings."

Saw 3 CP trucks on San Jacinto and Cleburne
77077 - briar forest & Kirkwood - got power back about an hour ago
"77571 - Bucket trucks all took off at 6pm. Another night tending the generator. But that's ok, I am grateful for having it."
77007 mid-Jackson Hill. Power is back up as of a few hours ago!
Do they actually work overnight as well? Anybody got power back in the middle of the night? The new map is absolute trash. Marked as energized when the whole neighborhood is still without power.
"77090 says i should have had power yesterday.. still no power in my apts or any businesses or lights on my street for that matter, stop fwm centerpoint just be honest about when my shits coming back on i have roaches trying to move in its so muggy in my apt."
77008 near TC Jester. Still no power but I saw a ton of bucket trucks out by Eureka rail yard this morning. So maybe there’s hope
77571- We back baby! Fingers crossed it stays that way!
My generator just went out for good like 30 minutes ago. I am screwed at this point. No sign of trucks anywhere.
"77388 FM 2920/Bridgestone Ln

Power came on for 2 seconds and hasn't come back since."
[deleted]
"77379, Spring Cypress/Champions forest, we just got power back. Out since Monday morning, even though we’ve been listed as energized since two days ago."
"77006, Fairview & Waugh. Finally got an estimate for restoration. EOD next Tuesday. 

I’m fucking floored it’s taking this long. But at least we got news?"
77008 near 11th and TC Jester - power is back

Finally after long days our power is up! Mist ln apartment 77070 😊 thank you lord! 🙏
finally. 77489 is back. bless you all who are still putting up with centerpointless’ bullshit. hoping you all get it soon
77380 no power but restoration map says today. Have 0 faith in that tho
"The map said my area by 288/dennis/McGowen was suppose to be fixed Friday, then yesterday, and today there is still no power. 

I really want this shit to end"
"77066 - Champions Point Village - Hollister/Bourgeois - Day 7 without power.  Also, Xfinity cable has been out the whole time too.

Logging into their website and phone app, it shows weather-related outage, but it sure seems like they should be up by now."
"77066 - W. Richey/Bammel N. Houston - Sunday 7/14 1:40 PM - [Here's part of the problem.](https://i.imgur.com/Nj67JQP.jpg)

Pole down since the storm, looks relatively straightforward.  No trees, very accessible.  

Feeds buried lines, probably for several subdivisions and intersections.  Lights still out at that intersection and most nearby."
Two of my relatives in 77088 have power now
77007 near Yale and 6th got power at about 2:20pm today. Centerpoint account still incorrectly says power is off.
"77386, Spring - Back of Imperial Oaks (a bunch of streets called “Estates”). Power Restored as of 5 minutes ago. Giving it a bit to see if it’ll go off again, but we’re very happy!"
My internet was somehow restored before my power 😅
Still no power in Kingwood
"Power was projected to be back on for my area on 16Jul2024, however, power was restored last evening on 14Jul2024. Centerpoint’s power outage map still shows my area as pending to have power restored by 16Jul2024. The power outage map cannot be relied on completely. 

To all those that remain without power, my thoughts are with you, and hopefully you are restored soon and before your projected restoration date"
77086 - 249 & Beltway 8 Power restored at 11:30.

"seems like we have a bad transformer,  just my godamn luck.  it only feeds a couple of houses so how fucked are my neighbors and I?"

Entergy Texas Hurricane Beryl Alert

Tuesday, July 16, 2024 – 9:30 a.m.

TEXAS

Nearly all customers restored after Hurricane Beryl caused widespread outages across Southeast Texas 

As of 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, approximately 248,000 of the 252,460 customers have been restored. The remaining customers who can safely take power are expected to be restored today.

Customers still experiencing an outage are encouraged to safely check for damage to the electrical equipment attached to their home or business. Entergy Texas cannot restore power to a location with a damaged meter base, conduit or weather head (the metal pipe extending upward from the structure with electrical cables inside). These items must be repaired by a qualified electrician before workers can start the restoration process. Entergy’s Storm Center provides a list of the electrical equipment the company will repair, and the equipment customers are responsible for repairing.  https://www.entergynewsroom.com/storm-center/weatherhead/

As crews continue to clear debris and restore power in hard-hit areas, customers are encouraged to visit Entergy’s View Outage map or sign up for outage alerts to receive real-time restoration updates. Entergy Texas will continue working around the clock until every customer impacted by Hurricane Beryl is restored."
1:30p Power back on in 77092 - Watonga and 43rd. 15 days out this year.
My mom in Humble 77396 just had electricity turn on minutes ago! Happened just a few hours after internet came back on.
I'm in 77057. Power out since Fri night. just turned back on. Fountain View.
"I mainly dislike the lies. I was given two different repair times. Then I was told it had been fixed. It had not. Confirmed with neighbors. I had to call it in again. Now they admit it hasn't been fixed. Duh.

I can handle adversity, but don't piss on me and tell me that it's raining, Centerpoint!"
Does Centerpoint work overnight or are we cooked for another day? Fuck this is demoralizing.
77584 power back on as of 20 minutes ago!
"77007 tc jester east and I10, no power since about 8am, there are a few streets in the zipcode that got their power but nothing for us. "
"77090 and 77073 still no power. 
If their latest ""map"" is to be trusted it's all ""assessment"" and no actual repair work has even started. Still haven't seen a single linesman or repair crew or even truck. 


At this point I'm treating everything Centerpoint says as lies, incompetence and PR BS. Very very angry, I hope they get what's due for being unprepared and ignoring issues.


State, City, county officials are all now playing the blaming game. Beyond pathetic. 
Nice start to a mayor's term /s"
"So the new map says that my entire area is totally energized, yet I'm looking out on a totally dark neighborhood. It's scheduled to be done by the end of today, so I think what they're doing is just putting anything that's scheduled to be done today as already done to pump their numbers up and make it look better."
"77066 (Klein) 11:00pm


Most of the surrounding area is lit back up, but there is an island of darkness around Bammel N Houston and Richey. I am in that darkness. It's like repair crews came and repaired everything else but my complex and the small subdivision behind it. Still have yet to see any trucks even look at the fallen utility pole at the corner of the intersection. They even got much of Greenwood Forest back online and there were trees down left and right in that area! Makes no sense. 


Other than that cell service is working as it should. 


More stores are open on 1960 and Veterans Memorial so don't have to go far and relives congestion when going out for supplies. 


Hang in there. CPs bullshit map keeps pushing the estimated date of restoration further and further back, currently says power to be restored Wednesday (17th)"
77095 just got power back!

"77023, still no power since Monday at 8am. I want to cry."

77088 still has no power
77089 Dixie farm and Blackhawk… still no power received a text at midnight that they would have a better timeline by “tomorrow” great way to create confusion because did they mean “today” or actually “tomorrow”. At the 71 hour mark without power.
"Nothing still in 77088, fans can only do so much. Felt nauseous for a bit, I'm just tired of this"
"77014 Update: no updates, still no power :))))"
77459 in Olympia Estates - so frustrating to see the row of houses literally across from me (even the house that’s unoccupied and on the market) that have power but my house and the row I’m on still with no power. How that even work?!

"77008, Sunset Heights: No power. Was out 76 hours during the freeze and 136 hours after the derecho, so I'm just assuming our neighborhood will be one of the last again."
77429 Huffmeister & Telge. Just got power back although some people in my small area don’t have it. Map says we wouldn’t get it back til the 12th.
Has anyone that has been in the light green gotten power? We are one of a few houses in our neighborhood without power and wondering if there’s any chance we will get it back sooner rather than later
Power restoration on my street is garbage. Half of the other side of my street got power a day ago. The other half of the street got power at 1PM today. The whole row on my side still has no power. ALL of the center point trucks left the area. So I'm about to get gas to try and run my generator another night.....
Are there any updates for 77060? The map hasn’t updated for that area at all and all around us seems to have power. I feel so ignored :(
77077 Energy Corridor - My modem on AT&T Smart home manager app is showing my modem back online again but I’m 2 hours away from home. Anybody in this area got power back?
77401 near Evergreen and S Rice finally has power back.
My brother in 77064 just got power.
"77057 near Woodway and Voss- just got home from Kroger. All the traffic lights are working now and every single business I passed on Woodway heading home has power. Even saw some homes on my street with lights on! It’s like they skipped right over us🙃
Editing to add: in case it wasn’t obvious, still don’t have power haha"
77063 still down 🥲
77064 - power as of 7pm
77386 （near pinewood bend ln ）power restored few hours ago. But still see neighbours out.
No power yet 77030 Cambridge and Holcombe intersection. Map doesn’t indicate estimated time. So tired.
77502 some blocks have power some don't. Mine seems sandwiched between two that do so I don't really understand how this is working tbh
77018 villas near stomping grounds - still no power
"77089, Sagemeadow along Blackhawk. After getting power for like 30 seconds last night, nothing else happened. Now on the outage map, it says expected power by the end of today, and I saw multiple electric trucks in my neighborhood, including one working on lines at the end of my street. I'm praying it'll actually be fixed today"
"77072 no power since Monday and it is Friday. All hope is lost. Been sleeping in heat, no good food, barely able to charge my phone. I'm already tired."
77088- Day 5 no power still. The outage map showed our area green with power restored but that’s not true. No one has power except some businesses.
Just got power back yesterday (77096) and this rain and thunder has my anxiety so high.
"77004- transformer blew Tuesday night…still without power. Management won’t help us and we’ve reported to centerpoint at least 10 times now. 
What the fuck."
77003 Between Webster and McGowan and I finally have power!
77042 near westpark Dr and briar park. Just heard a loud noise that heartbreakingly sounded like a transformer exploding.
77042 Woodchase and Westpark now have power in my complex!!!
77373 by Hirschfield I just got home and my powers back on. 
"77004, midtown, 288/McGowen

No power still. The map shows that my part is connected to the portion across 288 and is light green. The other portion right next to me is blue. Idk what that means in reality but I hope this gets fixed by the end of the weekend. 

I think we’re gonna cave and go stay at a friend’s house for the weekend."
77586 - my little block is the last holdout east of 146 in Seabrook.  Line crew said they have a few more spots my way left to hit tonight.  Fingers crossed.  I got a hotel room today so I figured once I spent the money we would see progress.
"77070, just north of Louetta/249 intersection. Just got confirmation that our power is back from our apartment office. Hope more of you in the same area also have good news soon!"
"Just got power back in 77583, five minutes after I finished changing the oil in my generator."
"77388 FM 2920/Bridgestone

Out since Monday 6:28am. I give up on ever getting power back."
Anyone that dealt with this in the derecho- will nested power outages be addressed after all of the circuits are complete…. After the 19th?
"77379 still no power since Monday early morning , the lines are still down in front of my neighborhood and 0 work has been done."
77459 still no power
"77066 - Hollister south of Bourgeois - Champions Point Village II - 5:42 AM Saturday, no power.  The corner store at Hollister & Bourgeois has power, as do the traffic lights.  

Centerpoint texted last night around 8:45 saying our area's expected restoral time is by end of day Sunday.  

Driving around our neighborhood, no obvious major problems.  Poles & wires are up, no trees across lines, etc.

Must be a hidden issue somewhere.  

Since they also gave that same time frame for my office over off Theall Rd. near Cutten, and it came up Thursday evening, I guess we can see a fair chance they'll get us up today.

I'm glad I have a generator but I should have set up natural gas for it.  Propane is $84 a day and wrestling 100 lb. cylinders isn't a fun way to spend time in the heat."
77069 Champions Green Apartments - Still no power. Map shows no estimated date for restoration. Really losing hope here…
77006 Missouri St. small pocket of houses still without power but the map says we are energized. I’ve reported the outage online several times. Is it worth calling and trying to talk to someone? Has anyone with a “nested” outage in an energized area had any lucky with calling CP?
77379 Spring Cypress road intersecting stubiner power back on.
77586 - Seabrook.  Looks like the final trees and branches are being cleared between Repsdorph and El Lago.  Some branches were on the lines behind Regatta Bay and Bar Harbor.  Hopefully this is it.  Just got the workers some bourbon as a thank you.  Tree crew all the way from West Virginia.
"77388 FM 2920/Bridgestone Ln

Power's back!!!!!!!!!"
"Status website for people living in Bellaire.

[https://www.bellairetx.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=2653](https://www.bellairetx.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=2653)"
huge armada of 8+ trucks has set up camp behind me at the funeral home on heights and 13th. I have power but hopefully this turns more of yall on n of me
77027 near the central market. Just got word my power is back! The estimated date they said was July 17th. So that map is completely useless.
"It's still much less detail than Entergy has been providing, but Centerpoint has finally started posting limited updates for their specific services areas, here: https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/Safety/Pages/Storm-updates.aspx?sa=ho&au=res"
"We were supposed to get power today, but it’s still out. 77056"
"77057 Woodway and Voss- well I’m disappointed honestly. Map says we were supposed to get power today, and the eight trucks outside our complex this afternoon were suggesting that too. Me and my neighbors were super excited by all the activity. And then the trucks moved down the street to do some more work. But now I’m winding down for another night on my sofa with my fan :/"
"77571, still no power on the backside of Shoreacres. Happy to hear that our neighborhood has started to get power again. God bless "
77072 power finally came back 30 minutes ago
"I have reports of power back at 77006, Fairview! Trying to confirm in person."
77373: Spring without power
"Are there any updates on nested power outages? I'm in 77077; half the complex has power, and the other half does not. Map says energized, but we haven't had power since Monday morning."
"77006, trucks spotted down Nevada and Ridgewood. 🙏"
77007 Durham and Floyd. No power and no water. Nothing since Monday morning.
Finally getting some attention near N. Braeswood and Academy. Several Centerpoint bucket trucks. Am in a fairly large nested outage in 77025.  Hopefully they can fix it tonight!
77373 (louetta/lexington) is on! Has been for about 25 minutes. Absolutely wonderful!
"77024- Bunker Hill Village area just got power back!

Received an email today it would be end of day on the 17th."
77035 no power 
"77023, next to Mason Park. Tree from park is still downed over power lines. No linemen seen. They really do not give a fuck.

No power since 8am literally last Monday. No estimate from Centerpoint. Nothing."
"in 77036, we got power back the second night after the storm but it went out again this morning... 😭 did anyone have their power go out again and then restored...?"
"77018 
Just got power turned back on thank goodness it has been rough"
77055 Antoine and Westview - nested outage restored around 2:00pm today
"77004 Jackson and Anita, just got home and after 9 days we finally have power!"
"77066 - Power restored Monday just before 3:30 PM.  But yesterday evening at 6:19 PM the power went off but only stayed off for about 2 minutes.  

Having seen posts from people who got power back, restocked fridges, then had it go back out for hours, I was really glad when that A/C kicked back in.  

Hoping for stability as we move ahead.

I checked the restoral map this morning and was surprised at how many areas still do not have power.

Lots of suffering going on."
"77406, power went off at 5:30ish, not back yet."
77062 powers been out for about 24 hours now.
77095. Have not seen a single Centerpoint truck when I was driving. What are they doing?! This is insanity they are so disorganized. Playing with peoples lives in this heat. They had time to prepare!
[deleted]
77006 Milam and McGowen power back on!
"You late on the huge bills they send you  they would shut off fast ,  your power is out so what. After this storm they most likely lose a lot of costumers, for there lack keeping people informed about power outages   My power is been off going on 3 day nothing from tnmp"
"77040 no power when we left around 7:00 pm. Currently charging stuff at a friend’s in the energy corridor where things seem mostly ok. I am losing my mind, anyone else? :)))) i’m not sure how much more of this i want to go through y’all."
"On CenterPoint's [Outage Tracker](https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/?_ga=2.223443356.64566939.1720578371-221761639.1720444979) page, they posted a link: 

""**July 10, 2024 - 8:30 p.m.**  -    [CenterPoint Energy provides customer restoration update](https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/about-us/news/1778)"". 

When I click on it, as of the time of this comment, all I see is a white page with the words: 

""The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable."" 

At this point the material is writing itself."
"This storm looks gnarly, def gonna delay restoration even more smh"
"77035 - Willowbend

Just got power back 5 min ago!"
Power restored in 77386!
"Anyone know how many people are still without power? I let a friend borrow a window AC and generator for his 87 yr old grandma that lives off Bingle and 290, and now he's not returning my calls. Wondering if he just wants to keep it and I got scammed fml"
"Keep getting told I have power when I don’t have power. I’m 100% sure they are keeping our power off on purpose. I had power for an hour or so the other day and then they shut it off. Line guys saying they were told not to turn the power on our side because they didn’t want to “overload” the system. That has never been an issue in the 5 years I’ve been here, during any outage. What the fuck is going on?"
Has anybody without power actually had it restored? There are vast areas in my neighborhood that are just completely pitch black. I know CenterPoint claims that they restored a million people and they're going to restore a million more by Wednesday where there will still be another million left without power but somehow I don't believe them.
Zip codes don’t mean shit. My in laws have had power since yesterday afternoon meanwhile we haven’t since 6am yesterday…. We live down the street from each other in the same zip code.
77095 no power and now no water. Third world country.
77022. We lost power right at 5am and got it back a tad before 6pm
"Y'all got back fast!! I'm glad to hear that some of y'all have your power back already, hopefully it'll be back within a couple of days. My job is closed tomorrow but fingers crossed it's back before the end of Tuesday

i can't really respond to every single comment but i really appreciate the updates, especially the one pointing out that more southern areas are being repaired first. i didn't think about that at all

UPDATE: It is 8:45 PM and the apartment complex across from us just got their lights back. 77057"
"77004 power has been out since like 5 in the morning yesterday iirc (and funnily enough, I didn’t have power problems during Harvey at all)."
Protip: the “we are working in your area” message on Entergy’s outage tracker site is a lie designed to placate you. Text them “STAT” to see real outage information and to know if they have started restoration in your area yet.
"77388 has partial power.  The crews come and turn on power all down the main roads for the businesses and schools but they dont take the 5 minutes to open and reset the transformer right next to where they already are for the neighborhoods.    Instead they leave and come back 3 days later to spend the 5 minutes to turn it on.  
Centerpoint needs to be fired.  I dont want to use them anymore.  

They are wasting more travel time then they need to which will add up causing more delays for everyone to get their power back on.  They should be going down the line of transformers instead of zig zagging around spending more time driving then fixing anything."
"Does stating your zip code matter? Because not all 77054 is without power. Can someone tell me what map y’all referring to when you say the map shows green !!!!. Never mind…here is the link for some one equally clueless ( scroll down to see the map)
https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195bcf03ae0c491f9f14bf77f2c43420
So I am in orange that means Centerpoint hasn’t even checked us , green is Ofcourse good, blue means - repair in progress. So …. What does it mean? Does it mean that we will get power later. Sorry for entitled questions , I have had two hours of sleep and I need to crack this code. What are areas that are not colored."
"My mom got a message from centerpoint saying to expect to be out of power for several days, 77011. But we know people in our zip code have power is this a generic message."
"last couple times I've refreshed the site, the # of customers restored has been going *down*."
"If Centerpoint has reached their magical “million” resorted power, then why does it seem that the MORE people are still complaining that they HAVE NO FREAKING POWER?!"
"77077 energy corridor. Power came back at 1:45 today, then thunderstorms came in and the power went back out. It was only on for about 30 minutes 😔"
77021 got power lets gooooo 😎
"Finally have power back in part of our subdivision in 77406. Four trucks out dealing with a tree that fell and ripped down power lines. They still have to deal with a broken utility pole and told a neighbor that would not happen until tomorrow. 

My stepmother is in West U and her neighbor spent hours on hold to get through to a person at CenterPoint who told her that they thought the area all had power when they do not. They had not even had anyone assessing their area. I have been over the help her every day this week since Tuesday and have not seen any power crews in the area but lots of damage."

"77521, Baytown, power has been out since Monday afternoon. 

It seems like they almost got me hooked up yesterday, then I heard a transformer explode somewhere. There's a downed line one house away from me and I haven't seen any crew or anyone even come look at it yet. 

My HOA forwarded a notice from CenterPoint that they expect to have about 50% of people back on by Wednesday afternoon, but that's at least 24 hours too long."
What’s the situation like around 77056 Woodway and Post Oak?
"77030, been without power for a little over 24 hours"
77095 no power still. Long night
"77038, power back up"
"77049 North Shore area. We got power back at 12:37 am. I was not able to report immediately because phone had no charge. This ordeal is finally making me resolve to do all the proper prep.  
Edit to add: What the fuck! The power went out again a few minutes ago. I’m hoping this is just the need for a quick little extra fix to make us all set up for good.  

 4:05 edit: still no power although other very near places do have it. Such a halfass storm and the city is crippled, library not open, short on bus drivers so many buses not running, gas lines everywhere. Spotty electric restoration. This is ridiculous!"

"No power in Alief 77072 Beechnut and Beltway 8.  The HEB and Walmart on 8 have generators and we picked up ice and bread yesterday, but as you might guess, they're out of bananas, deli meats for the most part.  The Texas Boil House attached to that HEB has hot food and the food trucks do as well.

I just checked the Whataburger app and the Whataburger at Fondren and 59 in Sharpstown has power.  That's the closest in a few miles radius from here with power."
77059 in the Middlebrook area got power back about 30 minutes ago

[deleted]
77092 just came back up. Gonna wait to see if it stays before I start packing up my generator.

Got my power back around 10:30 pm. 77004.
"Still nothing in spring 77379 literally ripped lines since Monday in the middle of the entrance to the neighborhood, nothing has been done ."

"77019, near waugh/allen — the map still shows assessment, any hope to get power by Wednesday? :("

Can confirm no power yet at Swamp Plantation in Conroe
my area is not marked in the centerpoint power outage map with any color. does that mean my area will not get power anytime soon?
77062 near the Exploration Greens finally got power.
Any updates for eado/ second ward?
"does anyone know if CenterPoint is releasing phase powers? My office is up, but only the light stuff can turn on such as lights, small plugs. Not heavy duty items like AC or printers can turn on."
"Saw several trucks in the old Fudrucker's parking lot on Kirkwood at 59 in 77477, and a couple on 90 near BW8. About an hour later our old office's power came on. Our new office, also in 77477 and about a mile away from the old office, has no power but we're crossing our fingers."
77401 Bellaire behind the Wal-Mart on South Rice. Still no power. AT&T Cell tower is back on line tho as of last night.
"77584 west Pearland, received power back yesterday morning but now the power is out again once it started raining ugh"
"Had power since yesterday 9AM and it went out again about 15 minutes ago.   
Did receive a text from CenterPoint saying they've detected an interruption in service roundabout the same time.  
Also received a text from Xfinity about the same time that they have an outage.

Looking at other posts about losing power again, as well as xfinity and losing 5G service on my cellphone, all about the same time, makes me think that this is more widespread than something local to my area (which is next to Avalon Terrace in 77581)."
77002 midtown area still no power since 9am yesterday. We had power through the storm but then it suddenly turned off (maybe for repairs?) but it's been more than 24 hours now
77045 Buffalo Speedway and Airport. Power on as of 3:40 pm

"Has anyone successfully syphoned gasoline out of their newer model car? I have full tanks on my cars but cannot get it out of the tank. I know how to syphon but it just isnt working. 


1) i have filled the tube up. Plugged it and put it in the tank. Then release the outside end low to the ground. 


When i blow in the tube i get bubbles. I know it is in the liquid  


2) Built a water bong type syphon to no avail.  


I get a little piddle of fluid but it always stops. "

"77077 Eldridge Energy Corridor area, still nothing. Doesn’t look like I’m getting any sleep tonight"
"77018 w 34th near alba - still no power and my apt is 84 degrees. Thought the nearby businesses getting power would mean mine coming back, but no. Super frustrating since some of my complex has had electricity for days. "
"Any update to 77459? Cartwright and La Quinta? Last I heard, around 11am today, there were linemen in the area. Haven't heard peep since then."
Ain't expecting much but does anyone have an update for 77040 any update as to if and when power might come back on?
"Any news on 77532, the Crosby area? Haven't seen a truck out here yet 🫤"
"77581 Pearland-east or hwy 35-Pearland pkwy/Dixie Farm??
I got home from work yesterday 7/9 a little close to 6pm and power was on. Got super excited and started cleaning and unplugging generator and after 20 minutes power shut off and has yet to come back. Shittypoint drove around for a little after and we thought they were working on it but they left around 7pm and have not been back. Lots of neighbors reported the outage again but shittypoint has not updated anyone"
Any word for 77098 off Buffalo Speedway? I'm starting to get really frustrated that everyone around us has power and it feels like we are a low priority being fewer people without power. I haven't seen any trucks or lineman.
77565 no power in all of Kemah.
"77004, midtown by 288/McGowen. Still no power. It’s insane that it’s going on 72 hours with no power"
"77054 by Holly hall

My complex mostly has power but my buildings and adjacent ones do not"
77070 Lakewood Forest area power came on at 7 pm last night.  At 5 pm prior they flickered 3 times.  So if you get any flickering where you are I guess it means they are working on it.  I’m wishing you all get it very soon.
77080…. Anyone ? There are parts ( Spring Branch) on but lots still out. This is getting too much
"Any update on 77018 near oak forest elementary, they shafted us last time!"

77036 Forum Park still zero power? I’m straight up not having a good time
"I noticed that alot of the street lights that are working are being run off generators (Sugarland and Missouri City ), so the street lights working doesn't mean the area has power "
77069 Champions any updates?
[deleted]
"77441 - updated map went from orange to dark green. Yet we do not have power on the entire block. Only the businesses facing 1093, which were restored the day after the storm."
77478 in brookside. They restored the line that was down in my backyard but did not restore power. Very concerned as this neighborhood has a lot of elderly folks. My mother’s house in 77479 new territory still does not have power. Apparently they were waiting to receive a part that they were missing. Here’s hoping these are all good signs lol
"77011 Lockwood and Navigation no eta for our building, says energized but we have partial power. Called rhythm they can't give an eta either I don't know what to do."
[deleted]
"Well, the side of the street opposite me has power, but nothing on my side. I’m in Oak Forest. 

An interesting twist from some folks on the opposite side they say they have wires down in their backyard, but Centerpoint has still electrified that side of the street. (it doesn’t quite sound right to me, but I’m getting this secondhand.) I could totally believe Centerpoint weaving a dangerous situation in place, and going ahead with starting up the power, just so it could improve its numbers. I wouldn’t have thought it works that way, but at this point, I wouldn’t put anything past Centerpoint."
"77070 on Hargrave right behind Houston Methodist Willowbrook off 249. No power. They assessed on Day 2, but I haven’t seen them come back. I posted a video on my IG of what the damage looks like less than an hour ago: [IG video of downed lines](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9S_CUJpAHD/?igsh=bmthOHE0d3h3dGhh)"
"77088 - Inwood Forest area. No power still. We escaped to Waller to an aunts house that had AC and room to spare, but haven’t had the chance to go home yet. "
"77089, Sageadow along Blackhawk. Power just turned on for like 30 seconds and then went off again. Hopefully that means it's coming back soon

Edit: my mom came back from taking our dog on a walk and said she saw a bunch of a electric trucks a few streets away from us, so now I'm even more hopeful"

"77060 greens rd & imperial valley drive update: No power still, whole map is blue now as if that means anything(We will continue to provide estimated restoration times as they become available). The only thing I've seen being fixed is the sidewalk,  so that's cool."
Oh god. This weather isn’t going to help
77092 by Clifton middle school back online at 12.15pm
[deleted]
"77571 - Power still out but Mom said she saw 3 Centerpoint trucks near my house. What that means I will see I guess.

Side note for those lucky enough to have a generator and window unit tape up your door jams with masking or duct tape and jam a towel under the door. You have to plan trips and it makes a hell of a noise when opening it but makes a huge difference.

Also the return in the ceiling was just raining down hot air into the room so I closed it, covered with a sheet of foil, and sealed with duct tape.

And all the seals around the windows where the unit is mounted to keep hot AC exhaust from coming back in.

The AC was doing it's best but needed some help, I hope this helps yours."
Any good news for 77373 around spring crossing?
77049 I’m out and there seems to be no sight of center point or workers
What are people without water doing for toileting? My friends said kids at her complex have started going in the parking lot 😳😳😳
"77089, Sagemeadow, along Blackhawk. Not home, but my mom just texted me we got power back a few minutes ago. Hopefully it'll stay on"
"77028 - the neighborhood of Kashmere High School. 
Power came on about 3 pm today (Fri Jun 12) and went back off at about 4 pm.


The outage map shows us currently in blue and has a restoration eta for June 12 end of day. "
77091- Pinemont Plaza (Tidwell and TCJ)-bucket trucks around the neighborhood and CPE says we should be online sometime tonight. Hooooopeful?
77007 and still no power in my uncle's apartment complex. Stuck here in HTown and need to head back to LA ASAP but don't know how and when.
77020 near Nance. finally got power around 2pm!!!
"77090 apartments near me have power, but not my complex. Wondering if the multiple down lines and trees on Wild Oak have anything to do with us not getting power. "

"

77011 ( Lockwood & Navigation )

I think the power is back and my water is back, I surely hope people get their powerback, fuck centerpoint"
Still no power 77070 mist ln 😭😩
Power has been out at my house again for 9 hours now in 77441. For 4 hours CenterPoint claimed there wasn’t an issue and then at hour 4 send a message saying it’s planned maintenance and we can’t get any answers or updates as to when the power will be back.
77069 Champions Park Dr on 1960 infront of Target has power. Finally!
"77459 – Colony Lakes near 1092/Murphy and Hwy 6 seems to have power back. Riverstone area behind it as well, as of about 4 hours ago."
"77057, woodway and fountain view.  Still no power, staying with friends.  Tracker is offering no estimation date, so I’m worried that means another week of this.  Appreciate any input from people in the area."
77090 ponderosa forest lights came back on about 30 mins ago
77077 no power lakeside suburbs. Saw a bunch of power trucks at westheimer and wilcrest. A few near Hayes and briar forest.

"77045 Power finally came on sometime this morning, after 3am."
Can someone update me on 77379 Shannon forest please  I just need to know how close are we to having power bro 😭
"77477 - Power came back on at our office some time last night. We're near Kirkwood and Airport.

Edit - Centerpoint map still shows us a ""Restoration Date Pending Review"". At least they added some restoration dates to the map, but this is ridiculous."
It so upsetting the surroundings area of my apartment in 77077 shows to be energized but not my side. Even the other apartments  across the street that belong to the same complex shows to to have power.
In what intervals is the outage map updated?
"77012 has nothing in our little blocks. I see power trucks on the north side of Harrisburg around 75th st but no guarantees that will do anything for us.

77061 at Monroe and Rockhill has some low voltage power. Can’t run an AC or power any appliances but lights and ceiling fans work and that is a huge relief."
"77086 got power like 30 min ago. For what it's worth, yesterday we had not ETA. And the new updated map had us under getting power by 15, and south section by 16. The south section got done earlier and now us. So if you want some hope they seem to be working really fast, couldn't ask for more badass linemen."
77063 south gessner/westheimer power back up and running. Good luck to everyone 🤘🏼
77024 chimney rock and i10 power was just restored as of 2 minutes ago
Power is up mist ln apartment 77070 😊
"Managed to finally rest, but the neighborhood across the road from me still doesn't have power. 77088 by 249"
Back on at 77056
"I’m in a nested outage of 40-50 homes. Received word from Centerpoint that they were assessing the outage. I have no idea what that means, but somewhat comforting that they are at least aware of it I guess. 77025  (Academy/N. Braeswood)for reference."
"77055 -- shows energized, but a small group of 77 homes don't have power ""for some reason"" 

I am seriously doubting we will get power even in the next 5 days..."
77380 budde road/sawdust just got power!!!! 🎉🎉🎉
77043 west of shadowdale near Beltway 8 just got power back around 3:28 !!!!!

Just had power restored in 77014 😭😭😭😭
"77459, Quail Valley (1092 and Hwy 6) near middle school has power for about an hour! Got a notification and had my sister check! Finally."
"Apparently my apartment in 77077 in the gentry side - Whittington area has got power. My sister got an email from management claiming to be a full power and my mom called a neighbor to confirm. Hopefully are lights stay on. We are probably going to go back in the morning.


There is hope people, our estimated date was Wednesday and we thought we would just be leeching off from our family friend."
anyone heard anything yet on meyer forest apartments on 77096(not lakeside but the other apartments)
77096 by Herod. Just got power ~830pm. The CenterPoint map has us planned for today. Trucks in the area earlier today.
"77018 - Ella and Lehman, still no power"
"77025 apt Complex on Buffalo Speedway. No power since Monday. CP came and fixed less than half the buildings and the rest of us have been getting conflicting reports on when the power will be fixed. Some agents say EOD everyday, some say no reports found, some say no technician has been assigned. There have been trucks in the area but they wont come help us. It’s more than 150 people without power and there have been some security incidents. I dont know if we are a nested outage and so just left to die in the heat.

Edit: Oh and we show as energized in the map"
"My corner of 77380 has power as of this morning. Our apartment sent out a text and I was able to verify through Xfinity today we are online and have devices connected to the gateway. 

Centerpoint still shows our meter is offline. 🙄"
77044 off c e king finally has power 🎉

"77055 near Westview/Antoine -- just got power back around 2:15pm

Also feel like CP didn't know that my neighborhood was showing as ""energized"" when it really wasn't, they were surprised by it and power turned on a few hours later. Could be coincidence."
77076 near Parker and hardy power is finally back!
77096 we see the centerpoint truck over here but he keeps leaving and coming back. Praying for service today. We have ran out of food. Smh.
"I swear every time I refresh the centerpoint outage page, the outage number goes up."

77054 holly hall just got power 1 mins ago. 
77006: Finally got power this afternoon around 4:30pm. 🙌🏽
"77459, no power and now no water. It’s getting worse."
"77086 - I think CenterPoint is juking the power restored stats. I have periodically checked their website during the past couple of days. [Occasionally my meter reads that it is “powered on” on their website like in this screen grab.](https://imgur.com/a/kBbbXqC) Power was restored to some of my neighborhood except for the few streets close to my house. A benign, but bad for me scenario is that CenterPoint honestly believes that my power has been restored, so they are not going to send a repair crew."
"Got my estimate and its not until Saturday evening, oh boy. Thanks for literally nothing centerpoint."
"77042, bw8 and briar forest, power just came back!!! 🙌"
77598 still no power.  My neighbors across the street still have lights.  It's been 24 hours now.  I can't sleep.  I have a headache.  The weed isn't working man.

Leaving generator and window unit in place, filled up gas cans when I made it to the store for the first time since the Friday before the storm.

Bonus points: Centerpoint says our entire area is energized our Mayor says this is a lie. And that he has spoken to state officials who have assured him the legislature will hold Centerpoint accountable for their bungled response.

I am sure it will be the kind of investigation where they investigate themselves and find no wrong doing.

(My kid has his ACT there on Saturday. Prepping for it in the heat and dark has sucked, but still would like him to be able to actually take it instead of getting it pushed back from a mental prep POV. Very minor issue all things considered, I know, but he already had a huge last-minute delay with his AP Physics exam thanks to the derecho, so I feel for him with this! It's hard enough being a teenager.)"

"77586 - Seabrook / Repsdorph Rd area. Last night the city of el Lago told residents that centerpoint is going to come into their backyards to assess and fix damage to lines from fallen trees. For good reason—there’s an enormous fallen tree in some guys backyard by loch lake dr off Repsdorph that’s taken down the line that probably goes to us unlucky sods down the road. Centerpoint workers are nearby but are not actively working on clearing this debris, looks like they may have to take someone’s fence down to just get access to the line. Might be a while."

Entergy Texas Hurricane Beryl Alert

Sunday, July 14, 2024 – 9:30 a.m.

TEXAS

Crews restore power to more than 90% of customers by Hurricane Beryl

Entergy Texas crews continue working around the clock to restore power to our communities and have successfully restored power to more than 90% of customers impacted by Hurricane Beryl. As of 9:30 a.m. Sunday, approximately 231,400 of the 252,460 impacted customers have been restored.

Strong winds and heavy rainfall caused widespread vegetation-related damage to distribution lines, which is the main cause for extended outages. Restoration crews are using special equipment to reach hard-to-access areas and make repairs as quickly as possible.

The majority of remaining customers are expected to be restored before the end of the day Sunday, with customers in the most heavily damaged areas (Cleveland and New Caney networks) expected to be restored no later than Monday, July 15.

The chart below provides an update on expected restoration times in specific areas of our service territory. Keep in mind that these restoration times are estimates and times may change based on severity of damages and weather conditions.

7/14/2024 5pm

* Huntsville Network (includes Corrigan, Groveton, Madisonville, New Waverly, Normangee, North Zulch, Trinity, and surrounding areas)

"So - I've been without power now for coming up on 3 days (420am Monday morning).  (I'm fortunate to have bought a generator and kept it running over the last few years).  I live in what is supposedly the hardest hit zip code in Brazoria County, the county where the storm made landfall.  

It makes sense to me that after a hurricane comes through, there will be some power outages and that some of those outages will take a while to be resolved.  

In my area, they've been working over the past 6 months at replacing wooden poles with metal ones, but they were nowhere near done.  I see a lot of people angry at Centerpoint for taking so long (and hey, I'm going to have a party of some sort when my AC comes back on) and Greg Abbott for being on a foreign trip during a crisis.  

My question is - has anyone seen analysis that shows that Centerpoint was especially bad at responding?  That political policy in Texas contributed to the current widespread outages?  I'm asking in good faith, I really don't know anything about how this infrastructure is managed.

Edit:  Yeesh.  Ask a question ..."

Is it getting any better for you guys down there? There is a lot of articles written about there still being issues. I saw center point or whoever said some would have to wait weeks for power?
"Probably an unpopular opinion -- but Centerpoints communication / online updates are far more improved than they were during the derecho. It's super frustrating for all, but given that Centerpoint is dealing with the biggest utility crisis in the USA at this time...I am cutting them some slack, not a lot, but some."
People relax- try 11 days with no power( hurricane harvey).You will be fine for a few days- you should have prepared for this outcome.
"If the storm is imminent, fill the bathtub with water. That way, if the water goes out, you can still flush your toilet. Have gallons of water on hand. If electricity goes out, eat your food that’s in the fridge and freezer first. Then the canned goods. Sandwich stuff is good. PB&J are non perishable. 

Candles or flashlights (or whatever light source); radio & batteries; medications; cash(!!!) because atm & credit card machines may not work; full tank of gas; at least move your car to a parking garage nearby on the 2nd floor or above and park facing the inner wall of the building where the car isn’t exposed to flying debris; put important documents and photos in a big ziplock and inside a storage tub; take video of your belongings in case you need it for insurance 

Most Houstonians will stay put. On the road is often more dangerous than in the house. Price gouging is technically illegal, but it still happens during hurricanes."
"I usually evacuate a couple of days before the storm once I know there’s a high degree of certainty that a category 3 or greater is likely to affect the area. Where is your family? It might be a great excuse to go spend a few days with them.

Freeze a cup of water in your freezer, then place a coin on top of the ice. If the cup melts then refreezes while you’re gone you’ll know to throw away everything in your fridge/freezer. 

Beryl is supposed to be a tropical storm after it crosses the Yucatán. I’m not thinking about evacuating yet. I may reassess on Saturday once the hurricane is in the Gulf

If you’re nervous and want to be proactive you can book a pet-friendly hotel and plan on evacuating. Just make sure it’s cancellable and refundable. I generally like to evacuate north and to the west and try to avoid anywhere along major highways like I-10, 290, 45, 59. Waco/Temple are good, but if the rest of the city is evacuating too and you’re coming from Clear Lake it’s gonna be hard to get through Houston. Depending on where it ends up hitting you might be better off trying to take backroads to San Antonio"
">the hurricane reaching a level 5 is freaking me out

Breathe.  Now go read the updates.  While it's good to be prepared, I think you should really take a look at the last update.  Do not get your news from the local media stations.  They're trying to freak you out on purpose.

Also, it's cat 5 over the ocean.  It's expected to be considerably weaker in a few days.

https://theeyewall.com/"
"Regardless of what happens with Beryl, having a kit and a plan is a good idea, so while I agree I don’t think there’s cause to evacuate at this time, it’s always a good time to put your plan together. https://www.houstonoem.org/pages/Prepare

As for your specific concerns about first floor — if you apartment floods when it normally happens in Houston, then it probably would in a hurricane or tropical storm too. Since you weren’t here for Harvey I think it’s worthwhile to note that the Harvey flooding was VERY unprecedented and due to the storm system hovering over us for days with continuous rain, which is very atypical behavior for a storm like this and not likely to reoccur the same way."
"There are going to be a dozen named hurricanes this year that *could* hit Houston in one of the 50 spaghetti models. You can't get overworked about every one of them. If it is a big one, you will have 2-3 days notice before it hits. Panic is unsustainable because this happens every year and will drive you crazy.  

Others have posted great tips to make sure you know if your fridge lost power and how to have water to flush your toilet. Just follow those tips and evacuate if needed."
"Hurricane strength has little to do with rain totals. Just look at Harvey. It is a measure of wind speed. Should a cat 5 shoot up I45 at a pretty good pace (10mph+), you may have to worry about storm surge depending on where you are in Clear Lake.

What can you do though? Renters insurance #1. Flood insurance #2. But really, your most likely largest worry would be flying debris in a storm that strong, or a prolonged power outage. Plywood covering all windows in such a storm would not be a bad idea either."
"I've lived nearly all my 54 years in hurricane-vulnerable places. Here's my advice.

1. Determine if flooding is likely where you are. Did your area flood for Allison? Harvey? Ike? If the answer for any of those is ""yes"" then consider evacuating ahead of landfall to another location. Note that evac doesn't mean ""hightail it to Kansas."" Coming north into the city, into areas that don't flood, would be fine. 

2. For anything making landfall near us at Category 3 or lower, stay put if there's no storm surge danger for you. Hunker down, stay away from windows -- hang heavy drapes if you can -- and stock up on fresh water and non-perishable food. 

3. Ensure you have a couple USB batteries for you phone and other bits. Last time we got a real storm in the Houston area, cell service came back before landline did. 

4. Yeah, a wind-up or otherwise rechargeable radio is a good idea. 

5. Get a few flashlights. 

6. Fill your tub with water to use for flushing the toilet. 

7. ... or, go one further and get one of those tub bladders you can use to stage potable water in your tub. 

8. Finally, in hurricane country, **consider your car to be OUT OF GAS if you get below half a tank at ANY point between May and October**. And definitely be full if there's a storm in the gulf. 

I've lived in Houston for 30 years, and in Montrose for 24 of them, and we've never evac'd. We lost power for Ike, but only for 3 days. We've never been threatened by wind here -- everything's too dense.

**NOW** if a storm is coming ashore in Galveston at Cat 4 or Cat 5, yeah, I might want to get the hell out of dodge if I lived in Clear Lake. A Cat5 coming straight up 45 towards the city might get US to head to Austin or whatever, even. 

But Beryl isn't that for us -- I mean, it could reorg into a threat after crossing the Yucatan, but it's very unlikely (at least per Berger). The rest of the season could definitely get sporty though, so you're wise to be thinking about this."
"I’m in Clear Lake as well. 

Cat 5, evacuate. If you ever feel scared or need any assistance during a big storm or hurricane though, feel free to hmu/DM me. I’ll come get you and your cat (pet friendly household and vehicle made to handle high water/weather) and you can hunker down with us or evac with me. My husband is FD and doesn’t evacuate, but we’re more than fully prepared. Have a kit together like everyone has outlined above and keep all together in the same area, so it’s on-hand should you need it (don’t forget extra pet food! Stock up on canned food and an extra couple bags of kibble when it’s on sale.)

I know how scary it can be living halfway across the country from family and experiencing something like this on your own the first time or at all (I went through all of Harvey solo at home with our pets) so I’m happy to help out should you need it."
"As others mentioned:

Cash, 

Gallon waters,

Non perishables for food,

All the usual tricks at home (bathtub water, candles, rechargeable fans if you can, flashlights, classic radio for emergency line, etc.).

Fill car gas tank up (do this well before anything, and be careful at gas stations in time of need, and don't be surprised if someone snakes your tank at an apartment building),

Backup battery chargers for phone.


However, if it's a cat 4 or 5 with a direct hit, I wouldn't be staying in clear lake. I'd be evacuating. If you can at least. That also will need to be done 2+ days beforehand. 140-200mph sustained winds can pretty much devastate an area.

If water starts to rise in a first floor apartment, you need to immediately act. It'll only get worse. Find higher ground in your building if you can."
"Beryl is likely going to just be a tropical depression by the time it gets to the US - a cat 1 or even tropical storm when it hits Mexico. This isn’t the storm to worry about; but you should still plan for a hurricane.

That being said - hurricanes aren’t 100% predictable so get food and water just in case; and monitor the news."
"If I was in clear lake, I would evacuate if we had a big cat 4 or 5 heading our way. I remember during Ike, they drew a line that was kinda close to I 10 and then went south the further west you got, and if you were north of the line they recommended riding it out, south they recommended getting out of dodge."
"In Clear Lake, I’d evacuate if you’re near the water, if it’s 3 or more. I’ve only evacuated for Rita (the one we had after Katrina devastated Nola), but that evacuation was awful. The worst part if you stay, is the mosquitos and no power. People generally came together and helped each other, so you’d be ok, but if you have the means to leave, it’s way more comfortable, especially if you’re renting. Make sure your insurance is  good, and take a few days. Most employers around here (making a generalization, as an employer) understand, and would not be against working with you if you evacuate. (And I would think it would be actionable if they tried to prevent you from leaving if we were under an order). 
But staying- solar power lanterns, battery backups for phone, and a mosquito fogger (you’ll be the most popular person in your building).  Fill your freezer with old jugs of water. If power goes out, the most full your freezer is, the longer it stays cold. Can also move them to cooler to preserve stuff, if you stay."
"First, take a deep breath and calm down. Adding panic to the situation will only make things worse. You have a long time to get ready if a hurricane is coming. My wife put it best during her first season on the gulf: ""Watching the hurricane is like being stalked by a snail"". 

Here are some steps you can take to ease your anxiety. I'm sure others on this sub can add to this list: 

1. Be weather aware but do not engage in panic porn. There are some newstations and weather sources that are much better than others. In my opinion, Iscovitz on Fox 26 is fairly level headed. Herzog on ABC13 tends to blow things out of proportion. Best in my opinon are the Space City Weather guys. Subscribe to their email, both the Eye Wall and Space City weather, and/or their social media feeds on your preferred platforms. 

2. Be prepared. Make a decision before time compresison becomes a factor. What I mean by that, is have a plan before a storm is on your doorstep. Decide what level of storm will drive you to evacuate. For my family and I, we are leaving at a 3 and up. We will evaluate at a 2. We will stay for a 1. We are also in the Clear Lake area. 

Prepare an evacuation plan. Do you have somewhere to go? Do you have a means to get there? Plan a route. Set aside money, if possible, to meet any lodging needs. If you do not have your own car, research the counties evacuation services. There are buses provided and shelters. Know where these are and how to reach your closest one. 

Prepare essentials for an evac. For us those include: 

1. Basic tool kit.

2. First Aid Kit. 

3. Sleeping bags. 

4. Dry food and bottled water.

5. Flash lights. 

6. Portable batteries.

7. Portable radio. 

8. Tent. 

9. Extra gas.

  
Decide what items are going and which are staying before the storm comes. 

Decide on a plan to pack up. We split up duties. I carry heavy stuff upstairs and my wife packs the car. 

Time compression is the enemy of good decision making. When you are short on time, you are short on options. The more work you can do before you have to evacuate, the better. You will have DAYS to prepare though. Keep that in mind. 

  
If you are planning on staying: 

1. Fill your bathtub with water. 

2. Procure at least one gallon of water for each person in the house for 14 days. Meaning, if you have 4 people in your house, store away 56 gallons of fresh water in preparation for the storm. 

3. Charge all devices, portable batteries, etc. 

4. Know what your neighbors plans are. Help each other. Keep in touch. 

5. Have a portable and battery operated radio. 

6. Stock plenty of batteries and flashlights. 

7. Grab a supply of dry food that can feed your household for 7 days. 



There are plenty more good ideas out there. The big thing is, do not panic. Have a plan and execute your plan. Have decision gates built in so you know when you are doing what and how you are doing it.

"Get flood insurance. It takes 30 days to go into effect after your payment, but if your apartment floods, you’ll at least get your items replaced. And it’s easier to get food/housing assistance."
"Hey homie. Also in clear lake. Ask if your apartment has a generator. If not I’d prepare a bugout plan if your work schedule allows. Get an air bnb in San Marcus or something, you can get there over backroads. I’m outa here if anything greater than a tropical storm hits. Don’t try to ride shit out unless you gotta. Very worst case, my roomate is a firefighter and will be in town. DM me and I’ll pass along what he says about power and communal shelter"
"Have a plan ready before anything has to be done (which for Beryl is still unlikely at this point - but keep checking the official updates to see if anything has changed). But, do you have friends or relatives north of Houston you could stay with for example? Or maybe west of town? Galveston, Brazoria and far southern Harris County are likely going to be asked to evacuate if a bad storm is likely. But usually Montgomery, parts of Fort Bend and then counties west and north of that are in a better spot (although they would probably be without power if a bad storm made landfall close to Houston). That's just one thing of many to think about. You can easily read other things to consider when you make a plan of action just in case."
"I feel like after Ike most people would rather just ""hunker down"" and it seems like a lot of the advise you are getting lean that way. I would check around to see what previous flooding has been like where you are. Then I would move to a 2nd floor apartment and double check my renters insurance to make sure it covers flooding."
Put everything valuable up high. Go to Austin for a week.
"I live in La Porte but grew up in League City right by the water my whole life. If a cat 3 or higher is coming  my family and I would always evacuate. And I still evacuate now that I live on my own. DO NOT stay here for a category 4 or 5. That is absolutely catastrophic. Category 3 or less, I would have battery packs, lamps, a hand crank radio, a fan, a heavy duty cooler, water, non perishable food, first aid kits, and a plan in case water comes in."
"I’m in clear lake and I evacuate for anything projected to be 3 or higher. Ike was weaker than that when it hit and at the time I was living off of Dixie farm and had a tree fall on our apartment. I’m glad I wasn’t there for that. 

Now I’m block or so away from the water on 2 sides and after Harvey have no plans to ride anything out. Our house didn’t flood, but we were stuck in our house for a few days due to street flooding. 

That being said. I’m not too worried about this storm currently."
"Scout a parking garage within walking distance of your house.  If you think your neighborhood will flood, you can store your car on an upper level, but not the roof."
"In the lead up to any event that might mean prolonged power/water outages, I advise you to wash everything you can. Do your laundry. Wash your dishes. Wash yourself, wash your hair. If you are stuck without water for days, you will be glad to have plenty of clean clothes and linens.

Grab some wet wipe type things if you can. They are better than nothing if you are feeling gross and sticky when showering is not an option."
"One thing I would suggest is starting right now eat up all of the frozen food that you have in the freezer at every meal until it's gone that way if you do lose power you won't  have to throw out a bunch of bad food 

Second is if you do not have a propane or butane camping stove go to academy and get one because if you lose power then you can still cook hot food and also you can boil water if the water supply is contaminated. 

When you go to the store for supplies I mainly shelf-stable foods and canned foods that don't require refrigeration. My paper plates so you don't have to do dishes if water is an issue. Buy one each of the jumbo size toilet paper and paper towels for obvious reasons. You don't need to buy out the whole store just get one extra big package of those. By 3 gallons of drinking water per person in the households"
"Being on the first floor, the first thought that would come to my mind is flooding. Note that flooding happens not just from an abundance of rain, like Harvey, but storm surge. Clear Lake is (imo) in an uncomfortable range for the unfortunate impacts of storm surge. This is highly dependent on the exact track of the storm as it makes landfall. Also worth noting that it doesn’t take a strong hurricane to produce a damaging storm surge. Even a tropical storm can have a damaging storm surge. 
If it were me I would ensure I have ample resources for about a week, and I would be monitoring the morning and evening discussions from the National Hurricane Center, National Weather Service, and Space City Weather. Should the forecast weather models continue to trend toward landfall in TX by Saturday, I would make plans to drive inland before more people make the same decision. In my opinion, I wouldn’t risk getting stuck in an area that would flood, especially if I lived so close to the water because being isolated in a building and surrounded by water doesn’t sound too ideal to me. (Again that’s worst case scenario.)"
Do you have renter's insurance? Also check if you can get flood insurance for NAMED STORMS for a renter.
"Make sure you have rental insurance. Any important papers, you want to gather in a waterproof bag. So if you have to leave, you take the bag with you. Include in the bag important contact numbers just in case your phone fails or the network is overloaded. Don’t forget information about meds and health conditions if that applies. 

Aside from making sure your rental insurance is active, have a plan already. Since this is your first time in a bottom floor apartment, think about what your stress tolerance is. And have a plan to leave. Where you are going and tell someone."
"I’m sure it’s been said already, but make sure you have a lot of extra food for your pets as well."
"Hey my friend. I was in a first floor apartment when hurricane Harvey hit. I don’t know if the current hurricane is going to hit us, but I lost everything in my place in Harvey. In the middle of the night when the water came in I got up and tried to find somebody in a second-floor apartment, who would let us in and nobody would. The water was up to my waist outside and it was over 24 inches inside. I had to break open a vacant second floor apartment so my family and I had a safe place to stay.
The lesson I learned: when a hurricane decides to head this way ( if this one doesn’t another one will) Head out of town and take your most important personal belongings with you.
BUT Wait and see first if The hurricane is headed this way first. A lot can happen between now and then and the storms out in the ocean are very unpredictable. I have been through nine hurricanes, and I only was hit by one, but the one that I did get hit with was an experience I never want to live again."
"Also put X shapes with masking tape or duct tape on the inside of all your windows. That will prevent the windows from breaking and shattering inward. It will hold the glass. If you can, put your expensive stuff / electronics UP high."
Make sure you have sufficient food and water for your cat for several days. Do you have a crate in case you need to evacuate? Also make sure you have a collar with a tag and contact info and a microchip with current information in case your cat gets out. Might also want to have some of your cats favorite treats in case you need to lure him or her out to evacuate.
Move to the second floor.
I got a hand crank radio/flash light that also charges phones off Amazon.  It was $20 something
"You’ve already got some great advice here, but I would also add that as a new Houstonian/Texan it wouldn’t be a bad idea to have a local and/or state map to help you get around or out of dodge after the storm if needed. Storms and power outages can do weird things to phone service, my cell phone didn’t work at all at my house for days after the derecho…I had to go several blocks away every time I wanted to text or look something up on the internet. 

Years ago my parents gifted my brother and I hand crank radios that also allow you to charge your phone or other devices. It has been pretty useful and doesn’t require me to plan ahead to charge battery packs, etc. 

Mostly get a really good flashlight or two, and stock up on batteries. "
"Got a carrier for your cat? Put extra cat food, meds, bottled water in a backpack you can just grab. A harness and leash will be handy, too, when there’s no access to a litter box- at least you can try to walk them. Put your stuff in a “go bag”, too. Pack some protein bars, pb crackers and the like in your bag, too, in case you get stuck in a school gym or similar when you evacuate."
"Get to know your neighbors and help when you can. Living through a natural disaster is never pleasant but working together with my neighbors (I was able to get us water, another had an outside grill, another was able to make us coffee & we were all in shouting distance if things really went south) made the ‘21 freeze more bearable."
Make friends with floor 2 people.
"I've survived hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods in trailers and apartments. It is equally important to be prepared as it is not to panic. Stay calm. As of today, it is only a possibility that it could come close to us. Keep an eye on next couple of days to see where it is going. Another consideration is that, it will very likely weaken when it goes through land."
Idk if anyone has said this but Make sure you have renters insurance and if you have it already make sure it covers flooding. Take pictures of all your things.
"First, calm down.  

Hurricanes are scary as all hell for new Houstonians, but try to not let it eat at you.  

If you’re really concerned, maybe look at getting a power bank.  Running a generator on your balcony can be dangerous.

With a couple of packs of water and some tinned food, you can ride out most things. 

We’re pretty good at sharing here when the shit comes down.  We want to look after one another.

Make sure you have gas in your vehicle.  If the power goes out, the gas pumps don’t work.  Your car is a good place to keep cool and charge your phone.

Consider finding a good parking spot, as uphill as you can with the exhaust pipe pointing uphill.  You don’t want water in your engine. 

Hit the liquor store.  There’s a reason we call those drinks hurricanes. ;) 

Make sure your animal is looked after.  They can’t eat what you eat.  While your neighbors will probably want to help, they may not have suitable food.  Buy some tinned food. 

Get a manual can opener.

If you’re really in trouble; reach out to someone.  Anyone around you will likely want to help.  Houstonians are good people at their core.  It’s part of the city to come together when it gets really tough. "
"The hurricane is not coming this way, so I think you should kind of chill out.

If we do get a direct hit in the future, you may have to evacuate, but to be honest, even with Ike, you could have sheltered in place."
"There's going to be a lot of wind shear so it should weaken substantially. 

With that said have a hurricane plan. Living close to the coast you need two: one to hunker down, and one to evacuate. If you're hunkering down you need to make sure your apartment hasn't flooded before, ask your neighbors and see what they say. 

Readyharris has some good resources/checklists for this."
"Put your mattress on top of your dining room table, so that you limit the possibly of waking up with an alligator.

Seriously, if a direct hit is imminent, don't stay, head for higher ground even if it's a cheap hotel beyond downtown.  Book early. Even then, it might be a good idea to invest in an inflatable raft.  Store it with your survival kit, the one in your trunk."
"My spouse is essential personnel so we can’t go too far to evacuate. They’re scheduled to work Wednesday. If a hurricane were to hit Monday/tuesday, would evacuating from Galveston to, say, a hotel in Katy suffice?"
"Lived in the Clear Lake area for 11 years after having never experienced hurricanes before. Depending on your financial and work situation, and your personal approach to life, it might be easiest to head over to San Marcos or Austin for a handful of days. 

I have vivid memories of being at work during the 2017 solar eclipse and walking back to our desks and everyone saying Harvey was going to be “no big deal” and not to worry much. By the next day or so, I was too spooked to stick around. Before I left, I put as much furniture/belongings up on countertops that I could (imagine several inches of water in your apartment), grabbed my important documents and photos and loaded the kids and dogs up to head to Austin. We were lucky - I have family there, so we didn’t have to worry about getting a hotel. 

We ended up being in Austin for almost two weeks. I saw pictures on the news of water all the way up to the bottom of a tall highway sign and realized it was the highway we took out just two days before. It was bananas. 

If you are able to find an affordable place to stay somewhere north or west, it could be worth it. I’d just say to leave sooner rather than later because roads will get bananas if things start looking crazy with the storm. Friends poked a bit of fun at me for evacuating and leaving a couple days early, but my drive to Austin was easy peasy. 

Another thing to consider is being without power for days or weeks after a huge storm comes through. Our house ended up not getting any water or damage (which stunned me, because we lived very close to a lake) BUT the power was out for ages and the area was filled with craziness from folks cleaning things out after the storm. I hadn’t thought about the idea of being without power for days and weeks once the storm had passed. We decided to stay away to not further drain any resources and to not have to be there without power and AC. That was also hard, though, because we wanted to be there to help friends.

More often than not, things will probably be fine. You’ve gotten lots of good info from folks here, so I’d just say to trust your gut, weigh the options, and then once you make a decision- commit to it and do all the prep you need for that option. 

I also recommend Space City Weather for updates. Follow them on Twitter and turn on notifications for all their posts. Same with the Hurricane Tracker account. I am still getting notifications from their accounts even after moving away two years ago. Ha! 

Good luck and hang in there!"
Extra kitty litter and food.
"Have lots of bottled drinking water on hand, and also canned or non-perishable food to get through a week or so. Have flashlights, and some candles on hand. Maybe a battery powered radio. You'll be fine. If it's a Cat 5 and heading this way, you should have enough warning to head in land if you feel you need to. 

I live in Clearlake as well, and have been through many hurricanes here, including Harvey. Generally if you don't live right next to one of the bayous, or the lake, you'll be just fine."
Find a nice Air BnB in the hill country and leave
"For your cat - make sure you don't open the windows and the cat can get out.  Screens on apartments are usually pretty flimsy so make sure if you open it's a small crack. 

battery operated fan.

It takes D batteries - and is affordable, can't comment on how it works because haven't tried it out yet."
"I'd also buy some work gloves from Amazon. I purchased a pack of them for less than 10 bucks. I recommend this in the hopefully unlikely event that you need to move debris (glass, trees, etc)."
"If the water is going to come in, get any electronics, books, clothes and what not off of the floor and the bottom shelves/drawers. Get your cat food, water and litter box up too.  

This saved us from a lot of loss during Harvey when we got water into our house."
"Nothing to worry right now. This one in particular isn't going to cause much damage if any to Houston, it's going to hit Mexico/South Texas coast. That being said, have some water bottles, batteries, flashlights ready and stored away, radio isn't necessary if you have a portable phone charger, also your car can be a good enough charger. Keep an eye on the weather throughout the summer, the more time you have to prep the better. 

If in August or later a hurricane is on path for a direct hit and you wanna leave go to Austin or SA if you'll feel you can afford it, I went once just to visit friends and ended up staying a couple weeks (Ike). Otherwise hunker down. Many Houstonians have hurricane parties, a reason to get together and drink and eat. Sometimes power will be out for days/weeks. Other times the storm will blow through or move at the last minute and miss the city anyway (Rita, it was famous for the major evacuation and deaths caused from that. Speaking of deaths, they are extremely, extremely rare. It's mainly loss of property so make sure you're insured.

Honestly none of the major damage that could happen is on your bill since your renting while home owners have to foot the bill if insurance doesn't cover. Relax, you can't control mother nature, just sit back after you've prepped and enjoy the spectacle. Not every storm is going to be a Harvey. And it feels like that derecho a couple weeks back got a lot of the big, dead limbs down so it kinda helped for the next big wind event."
Battery powered and re chargeable fans were my best friends when we lost power for three days after the derecho. Walmart has the 10in O2 cool battery powered fans that take D batteries. Not the highest item on the emergency preparedness list but a good consideration for no power during Houston summer heat.
"I think people have done a pretty good job otherwise, but for where to go...Personally? We go to stay with family that's about about 2-3 hours further in land. Obviously not an option for you, but it might be worth talking to people here that you're close to (friends, co-workers, etc) and seeing if they have any suggestions. You might be lucky and one of them might know someone who'd let you crash there. 

Though, if you are wanting to evacuate (And, ngl, depending on where you are, if a major hurricane is going to hit, I'd seriously consider it since you're on the first floor), keep carriers easily accessible for your cats, and a supply of their food, litter and maybe their favorite toys easy to grab.

Also, Re: Beyrl specifically - atm, it doesn't seem like something to worry too much about hitting Houston. Though I'd also suggest keeping on eye on something like Space City Weather\* just in case.

\*Suggesting them specifically because they're local and very good about being straight forward/not hyping weather forecasts."
"If you’re going to evacuate, you need to be long gone before the first drop of rain falls. IOW, if you decide to stay in place, don’t second guess unless you have water coming into your apartment. Trying to leave once the hurricane is here is far more likely to lead to death 

Lots of advice here on supplies. Do be wary of “storm surge”. It can stop raining, but the flood waters keep climbing for 12 or 24 hours. Don’t risk driving again until you can clearly see the road, and if you drive somewhere and see flooding, turnaround"
If a cat 5 is coming you fill your car with as much shit as you can and get the F outta here
If a cat 5 is coming you fill your car with as much shit as you can and get the fuck outta here
Drive in land like Dallas area and stay for a few days at a hotel or shelter
"I would suggest having a storm tracker on your phone.

I use Hurricane Tracker (channel 2's app), Weather Underground, My Radar Pro for apps

I also follow Eric Berger: Space City Weather on Facebook - I think there is an app now.

Hurricane tracker . net - this shows all of the models and tracking as well.

Predicted storms tracks can change pretty quickly within a couple of hours, so it's nice to be able to see the latest predicted path.

Unfortunately sometimes coverage of storms can be sensationalized. I like Space city weather, because he gives you the weather in a way that is easy to understand and upfront.

For storms, there is a clean side and a dirty side. The dirty side is where you will see storm surge, extreme wind, flooding, tornadoes and heavier rain bands. Storms go counterclockwise, so the dirty side is on the right side of the storm (however it is traveling - so if the storm is heading in a north direction, the dirty side would be the east side. if the storm was traveling west, the dirty side would be the north/north-east side.) Even if the storm doesn't hit land or hits land somewhere else, it can still send in storm surges that we need to watch out for. We saw this two weeks ago when that storm hit Mexico, Galveston (unfortunately during high tide) had storm surges.

  
Since you live on the first floor, I would ask around to your neighbors and your complex manager and see how the flooding was during Harvey. That would give you a good idea if your apt could flood or not."
"- You can load up Tupperware items with drinking water, freeze them and then use as they thaw. They’ll keep the freezer cold as long as possible. Alternatively, buy bottled water and store it in the freezer. 
- Check the government sites for preparedness checklists. Think about where you might park your car to avoid damage — is there free garage nearby? 
- Battery or solar operated lantern — always useful with our frequent power outages 
- battery or solar powered radio to get news during power outage while sparing your phone battery 
- power bank for your cell phone 
- food for your pet
- keep important documents in a waterproof baggie or container

DON’T PANIC until we know it’s actually aiming at us. And then don’t panic because you’ll have a plan. 

Source: I’ve lived through Hurricanes Celia, Alicia, and Ike as well as the ugly floods here for the last four decades."
"I suggest keep cash on hand. If power is out, in most places the credit/debit card machine will not work. Cash is king when there are power outages

Also full up gas tank in car before storm hits"
"If you have a car, park it some place high like a covered garage 2nd floor..."
"We used to freeze gallons or half gallons milk jugs with clean water and keep those in an ice chest. If the power goes out, we put perishables in with the jugs so we didn’t open the fridge often. And as the ice melts, you have cool water to drink. Rock salt and ice in baggies also super cools things. 

Put a penny on a frozen cup of water in the freezer. If the power goes out for too long, it’ll sink and you know the food is likely not safe. 

Have water in the tub, etc so you can flush the toilet. 

If they aren’t boarding up the windows, use duct tape to keep them from shattering too badly. Either an X or an asterisk. If you are worried about flooding, have towels on hand to stop water from gushing in. 

Keep your phones fully charged and have a power bank fully charged if you have one. During storms or in power outages, text, don’t call. The towers often fail but texts can go through. 

If you have pets, make sure you have food and a potty place. Puppy pads are great for emergencies. 

If you have a car, make sure you are filled up beforehand. Have a small gas can with gas is necessary - but be very careful with having that in an apartment. If the city power goes out for long, gas is hard to get and can take hours, but you can charge your phone and get some AC in the car. 

Have non-perishable foods that you don’t have to cook. Canned beans and veggies are easiest. 

Have something to do that isn’t electric. Books. Crosswords. A puzzle. Something that will take your mind off things.  

Do not go outside when the wind stops. I’f you are in the eye of a storm, it will stop and it will be eerily silent out. But that wind will come back with a vengeance. 

Flooding isn’t too bad unless you are on the dirty side (east side of the storm) or it’s super slow moving. And it’s not the wind that is dangerous. It’s the shit blowing in the wind. 

It’s scary sometimes, but keep your head and you’ll likely be fine. Follow evac orders if they come through. Sleeping in your car in Tomball is a hell of a lot safer than riding out a storm they tell you to leave. Have cash in case you have to evac.  Do not tell people you have cash or flash it. If you have to use cash, only show the minimum you have to show to get what you need."
Make sure you have content insurance. 100%.
"Many first floor apartments flood. Even without flooding, it can be very uncomfortable to live for several days without electricity in the summer. From experience, my family generally tries to leave town at least a day before - staying with friends or rented a motel about 250 miles away. It doesn't hurt to have a motel reservation in Austin or the Dallas area.

The advice on staying in place with water buckets and flashlights is fine, too.

I repeat, many first floor apartments and homes throughout that area flood (indeed all over the Houston area). The rains from Hurricane Harvey flooded an estimated 350 homes in Clear Lake and more than 7,000 in Dickinson. 

If you have a car, it will likely be flooded too unless you are fortunate to have a concrete parking structure and can park a level up.

Clear Lake Flood Map: [https://riskfactor.com/neighborhood/clear-lake-texas/9569\_fsid/flood](https://riskfactor.com/neighborhood/clear-lake-texas/9569_fsid/flood)"
"If your location suggests evacuation, do it and know the routes out and where you intend to go. Have a “go bag” packed and ready with important documents and clothes. You may not have time to save much. If you have to leave, the sooner the better."
"In addition to the other comments, I would say plan out your apartment space in such a way that you can minimize flood concerns. Is it carpeted or hardwood through the majority of it? Try to place items smartly in such a way that A) you can grab important items in a hurry if needed* and B) that whatever is left behind won't succumb to floodwater if it floods.  
  
In regards to B, I helped gut a few homes in Meyerland after the Harvey floods. The problem was that although it wasn't like Katrina with water up to attics and people trapped on rooftops, even just water going in for a foot or so was enough to total just about anything and everything that the water touched. Everything wood or carpet had to be removed down to the concrete foundation and the walls had to have their sheetrock removed to the water line and replaced then repainted.

I'm planning on moving to a first floor soon as it will make cycling so much easier, but when I do I'm going to move around my stuff to plan a bit for elevated protections. That basically means wires/pc/ups on desk or stands so that if water comes in but below the outlets, like say a foot of water or so it could still potentially minimize damage to electronics. Same with tv/entertainment systems that are on a dresser a bit higher up so that the only things getting hit and thrown out are whatever is in the junk drawers underneath. Unfortunately the same cannot be done to appliances like fridge freezer so if that happens, try to keep food elevated but plan on the whole appliance getting thrown out and replaced, at least that's the landlord's liability and not yours IIRC.

*As for important things, plan ahead now in case you need to leave in a hurry. Be it flood, storm induced collapse, fire, whatever be prepared so that you could in theory get out in 5 minutes or less with all your important stuff. Myself I keep a ""go-bag"", an old backpack with a mix of stuff I don't really use a lot but can still come in handy and a few things that I bought. Enough clothes, handheld water filter or filtration tablets that you can buy online or at Academy, some MRE's, pocket map of the state (bit overkill), carabiners to hook it up to other bags, solar charger and cables, and most importantly copies that I made of my important documents like SSN, birth cert, insurance etc. The idea is I could live out of that bag for a week if I needed to and have a few plans of GTFO. Worst case scenario I just grab the bag keys and ditch. If I have a few more minutes and vehicle access I would also try to grab my PC (hard drives inside have backups as well of said documents) and bike and try to load them up, but even in an absolute worst case scenario I can just grab that bag and go."
Have an allocation of the appropriate ammo for looters
"Minor things: by an inexpensive transistor radio and a couple of nine volt batteries. When not in use, be sure to remove such batteries from any radios or flashlights. I have rechargeable lighting systems (from Amazon) that will get me through the first 48 hours plus.

Right now on Amazon, you can spend $30 to buy a table top butane burner with four canisters. This is a one burner stove and with the four canisters you'll have more than enough cooking energy to get you through a week plus. It's also a good thing to have if you have electric cooking and the Texas grid goes belly up during the winter.

Chances are, this particular storm is not going to be much more than a rain event which hopefully goes a bit deeper into Texas. Every year as hurricane season approaches, during every shopping trip I always buy a few more items for my hurricane survival closet. During spring and summer I keep it stocked with all the usual suspects of canned foods, crackers, peanut butter powdered milk cans of evaporated milk and the like.... Including 10 or so plastic gallons of water bought from HEB or wherever (purchased a few gallons at a time). Keep track of expiration dates and after hurricane season use some of your stock for normal cooking/ snacking.

Finally, visit the website, or Facebook page, or YouTube channel called Tropical Tidbits. A very talented meteorologist does excellent work presenting just the facts."
"If you're just in the mood for a road trip, sure, move inland before the weekend. On Friday you can turn on the TV and watch the storm hit Mexico from the comfort of your hotel room while wondering why you wasted your money and stressed out your cat.

Your coworkers probably care very much, but simply have enough experience to know when it's appropriate to be concerned. The likelihood of anything significant happening in our area from this storm remains quite low. If doing something will ease your anxiety though, go buy some extra batteries or order a pack of glow sticks from Amazon. Those are things you can be sure won't go to waste, since you'll need them eventually, storms or no storms."
"I’m also In clear lake in a first floor apartment facing the pool. 

Anytime I move somewhere I always ask the leasing office and any neighbors if it flooded during Harvey or if there are any issues with flooding. 

I would start there if I were you - if they say no it gives you somewhat peace of mind and you can still prepare but more calmly."

"Look , if a cat 5 hits Houston . It’s over . It’ll flood that whole city out . I’d try to find somewhere else out of town to stay. Houston is like New Orleans.. Horrible drainage issues.. Remember Katrina ? It’ll be the same outcome for Houston ."
I filled my bath with water and bought a trash can to also fill with water. After everything was over I returned the trash can.
Plan for evacuation 2-3 days prior to landfall..
"In your instance, I'd only consider it evacuating you're going to be on the dirty side of the storm. 

That is typically when it gets really nasty along the shoreline."
"Request to move to 2nd floor.
So by the time that's approved and you've moved there might be one to worry about"
Wind speeds not seen in over 40 years? Even with the damage we're lucky it wasn't a more sustained storm
Question for the structural engineers here: I don’t recall electric transmission towers getting yeeted like they did yesterday during the last major hurricanes of the last decade. What happened? What was different?
 Is anybody here old enough to remember hurricane Alicia? She was nasty!  I’ll never forget that storm.
People who prefer a Hurricane over a Tornado must not be native Houstonian.
"You gotta remember she's talking to the entire county and saying that it could take that long before EVERYONE has their power reconnected.  Most people will probably have electricity in a few days, but for some it's going to take a bit longer."
"""CenterPoint doesn't know exactly the damage or how long it will take or who is ultimately tied into those transmission lines.""

Wait, what? So they don't know anything? They sound prepared for this."
"So I fucking LUCKED OUT getting power back at 10:30 in Katy, Holy shit."
Now that abbot uncapped the center point energy delivery fee prepare to be gouged.
Yay. Guess I’m not gonna play any video games for a while.
"What was the state of the Harris County grid before the storm hit? Was it in need of repairs and maintenance?

# Harris"
Texas goin for 3rd world country status.
"Bury the cable underground, makes it so much easier to deal with when shit like this happens, I swear why is Houston so dumbfuck when we live in an area that’s prone to this type of climate"
"Hurricanes are hitting Houston more frequently, putting our national energy infrastructure at risk. It’s time for the city to take serious action. This means burying power lines in high-risk areas, enforcing hurricane-resistant building standards, upgrading stormwater systems, building robust flood barriers and seawalls, enhancing drainage with high-capacity pump stations, elevating critical facilities above flood levels, and equipping key facilities with backup power systems. If Houston can’t commit to these measures, we must invest in a secondary energy corridor city that will. Our country’s stability shouldn’t depend on Houston’s current level of investment"
[deleted]
"Will there be any kind of accountability for this? Any recourse for victims or for all the food and perishables lost? Multiple weeks without power in a first world country, in one of the world's wealthiest cities, after a 2-hour storm is unacceptable."
Thanks for pointing out the obvious.
"Good, we needed the rain, and people who WFH to go outside and do some actual work"
"Being that it’s trash day today, I got extra trash cans for free from the storm."
Still gotta go to work 😭 Thunder woke me up at 3am.
Paper plate blew away off my neighbor's Altima
Couldn't go back to sleep. Sleep damaged.
[We will rebuild](https://imgur.com/Jzbmf6z)
Neighbors house was hit by a lightning and the fire department was called as the house was on fire!
My trash bin tipped over. DEVASTATED
"The wind in spring was crazy 

[oak branch down ](https://imgur.com/a/Z65MGDi)"
"It’s crazy how the damage can vary so much, but my neighbor’s illegal trash dump made through the storm completely in tact."
Our fence of 20 years has gone to the great beyond
Computer apparently fried. Just heard a transformer across the street blow up.
"I swear every time a big storm blows over, I sleep through the entire thing and not even know it happened"
"Found out that my front door is clearly not sealed as well as it could be at the bottom due to the cuddle puddle that formed underneath it after waking up this morning.

Some neighborhood street flooding/standing water in Cypress area."
We lost our lavender plant.
"Heights had power, didn’t see a lot of debris on the ground on my way into the office. Just wet roads."
Just a few power blips and woke up to the thunder at 3 am.
It was crazy at like 2am-4am. Thankfully no damage that I could see. I was most worried about the roof but I walked around the house and it looks normal.
"Out NW near Willowbrook Mall, we're at 2.28"" through the gauge and that all fell between 3 and 4 AM.  Only 22 MPH gusts, power didn't even hiccup.  The thunder was really impressive.

We only had those super-loud explosive-sounding nearby strikes a few times, but the rumble of thunder was intense and constant.

No damage."
What storm? Slept through the night like a baby on benadryl
no power at the office (westchase)
"French doors decided to give us a vip front row experience to the wind and rain. 

And Firestone blew away."
"In cinco ranch, no power since this morning and waiting."
T1 🌪️ hit not far away from my place in Katy. Stores on Mason Rd just south of 10 have damage. See Jeff Linder on FB for pictures. My trash can tipped over. I’ll rebuild!
I was outside during the worst of it. [https://youtu.be/m6mv1tWj0FU?si=yvn6pRZ4hP8YFmcl](https://youtu.be/m6mv1tWj0FU?si=yvn6pRZ4hP8YFmcl)
We’re up in Klein and power has been out in our neighborhood since 3:30am. We have some stoplight issues but nothing else major so far.
Woke up to no internet
I have standing water in the street. Insane.
Driving in to work and seeing all the debris I feel like a freak for having slept through it all. Granted I was tired as hell and didn't get to bed until a bit after 1AM but still.
Our trash can fell over and spewed our trash across the street. Was almost late for work picking it up this morning. :/
I didn't even notice there was a storm last night. Next to Brays Bayou.
Lost power for four minutes. My back up generator kicked on so all good. Still no internet from Xfinity.
Been up since 3am. Couldn’t fall back asleep so I stayed up until a coffee shop opened then caffeinated.
Trash cans blew away
"It was absolutely insane out west of Katy, just south of I-10. Lightning looked like a strobe light through the blinds for over an hour. I think I got up and looked outside the front door right as the tornado was touching down a few miles away. There was a wall of sideways rain."
"Power is still out :(

Edit: Power came back not a minute after this comment was posted :)"
Did everyone wake up at 3am??? Seems like it
"Hedwig Village: Some branches down on the way in lots of debris and trash, too, as folks had their bins at the curb. Work south of U of H. Fallen tree had me reroute off Telephone, but otherwise fine."
Humble checking in. Lost power for about 45 minutes while we were sleeping. I assume the stuff in the fridge is fine.
"Had two small dogs panicking and climbing up in bed with me, so some lost sleep, but that's about it."
"Thunder woke me up at night. I'm tired today. My cat was terrified, but happy to be alive this morning.

Otherwise, nothing amiss that I could see immediately."
Cypress. Lost a lot of sleep but power remained on. I can usually sleep through a decent storm but this one kept me up!
Power was just restored at jones and cypress north Houston
My largest oak in my back yard got hit by lightning. Huge limb of the tree fell on our house. We attempted to minimize the rain coming in until it stopped. Pretty gnarly storm.
I wrecked on beltway 8 at 4:10am. The storm was so bad I hydroplaned into concrete barrier.. Harris county gave me a ticket also…failure to control speed. Sore and shaken up with a totaled truck.
Lost sleep
Wasn’t too bad. But creeped myself out checking the [security camera](https://youtu.be/l0B6bB497rg?si=nkN8fSt4DJWVO_NE) Sounded like someone was trying to open the back door. Decided to peer at the camera and each time the sky lit up it looked like there was a skin walker moving. Turns out it was just a tornado  I’m off of Mason and when I went to work this morning wondered if someone drove into the highway sign. Didn’t find it till much later.
"Honestly if I could just get an update from centerpoint, that would be great. Said they were taking longer than expected and reassessing a couple of hours ago and nothing heard since"
"North of Houston, here.

I stayed up all night waiting for a storm that scarcely made an appearance. Some thunder. Some lighting. Some rain. 

Counting our blessings no hail, no wind damage, and electricity never went out."
"Reporting from just north of Brookshire: we got about 20 minutes of really intense lightning, followed by probably 40 minutes of heavy-ass rain, followed by maybe 15 minutes of fairly strong wind out of the NW. No hail and nothing super nasty, power never went out.

Main consequence this morning is that there's a shitload of standing water. I should have mowed after work yesterday, now it's gonna be several days before it's dry enough for that."
my power has been out for hours now
I had a few flower pots blow over. I hope everyone survived better than me.
"I’m very glad I forgot to put out the trash last night. All the cans in my neighborhood are spilled over & garbage is everywhere. That’s about it in my part of Clear Lake. We usually have trees or branches down if someone just breathes heavy walking down the street but from what I could tell, the trees are all good."
"All I lost was sleep... Cats freaking the fuck out.. trying to get into the master bedroom. Meowing for 2 hours. And Ive had early meetings..  
  
I don't nap, but I will at noon."
Still no power. Out since 2:48am.
"Never lost power, only sleep from my dog and 5y/o feeling the need to lay on top of me to stay safe."
There were storms last night?
"give Texas Power & Construction LLC a call if you need your surge protector installed or outlets repaired for a good price

7139602904"
"Finally got power back around 11:30am. Other than that, just a few small limbs in the yard.

Taking a shower by flashlight was interesting."
The storms were no problem. What is the problem is the absolute shit ton of termites that have spawned and are swarming in and around my detached garage. There's clearly a full blown colony in there and I am freaking out waiting for an exterminator to get here and hit me with a massive quote for treatment.
My plants are over watered.
"We have SEVERAL ….several….palm fronds that have fallen. Everywhere. 

We will rebuild."
My sleep will never recover. And then all the traffic lights on my way to work were on the red blink so my entire day was ugh.
Your education was unfair to you. You fared poorly.
But does Katy need to evacuate?
I didn't even know we had a storm
There was a storm?
"I hope there's no airport delays, I'm thinking of going to Cancun."
My place is okay. I saw a lot of fallen trees/big branches on the road on the way to work.
"Some power lines are down, and we lost power for about five minutes. It's still intermittently pouring here though.

4/10/24 never forget"
"Historic Heights: there is a line of leaves in the street down on the corner, so I guess it flooded a bit."
"Bayous are 3/4 full, lots of small to medium branches down. Lights are flashing red on highway 6 just south of 290"
Lots of heavy banging that woke me but no damage around that I can see Montrose/River Oaks border.
All good here in the southeast
Lots of downed tree limbs in the clear lake area
All good here in Montrose. A few tree limbs down but that’s it.
"Slept through it, didn't know it happened until this morning"
We’re out of power till afternoon.
No power since 3am. No estimate for restoration.
"Plastic cover for the Tachus access point blew into the street

EDIT: shit, y’all, I am sorry. Some of you guys got it bad."
Kinda had my Bluetooth headphones on with ambient ocean waves coming along a beach to block out the thunder noises keeping me up. Did have a brief power outage before everything came back on.
My company lost internet. AT&T says it won’t be back for 24-48 hours. We are expected to work from home.
"Thunder and lightning. A few smaller branches down, but otherwise my house is fine.

Did discover that we lost a screw on the mailbox though, so the door was open and all the mail from last night's delivery was wet. Not sure if the wind caught it or it was just loose and finally gave up the ghost."
"It was noisy, windy, and rainy, but overall not bad in this area of Near Northside."
Lots of loud lightning/thunder and rain. Everything seems okay
No power at any gas stations in my area and due to high winds I couldn't get gas last night either (power kept flickering). Fingers crossed my lunch break goes better cause I've been on E since yesterday.
All good down here in pearland.
Couple downed branches no damage in seabrook
"Se side near Sagemonte./   Only thing that bothered me was I have a dog that thinks he is a bad ass but a little lightning and he cries like a little whiney bitch and wants to sleep across me. I use brown noise. I wouldnt have known it if it wasnt for my dog  

&#x200B;

Other than that A couple downed small limbs,.   Thats about it."
My sleep was deeply disturbed. Not sure who pissed off Zeus last night but I haven’t heard thunder and seen lightning like that be so damn intense in a while
"That firestone on Mason is gone... I've gone there for years. 

Parents' house doesn't have power."
Power is still out. Not a fun day.
"Not too bad in Humble, just flickers of power going out. But that storm was strong"
I gained an attic exhaust fan in my backyard.  Still not sure whose house it came off of.
"The fact that my power goes out for hours at a time every time there’s a storm is bullshit. It’s several times a year now. It didn’t use to be that bad at all. And I live on a power feeder that powers a school and a sewage treatment plant. They lose power with me now, too."
I was sleeping so good I didn't even hear it 💤
"I just cleaned my front door and security door now they are dirty again.  The fat squirrel who lives on my porch is still fat.

That is all."
my ladder fell over
"slept through it, no impact at all"
"I am out of town for work, but I was getting alerts non-stop thay there was movement in my house. It was the flashing of the lighting on the walls! Kinda wish I could have been there to see it!"
Rain slapped my windows like a pimp named slick back for a couple hours. We typically lose power to a light breeze but surprisingly all it did was flicker a few times.
There was a storm?
my dog had a full blown meltdown
Did it even rain? We had light rain in the evening but I didn’t know we had more storms overnight???
The wind took away my kerjiggers!
Collected some water ☹️☹️☹️Our water has been off since last Thursday
Shared fenced fell down
"Lost 1/3 of my fence, and a semi large tree limb."
Not too bad. Took the kids all of 15 minutes to pick and break up all the new twigs and sticks in the yard.
"Had to release what felt like number of gallons of water from my outdoor pond. 

Two clients in cypress lost power into the morning, one of them lost a large battery back up.

One client in Jersey Village was without internet until about an hour ago. Comcast had up to a few thousand reported outages."
Street I live on has old trees. It was trashed this morning. Lots of bumps while driving over limbs. There are still a ton of pinecones in the streets of the neighborhood.
Lightening struck so close to the house that it woke me up at 3am. Happened a few more times and couldn’t fall back to sleep so I stayed up watching tv. Was at the office 5 hours later downing coffee
"Gotta sat, moved to Ctrl TX from Houston about 4.5 yrs ago.  We don't have crao compared to Houston storms.  But we finally had one wirh z super hard rainfall yesterday.

Miss the  Houston area .  It will soon return to no rainfall here.  Kinda sucks..."
I have nothing. Seriously the dope fiend complex I'm trapped in received no damage and the dope fiends are just still running around like roaches. I hate this area. Fuckin Cleveland Conroe cut and shoot
I died
There was a storm? I guess I did fine then
No power since 3am in parts of Tanglewilde
Live in Houston very close to where this hit. Close to 1mil people without power and a rumor going around it could be out for weeks. 4 confirmed dead so far
"yeah. it’s a shit show in houston. especially my area in the loop. 

it seems like half the city is without power. i couldn’t make it more than about 1.5 miles from my house. lines are down everywhere. at least we have water. and booze."
"![gif](giphy|14pDS3FDDHZsyI)

A 2000s classic."
is there a name for feeling a mild sense of dread when looking at those towers?
I work for a large ISP on graveyards and every ticket I’ve worked tonight is from Houston area.  It’s going to be a shitty night.
"Over a 1M without power, most roads are impassable due to trees down, 4 people died during the storm

Edit: only most roads in certain suburban areas on the north side of town were impassable due to tree and power line damage. Thankfully crews and neighbors have cleared some areas overnight and this morning. It seems the wind damage was much worse in our area"
"I am one of those without power. Ill be fine, but it certainly sucks."
It was crazy. I was in the office in downtown and I swear I felt the building g shake a bit. I noped the fuck out of there. And we couldnt leave the parking garage since trees and glass from broken windows were blocking the exits and roads.
"I’ve lived here all my life and this one was intense and came out of nowhere. Half of a tree fell and totaled two of our cars and is blocking one lawn and driveway. 

I’m lucky we are okay, but I am stunned. We are so used to hurricanes and crazy weather, but this wasn’t even on the forecast as anything more than just a regular summer thunderstorm. I actually ignored the first phone siren for a tornando warning. The second one warning had me running downstairs and I saw rain blowing sideways and the tree come down."
r/ThatLookedExpensive
Visiting Houston for work rn. Watched the storm cause fuck it I'm in a hotel so if there's a tornado I'm just gonna die. For a solid 15 mins or so the top layer of clouds and the bottom layer of clouds were moving in two different directions. It was also crazy to see the birds leaving just before the rain started and looking like they couldn't control which way they were flying.
You must construct additional pylons
"been at no power for a while, don't think it's coming back anytime soon. goodbye fridge food 🥲

update: it's morning and still no power and my food is still in the fridge 👍

update: there are couple powerlines that got blown down, it definitely ain't coming back anytime soon in my area 🥲

update: according to Centerpoint it will most likely continue onto next week before the power comes back in my area. hopefully the food in the fridge will be OK but I'm throwing some stuff out. good times eh? 🥲

final update: power just came back not long ago, hope everyone will be too soon."
this image is terrifying
Raphael Cruz spotted heading to Cancun
Wtf I live in Houston and the worst thing that happened near me was some branches fell
The people who are going to suffer are not the one's who deserve it. 
Tbf the Texas energy grid always looks like that
# Houston just had a problem
Shit. Be safe everyone. Love from California
Good thing they have the federal government to fall back on!
"The privatised power companies are so fucked up in Texas, check this out:

The Texas electrical grid infrastructure is in such a bad state of repair than pretty much any unusual weather could result in a power outage.

Too cold? Power outage. Too hot? Power outage. Too windy? Power outage... etc. You get the idea.

Now, this is an issue for power companies. Every time there's an outage, they're losing millions. To stop outages, they'd have to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to fix the infrastructure, which they refuse to.

So guess what solution Texas governor Gregg Abbott came up with? He allowed the power companies to price gouge Texas residents to make up the loss caused by their own greed.

Currently, Abbott has given them the green light to charge up to $9,000 per megawatt hour, or 150 times the normal rate.

So if you live in Texas, this is why you electric bill blows up every time there's a power outage.

I honestly don't understand why there are people alive today who believe that privatisation is good for the community."
"This is the wildest thing. I'm here in Houston, and I just discovered that a very large tree in my backyard was dead (I'm disabled and live with my mom, who also has health issues, so we're not exactly in the yard often to check on these things) and I literally just had a tree service out today to quote me on a removal. They're going to be out tomorrow as they said that the tree is definitely a hazard, and then this weather comes through. We completely missed the worst of it, barely even grazed us, and the tree is fine. Feeling like we just dodged a bullet, like what are the odds."
Damn renewable energy failure causing that tower to fall...
Your Texas Governor now asking for Biden’s help.
Man that’s crazy looks like a 345 kv line down. Wonder how it’s going to effect the grid. Also curious if all the relays did their jobs and tripped out.
That'll buff right out.
"When we were told we would be getting some weather, I don’t think *this* is what they meant. I got multiple tornado warnings within a span of 5 minutes, which luckily I knew I could brush off since they never land near me, though there was one just down the road from me (the one a few weeks back on Mason Rd. in Katy)"
"What the heck, I literally had no idea it was this bad. I just was sleepin’ yall."
Never seen that before.
"So watched a news report on this.  Straight line winds started at about 80mph and intensified at up to 115mph before hitting downtown Houston at 105mph.  Possibly a tornado too, but certainly some very very strong winds."
"Any idea where in Houston that was from?
I'm in H-Town and still without power."
"That looks expensive. And because Texas refuses to connect their power grid to surrounding states, people will be without power for 10x longer."
"“I’m tired, Boss”"
Bruh TEXAS is the wildest when it comes to weathers(n more)
The home insurance industry is just screwed and now add Houston to the mix. Jeebus this gonna be bad
*Ted Cruz has exited the chat*
"Houston, we have a problem."
"In Florida, the people are the joke. In Texas, the Texas is the joke."
I think Greg Abbot should have to literally kiss President Biden's ass before we give Texas any help.
"Knowing the insane amount of power that goes thru those transmission lines, this pic was taken way too close"
Summer has not even started
The langoliers are coming
Ted Cruz is heading for Cancun again!
Bunch of idiots in here pretending somehow their states energy towers would withstand tornados lol
Every post about something bad happening in Texas has an absolute cesspool of a comment section nowdays.
"Good thing they have Greg Abbott!

He’ll pardon the weather and everything will be fine"
"I believe this happened in Cypress, TX. I used to live there, now I live on the north side. Still out of power as I write this."
"The Biden administration is standing by to offer federal assistance without any childish and idiotic political hate speech attached.

How awful!"
"Luckily they have their own power grid, so things should be up in no time. 💀"
Dayslong power outages if someone farts near transmission lines but women getting abortions is the problem?  Priorities.
"Interesting because these lattice towers are stress tested and rated for the wind speeds. Especially in Houston where it constantly gets hammered by storms. Curious to see if it was a material failure, human error or just freak accident. I build these for a living so genuinely curious."
I’m sure Ted Cruz is on top of getting this fixed lol
"Shout out to the those line men workers who wil be out there for countless hours on end to restore power.

Also Abott running to the government for assistance after giving that same government the middle finger is irony T its finest"
This was a severe storm it had nothing to do with the grid..chill with the jokes y'all people died. Edit alot of y'all need to touch grass as a liberal I am embarrassed by y'all's behavior celebrating natural disasters because it hurts Texas. I live here there are a lot of good people here just because our politicians are awful doesn't mean everyone here is also. And before someone says you need to vote them out or your state will never get better I have voted Democrat in every election sense I was of age to vote. I would leave If I could but I don't have any income. Edit Thanks for the reddit cares. I will treasure it always .
Daddy Joe please help us! We need you!!!
There’s a $17000 electric bill coming your way.
Here comes Abbot with his hat in his hands.
thankfully Governor Abbott has the power to free murderers. His power is on I'm guessing.
"2 comments. First, isn't this exactly what we would expect from Texas energy infrastructure in severe weather? Second, isn't this what the Eiffel Tower will look like if Paris keeps ignoring those expensive rust repairs?"
I thought hurricane season was over.
Houston may have a problem
wow. houston just had that flooding not long ago too.... im watching the coverage on it right now. I hope these people are ok. Hey houston if anyone is reading. reach out for resources. this is what we pay taxes for is to help others. never have too much pride for it pride is silly. i hope ur all ok.
"Good thing I’m not going to be gouged by the power company in my regulated power grid. - Nobody in Texas since 2002.

Looks like an extended holiday for Cruz is coming up this week. Republicans in power for last 30+ years and they will blame the democrats for this yet again."
Time for Texas to beg for that sweet sweet federal assistance.
I feel an increase in Houston’s electricity bill coming.
That looks expensive
"Luckily, the Saber tower plant is about 50 miles away."
Hey that's me! (That's less than 10 miles from my house) I currently have two trees on my roof and *can't do anything about it*
The Langoliers are coming
"Yeah… the storms here were pretty damn intense today. Just made it home before wind intensified quickly, I was sure a tornado was about to appear. 

I hope those without power will be okay."
"I was browsing Wunderground for my little city in Ontario and there was the word ""Houston"" up at the top with a little red triangle next to it, so I clicked that and it said ""TORNADO WATCH"" and I thought ""oh I bet I'll be seeing them on Reddit soon""."
Paris has fallen
"Houston, we have a problem"
"Ted Cruz booking another Cancun trip, I see."
"If only the world would pivot away from centralised power production, and went with adhocratic, decentralised solutions."
It's taking a nap!
"Jesus Christ ...

If something like that hit my country it would take forever and a day to fix ..."
Paris has fallen  O7
Well sending hope and prayers Texas……. Anyways!
Looks like there wont be any electricity for a month for those people over there.
That’s just the tilt of the Earths surface.
Seems Houston’s having a problem
The bottom fell off.
Oh please it's not that severe. It only took down one enormous electrical tower./s
Get ready to have your electric bill go up to pay for the repairs. Looks like a war zone!
"""Houston, we have a problem"""
"Freedom Grid gonna’ shank TF outta people. 

“Surge Pricing”"
"Im sure they'll be begging the government for disaster aid just as soon as they get done bad mouthing them, here in Oklahoma they do the same shit."
No worries.  Our reliable nation power grid will ensure redundancy.
"Damn

And considering the last few years that electrical grid is held together with duct tape and popsicle sticks already"
I bet abbott fists the citizens of Texas again with his response
"Holy shit, hopefully everyone has their generator gased up. 

Did any hospitals lose power?

Suddenly all of those off the grid rooftop solar people aren’t looking so crazy now."
Go go Godzilla
Looks like repair work for the fine people of ERCOT
It was the Langoliers
I can hear Joe Rogan now…
"Oh no, not the Texans power grid!!

It was already on life support."
"Dude, Houston has all my love and all my awful memories of grid failure. Too many hurricanes. No thank you."
No federal funds. Fix it on your own.
Their power doesn’t work anyhow
"Thoughts and prayers and bootstraps, right?"
Gotta keep praying.
Queue calls for federal help by Texan governor.
But the Laser doesn’t burn blue objects!
But the Laser doesn’t burn blue objects!
Good thing the governor has it under control!
Another ERCOT failure?
Thanks Obama! /s
The storms will only get worse. How much worse depends on what we do about climate change.
"In other news, the Texas Power Consortium reports a 100% increase in fees for all customers, because why not, we can do that."
Ah it must be the damn windmills again.
"Bad weather, shit broke? Gods revenge for ( insert some bullshit) right?!! Republicans answer for this when it happens in a blue city."
I think Houston have a problem
Oh jeepers that looks bad
Why do I feel like o can hear this gif
Wish I could say I’m sorry
The video where it goes from day to almost pitch black is insane
And their energy infrastructure had a failure?! That doesn’t sound like Texas. /s
Houston we have a problem
That's that privatized power grid we know and love in Texas. Built to withstand beautiful sunny days....
And Texas being the state that it is run by the party who runs it and chaired… by the governor who “governs” there I’m sure will get right on fixing the grid.   They would never let people freeze or boil to death due to lack of means of heating/cooling or being able to cook food.
"The irony is that the red states will likely suffer the most from weather events, and their insurance costs will rise a lot. It’s not just extreme weather, but also the death by a thousand cuts from more frequent “regular” events"
Houston gets dumped on for real. Extremely hot. Insane rainfalls. Extremely cold.
"oh jesus, given the state of the infrastructure of texas' ""independent"" power grid, i'm guessing this is going to be a clusterfuck for a long time. anyone on the ""ted cruz fleeing to mexico again"" watch?"
"I'm sure the power infrastructure is handling this like a champ... 

/s"
Power line tired. Power line sleep.
Don't worry. I'm sure the famously robust and durable Texas energy grid will be able to cope /s.
...when infrastructure is policed by the same private corporations that build the infrastructure.  Standards are thrown to the wayside for higher profit margins...but don't worry!  Abbot already asked Biden for federal tax money to clean up his mess!
Still want to secede?
Holy hell the videos: https://weather.com/news/weather/video/texas-town-flooded-as-storm-system-drenches-the-region
Awesome! I fucking hate Texass anyway. Hope it cost No Legs Abbott a ton of money.
Texas Infrastructure makes India look like Cybertron
Just pick yourselves up by your bootstraps.
"Oh that Texas grid, always joking around!"
"ok, haven't seen it in the comments so i have to add:
Houston, we have a problem"
"![gif](giphy|gLiJPmz9H6SKF0yfdX|downsized)

Thank goodness we have Joel Osteen to help all those people!!!"
Crazy... Texas is known for its robust and efficient power grid.
Looks like God punishing them
"I'm guessing Gov. Abbott has wasted no time asking for federal assistance. Sorry to exploit a tragedy, but if so it should come only on the condition that Texas agrees to join the rest of the nation's power grid. Getting their private system bailed out over and over again has to stop."
"Anyone else starting to feel like federal relief dollars to Texas need to come with a legal agreement by the state to upgrade their infrastructure and beef up safety regulations to protect its citizens from the bi-yearly energy issues?

Stay safe Houston."
"Where's Ted Cruz? 

Still in NY making speeches outside Trump's trial? Or has he booked his vacation flight already?"
Texas doesn't want to connect to the rest of the US grid.  lol
I would've thought Godzilla stopped by for a visit.
"Shite...we moan about the wind here in Britain, but..."
"It’s just taking a nap, it will sit straight up once it’s finished"
Abbot did say Texas has the best grid system…. Just a huff and Puff it’s down for the count. Feel sorry for those who will power for a significant period of time.
"I sad that political grandstanding to protect private profits prevented Texas from integrating with the national power grid, having more redundancy in capacity and ability to spread power could ameliorate some of the power concerns at least? that is what I think of when I see a high energy powerline tower go down like this."
I thought I saw Ted Cruz at the airport.
Imagine if Texas actually seceded from the union.
"Time for Texas to start begging for that sweet, sweet federal aid all of a sudden"
Those are going to take a while to fix. A storm knocking those over is no joke.
I was stuck in my car for the whole thing. Was insane seeing the wind pick up from 0 to 100 and trees start flying and the signs shaking and the power going out all in the span of about 4 seconds.
Those towers are supposed to be bomb proof. I guess they need to start designing for bigger bombs.
Holy shit iron lady down
Is GOD sending Gregg Abbott a message to stop being an asshole?
"Noooo, the I-Fell tower!"
Guess Ted will be in Cancun for the foreseeable future
as an electrical engineer I can inform you that they're not supposed to do that.
Houston is starting to have problem after problem and it's not even hurricane season yet.
Why would renewable energy do this
Good thing Texas' power grid isn't connected anywhere outside the state so that no other states will be affected by the power failures.
Uhh Houston? We got a problem...
"Something something bootstraps. 

Something something self-sufficient. 

Something something not relying on the federal government."
"Has anyone said:

“Houston, we have a problem”,

Yet?"
It’s a good thing Texas didn’t cut themselves off from any national power grid or anything.
"Sounds like Ted Cruz is headed to Cancun!

![gif](giphy|l4pTmBQTSnfEv7nQk|downsized)"
"Quick, remove the words ""severe weather"" from legislation too. It'll be ok then."
"Texas: WE ARE GONNA SECEDE!

Texas (every time stuff like this happens): Hey Uncle Sam! Send money."
"Houston, you have a problem!"
Looks like Greg Abbott’s spine.
These severe weather events will become more and more common and Texas Republicans will keep pretending climate change is a conspiracy.
Too bad their governor is more concerned with pardoning murderers as opposed to the faulty electrical grid. https://www.nbcnews.com/video/houston-skyscrapers-damaged-in-severe-storms-211108421802
"Houston, you have a problem"
Not sure if this weather is actually severe or the infrastructure is just shit cuz the weather changes to anything unusual and then suddenly yall have no power everytime
Oh no! It's a good thing they are part of a robust multi-state grid that can handle the outage.... oh wait...
No doubt those independent bad asses will have this fixed up in no time! All by themselves. No crying to big daddy fed for the stalwart people of Texas.
Another example of Texas not being prepared for disaster. Y'all need to vote differently...
I heard Abbott asked Joe Biden for some federal help for Texas. I say thoughts and prayers for all those Texans. They elected that p.o.s. To be their leader.
They can just jack up the energy costs and never fix it.
"God punishing the people of Texas for being too woke, I guess. 

Yes, sarcasm."
"Thoughts and prayers, let them get their freedom grid back up without any of that horrible, obscene, no-good federal government money!"
How will Texas blame renewable energy for this?
![gif](giphy|BW03h8SCdT3HxvDs9d|downsized)
I've run out of sympathy for Texas and Florida.
Abbott about to beg Biden for FEMA assistance in 3...2...1...
And the governor who can’t govern has the audacity to ask the federal government which he maligns daily for help. Pound sand
God must really hate Texas
Time to go begging for handouts from Daddy Biden. So brave and independent until nature acts on them or their poorly designed infrastructure collapses. Remember how Republicans voted against bills that would help all these problems? I do.
Sending prayers to the people of Paris 😞🙏
Houston shouldn’t exist as a city. Mother Earth is fighting back and punishing its oil industry
"Texas prepared ? Laughable, totally laughable. They are way too busy with petty bullshit to be prepared for anything. Half of them begging to secede from the US. Yet who ya gonna call when the shit hits ? Joe Biden that’s who, we hate the federal government, but come bail out asses out will ya Joe ?  Greg is finding out that Mother Nature don’t play. Climate change, fuck that. We’ll vote against that shit every time. Greg ? Call up Ted Cruz if he’s not on vacation, maybe he can fix it. If he’s not got Donald’s dick down his throat."
Are you sure swangers didn't clip them?
Good thing you guys have an independent energy grid!
Chalk this up in the “reasons to never go to Texas” column

"In my area it look like nothing happen, then went to work and holy shit, all the light are off and had to go the other way to get into work due to thick branches blocking one of the entrance. Bunch of things got blown away."
Was this a tornado or just wind? I can’t imagine the type of wind knocks down that type of tower
Is this how lamp posts are made?!..
FRANCE HAS FALLEN. THE EIFFEL TOWER  IS DESTROYED
Seems like an understatement.
what a disaster mate
"Not one, “Houston we have a problem” joke?"
"Was it a tornado? Here in NZ we get frequent crazy winds, but infrequent tornadoes... and noone's ever heard of one of these towers falling over."
That bad huh
Ouch!

The eiffel tower 😭😭
Talk about some wind holy shit
"is that the awfull tower, do you live in france? JK (eat everything in the fridge first if you have a deep freeze open it as little as possible and insulate it  with whatever you have we put all the patio cushions on the freezer and it lasted a week  this is not going to be a quick fix ? a gas BBQ  an extension cord kind neighbors will go a long way good luck !

How long will this take to get fixed?
t’s going to get hot real quick without power.
"Things gets worst as some apparently doesn’t know how to negotiate a non-functioning traffic light, just saw a truck bro blown right through a cross road without a care."
Pretty sure a tower like that should not do that.
Paris has fallen
"Is it not common out there to have solar panels on residential roofs and battery systems so that when grid dies at least the houses can be self sufficient? Even diesel diesel genny's?

For places where the grid is so delicate and where there's loads of sunshine it seems quite odd residential solar isn't embraced."
"Holy crap, those are some crazy high voltage lines, hope they shut it down pretty quick."
We lost power for like 6 hours after some storms rolled through. I can't imagine a few days to weeks. At that point anarchy is very possible 😆
Is the top supposed to fall off?
Whoops
the langoliers are coming
Or Godzilla. Take your pick.
Oh shit. I literally *just* flew out of Houston yesterday. Seems like missed this by an inch.
Just pick it back up

"anyone planning to move to texas or has recently, lol

what will they deregulate or oppress next"
God speed emergency services and electrical linesman.
"Oh no, the eiffel tower fell"
It's almost like they bought the cheapest flimsiest pylons instead of investing in good solid infrastructure.
Oooooooh creepyyyyy!!!!
"Just let it sleep, had a rough day"
Major skill issue 🤣
I used to be a Lineman for Centerpoint Energy in the Bellaire service area. This image gives me chills. Start looking for generators or plan to go live somewhere else for a while if your power is out.
The pylon’s just sleepy
[MegaEngineering: Dome Over Houston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdSG1Cxxa4)
"We had a transmission tower fall during Ida. The tower for the transmission wires crossed the Mississippi, they switched and isolated the collapse and restored power pretty quickly.

Hopefully you all get power back soon. Hope everyone is ok."
I'll just have a little lie down
What are you doing step tower
Paris has fallen
"Since Allison, dad bought a $600 genny that would go well over $3k in today’s market.  It powers our fridge, deep freezer, a window AC unit and still room for another fridge from my sister house next door. 

My dad in his final years wanted to sell that lovely generator. Every time, I would yell at him saying that damn thing has seen us through the toughest of times in Houston and don’t even think of selling it. I said I will still use it after he died to help his grandchildren and his great grandchildren who needs it in these situations. 

That damn genny is happily humming right now while I type this in the dark. 

TL;DR. BUY A GENERATOR. KEEP IT WELL MAINTAINED."
That tower is drunk
"I spent 15 years working on those types of structures. Watching it on the evening news here in New Zealand, and seeing the tower and substation structures getting whackfucked, I felt a deep sense of compassion and sympathy for the poor motherfuckers that will be fixing this shit up. It's a cnt of a job even on a good day. Go hard lads/ladies, and keep a good eye out for those odd partial collapse loads."
Holy crap. I own a house in Houston but work out of town and my mates were telling me how nuts the weather was. Fuckin al. Mother Nature pissed at us
How long before they consider their aging infrastructure to be a risk to the citizens?
"Nature, chill. Suprise Attack September is in four months!"
There's some good lines in these comments under the bad ones.
Such a low tension picture
NOO NOT PARIS!!1!
"I heard transmission towers were down after I lost power, but hadn't seen it. That's a big yikes to see one of those collapsed."
"I have family who live about an hour and a half away. I have weather notifications turned on, on my iPhone. It’s become a joke at this point, that every time anything happens in Texas, I text my dad (usually sending a screenshot with it) and say, “In case you didn’t know… it’s raining/flooding/there’s a tornado/thunderstorm in Vidor…” He thinks it’s hilarious. "
"I drive past towers like these every day, thinking about the weather conditions required to bring one down like that is terrifying. Do we know if maybe maintenance was lax or any reason why it collapsed, or was the weather just **that** bad?"
SEVEREEEEEEE?????

Yet it seems like every day there are news about grids failing, bridges collapsing, highways being fucked, roads washing out, water and sewage systems giving up, trains derailing.


USA...  you OK? Do you like... need help? Nothing wrong with calling your parents in the old world to give a hand at times of need."
Good job Texas has such an advanced and reliable power grid. This won't even be an issue.
paris has fallen :( …

"It's either caused by the imaginary global climate change, the Biden administration or God is pissed off at all the evil being done in his name by far right Christian fascists there.

Either way, I do hope that everyone is OK. I've seen first hand the destruction from severe storms and typhoons."

Texas power grid couldn't handle a storm? Shocking.
Wow
That's not good..... you can't put those back up in any kind of hurry.  If a 69kv line goes down they usually can feed an area from another source. This line is at least a 345kv I'd say and those fed multiple 69-215kv systems... so basically your fucked lol.

"My home was in the center of the storm for a bit there, it was pretty crazy. One minute it was partially cloudy, no rain, just not the nicest day. Then me and my boyfriend got two tornado warnings on our phones back to back and not even 2-3 minutes after that the wind was crazy and it was raining, hard. 

At one point the giant tree in front of my house was getting pulled by the wind. The branches were all twisting and swinging upwards while rain slammed into the window horizontally, pelting it with leaves. We got lucky only a few branches came down, and even then, no significant damage. 

My thoughts and well wishes to those struck harder than we were. Hopefully everything gets cleaned up ASAP!"

How many millions are going to be out of power for a month just so rich utility companies can be unregulated and price gouge every storm. Texas did this to themselves. 
"This happened in Australia about 5 years ago. Massive down draft crumpled a 500kv tower.

South Australia lost power for a few minutes, the line was reinstated in a couple of months, and still people complained bloody murder."

Ugh. That’s not an easy fix and represents a significant artery for many power customers/people.

It a good thing Texas is connected to the rest of the country's power grid as a back up /s
And now they will beg for federal money......

Don’t worry. Abbott has got you. Just a couple moths of no power and you’ll be back to normal.

"So much freedom, I am jealous"
Pity Texas can’t go 12 months without some severe energy related issue. If only there were 2 grids they could connect to to help with their power issues….
Horrible. I hope the people get the support they need. Texans might be selfish assholes that don’t vote to support their neighbors but we’ll still support them. Because that’s what it means to be a citizen and a patriot. It means you do the right thing even when it sucks
Seems like texas is always having issues with their power grid. Oh wait…they refuse to get on the national grid. Oh well
Lol Texas
So you're saying Houston has a problem??
Fk Texas. Backwards ass state.

(I have loved ones in Texas, my heart is with you <3)"
"-Puts on tin foil hat-
Thanks Obama!!"
Severe weather seems so much more prevalent this year. Like why is the weather going buck wild
"I was pretty well on the fringe of it, and the sky went dark green-purple for a solid 45 minutes. 

Truly scary downpour, and I've lived here all my life. I hope those in the effected area are okay and Abbott doesn't continue to fuck us over."
"My thoughts and prayers are with them! 

We are so lucky that God decided to land this storm in Texas where they don't need anyone's help and do everything on their own."
"Oh look, Texas lost power again, anyway..."
I imagine most Texans line up their gun collection and empty rounds into the weather to stop it in their tracks
"Looks like Texas is about to ask for federal aid, again. Talk a big game."
Timber!
"I blame wind turbines.

/s"
Oh no! Anyway....
"Man, their god must really not be happy with how they’ve been acting lately"
“Thoughts and prayers” and don’t you dare ask for any socialist handouts Texas.
Good thing Texas doesn't believe in human driven climate change.
Jesus is punishing texans for their idiot fuckery. Happily. Someone has to.
I think this was God telling all those libs not to build electric cars in Texas. Maybe he has a better idea
We have a problem
"Houston, you have a problem."
"""Houston, we have a pro- oh, never mind, seems you got a lot on your plate already!"""
Right to work states in a nutshell
God Texas sucks ass at infrastructure. Is it that hard? Too busy spending money on razor wire and LEOs at the border to care I guess.
Obviously pre-rapture weather patterns.
Independent grid problems
"Did Abbott try to bomb the weather?  Maybe that’d stop it?  

I hope not too many people died in this."
Langoleirs.
So… Houston has a problem?

Mr Greg Abbott can beg Biden for help
"Houston, we have a problem"
Houston we have a problem
"Houston, you have a problem"
ercot budget line burying.  trench and tnt
I hope ERCOT has a huge crew. Remember during the freezing weather a few years ago when Texas refused help with power? Texas has its own power grid.

Houston had a problem
Houston we have a problem
Texas power grid after a slight inconvenience:
Is texas outsourcing infrastructure labor and management to china? What do they have against building shit that doesnt fall down in an average gust of wind?
Is this literally a Houston we have a problem?
"Houston, we have a problem."
Global warming is a lie /s
"Seems like their shoddy infrastructure and choices had the ""severe reaction"" to natural weather. Good thing they are so independent, they will help and change themselves with money to spare for other states! Right? Right???"
Karma
I hear that their governor is gonna do jack shit. Good luck
"Houston, we have a problem"
Houston we have a problem…
Uhm… Houston………..
"Houston, you have a problem"
This time Houston has a problem.
.... we have a problem
"Well, thank god they weren’t windmills."
Maybe it was god
Nah the power grid in Texas always looks like that . Hey Greg buddy … maybe you can get that MURDERER you just set free to fix that shit . Don’t call for help TRAITOR !
"Houston, we have a problem"
Piss boy governor needs feds help now. He’s such a piss boi
Seed the clouds sum more dick bag government
Texas Governor: Why would windmills do this!?!
We may have a problem
I blame renewable energy. /s
Houston we have a problem
I’m pretty sure this is because of Texas’ woke reliance on renewables.
"Houston, we have a problem"
Hope everything better soon
"Houston, we have a problem"
Shame it didn't fall on Giant Piss-Baby Greg Abbott and finish the job the tree started.

That’s God’s wrath Texas had it coming

Contingency plans? Nah. Just put up signs everywhere saying 'Don't mess with Texas'.

Seems like Houston has a problem.
...Due to Climate Change.  Fixed the title for you.
"Houston, you have a problem."
Huston has a very big problem me thinks
![gif](giphy|PrEUkNFD9pN2o|downsized)
Guarantee the voters don't care
Wind farms be flying tho. Should be cheap electricity this month.
Abbott going to have to get on his knees again and beg the blue states for help that he believes no one deserves.  Effing hypocrite
If I were a religious person i'd say this is god punishing Texas...
My god I’d never live in Texas.
Why the fuck do people even live in texas? Their infrastructure can't seem to handle a single goddamn thing.
"How long will Texas continue its little horse and pony show while millions don’t have power until they connect themselves to the fucking grid like a normal state.   
Must be the sun roasting these peoples brains…"
"So will the ""independent nation of Texas"" be asking the rest of the United States for financial assistance?"
Damn them tesla coils and free universal power don’t seem too bad now huh
Not one dime of federal money for TX.
Time for Ted Cruz to go on vacation again!!
"Man, sure seems like we should have spent some more money on US infrastructure over the last few decades, huh?"
Texans: “Look at what Biden did!“ /s
"Abbot to Biden: I hate you, you scum but please,please please help us out.

Please?"
greg abbott and ted cruz heading to cancun as we speak !
I’m sure Biden will hold something over Greg Abbott’s head before agreeing to provide federal aid to help deal with the storm aftermsth. LOL just kidding. What kind of piece of shit president would do that? 🤣
"MORE GUNS, NEED MORE GUNS, PLEASE SEND GUNS, LOTS AND LOTS OF GUNS....BIG GUNS , LITTLE GUNS, WE LOVE ALL GUNS !!!!GUNSGUNSGUNSGUNSGUNSGUNSGUNSGUNSGUGUNSGUNSGUNSGUNSGUNSGUNSGUNSGUNSGUNSGUNSGUNSGUNSGUNSGUNS"
lol - it’s Texas.  IDGAF.
"More like ‘Houston, we have a problem’ amirite?"
Good thing they all have bootstraps.
This is art.
Too bad their governor couldn't care less
Reap what you sow.
"apollo 13, we have a problem"
"Houston, we have a problem."
Omg someone make sure Ted is safe in Mexico
Is Greg about there helping people? Oh wait.
Texas can’t catch a break.
RIP reasonable electricity bills
Paris has fallen!
Paris has fallen
As a California whoses never been in weather like this ever before looks like a light storm
My heart goes out to France. RIP Eiffel Tower
"Go ahead, seperate from the rest of us, do it, cowards."
And is begging Biden for aid while continuing to call the government crooked and illegitimate.
send lawyers guns and money
Poor French people gotta build a new eiffel tower.
Even the power lines are created with dry wall over there?
Ted Cruz seen boarding plane to Cancun
"The energy state is not in a good state, is it?"
Climate change ain’t real and too bad Trump is on trial or he could come and throw paper towels like party favors.
Don’t worry Ted Cruz will blame Hamas and send Israel more billions of dollars for their infrastructures
Damn. And they're still on their own power grid. Not good.
Your fault
"ERCOT Freedom Grid\*

\*Not for use in inclement weather, the heat, or the cold."
They got bootstraps! Use em
Because of communism?
Get fucked Texas. Hopefully this motivates you people to get rid of the ones that are sabotaging your power system
Climate change?
Is it global warming or is it all the particulate matter they are spraying in the sky? The weather in NY has been mystifying in the last few years
Surely the governor of Texas can just send the storms somewhere else? He's so good at governing.
Gee. I hope the whole state doesn’t get leveled due to bad karma
Fuck Texas
"The more stuff that goes bad for Texas the more I think god hates them for their blasphemy, claiming their hatred I his name. Makes you wonder."
It's alright Texas is connected to the national power grid.  All should be fine..
Biden did that
Damn wind turbines blew it down!
"Houston, we have a problem"
"Houston, we have a problem"
Lol
"Houston, we have a problem!"
"Houston, we have a problem"
Ted Cruz will want a congressional hearing as to why the libs have control over the weather. You can call him in Cancun with updates.
Looks like it cleaned Houston up a bit
100 bucks Ted Cruz already 'has' an upcoming vacation planned.
Houston we have a problem
So it's Houston that has the problem now..............
"It’s probably because of Biden and the Gays. /s, but seriously, even though it’s Texas I do genuinely hope people come out of this ok and they get infrastructure up and running quick."
Houston… we have a problem
THE POWER TOWER IS GIVING HEAD!!!!!
"Genuinely wondering, what did the government do to improve the power grid since a few years ago during the ice storms?"
"Gov. Abbot likes to make a stink about not following certain federal laws he disagrees with, then comes begging for money from the federal government."
"If only we had built that wall, and nuked that one troublesome hurricane. Storms would be too scared to illegally migrate here."
"What’s that again, low taxes?"
Huston we have a problem
Texas’s infrastructure is comical
"""Houston, we have a problem"""
"“Please help President Biden, Sir”

-Abbot"
Could you imagine if Texas was its own country? It would be worse than this.
Houston isn't meant to handle the population and concrete it has. It's essentially a shallow swamp. This shit happens every year basically. It's sad. Feel bad for those who paid the ultimate price.
Hmmm… Surely the free market will take care of this!
"If I was religious, I would claim it is gods punishmend for Texas having Abbott, Cruz and the other evil monsters"
"Ah, the independent Texas power grid in its best shape."
Maybe the pardoned self-described racist murderer can help out with the repairs.

"How much do we have to spend bailing out this failed state this time?

I’m sure they will hold their Republican leader responsible this time, /s"
FrEEdoM! wElCOme tO TeXas!
"Sounds like God is angry and is punishing Texas. That’s how this works, right?"
Time to pull up those boot straps
"Man, but y’all’s state is just going to hell in a hand basket, isn’t it?"
"Why is it every time Texas weathers, they lose power?"
Greg Abbott wont do shit about this
"What kills me is that the last time I had a blackout (San Francisco bay area) was pre COVID I think. And it was a massive wildfire that caused it.

The mockery from republicans was insane. For a totally freak event.

Texas seems to be the blackout state these days. Guess all us liberals should be making fun of Texas any minute now.

  
Strange that i don't seem to be seeing anything.

/s"
THANKS BIDEN
"I don't understand, why don't other cities simply build an arch to deflect severe weather?"
Bootstraps! Etc etc
"Gov Abbott: PWEEESE Mr Federal government, can we have billions in tax dollars to fix our privately owned infrastructure that we refuse to hook up to the national grid that fails multiple times a year?"
"Too bad their power companies decided to opt out of federal regulations and standards that would have prevented this tragedy in the first place, AND provided power from multiple points from the NATIONAL power grid so that Texans did not suffer without the texas government preventing it. 

Go ask Governor Abbot for generators, and vote accordingly upon his next election.


EDIT:        
LOL, down votes from abbot dick suckers, what a total surprise!"
[removed]
Why is it when I think oh its texas do I think well ok they deserve it when i live in this fucking state? South of houston is all white and all rich. Think Nolan Ryan rich.
"Their exact words were ""CenterPoint now expects to have 1 million impacted customers restored by the end of the day on Wednesday, July 10.""

Since over 2 million of their customers lost power that is less than half fixed by the end of the 10th."
"I feel you dawg! I’m going to start saving at least $5,000 yearly to evacuate to another state. Losing power is one of my biggest pet peeves"
I'm looking to move soon.  One sneeze and the power is out for a week.  Lose all groceries AGAIN.  4TH Largest city in America with the power grid of a 3rd world country.  It's embarrassing at this point.  I'm over it.
"Where the hell are all of our taxes dollars going? We voted for increased tax for flood mitigation years ago… nothing. Taxes and higher power rates to improve our electric grid and infrastructure… nothing. 

We are paying the money to fix the issues and nothing is being done."
"Born and raised in Houston, but I left after Harvey. These floods and hurricanes are gonna keep happening more and more frequently until it's just another summer day."
"There's a certain cultural apathy in Houston that I really fucking hate, even though it's partially a consequence of a laid-back attitude that I love. It impacts a lot of areas of life, and we really pay for it at times like this. I keep hoping for more civic engagement, more *community*, but I just don't know."
I feel the same way. Been here about 15 years now and its just getting worse.
Houstonians feeling the exhaustion of being 'Houston strong' all the time.
"Thanks Abbott.Billions on the border ,all for show,but  refuses to fix the grid.All so his energy company co contributors can keep fleecing consumers in time of weather related calamity"
"After living and loving this city for almost 50 yrs am done this time. WE are planning to move . Incredible a modern American city is so mishandled and the power companies so ill prepared. 

Also there is absolutely NO WAy this city could be evacuated if need be, just look at constant everyday traffic...."
"I love Houston and I miss it, but this is the #1 reason we got the \*\*\*\* out!!  Lived there 16 years but after the freeze and multiple storms, we had enough!  I feel for everyone.. i bet there's more big storms on the way this year."
"The reality is that the rural voters outnumber the urban ones who care about these things. At a state level, the government just doesn’t care either, since they were voted in by people who want to stick it to the cities. It’s an interesting flex though, considering that Houston drives much of the Texas economy and every time we sneeze gas prices go up across the nation. But since the rich can leave whenever they’re inconvenienced and their rural base will still vote for them, why should they care?"
"Houston is just not a pleasant or well-managed place right now. Incompetent leadership and corporate greed, combined with climate change, has turned it into a third world country when storms come."
"It's the same bullshit year after year. 

State/county/city government/local utilities do the bare minimum to prepare; Disaster happens where people have to suffer in boiling heat, floods, or freeze;  Officials go on TV and suck each other's dicks about how hard everybody is working and come up with a catchy slogan; If anybody complains they are shouted down."
"When Texans stop voting Republicans into offices. Hard truth. If you're a conservative voter your values are unironically irrelevant because republican politicians have zero policy positions, they dont actually govern outside of ""muh tax cuts"" and all the other weird shit like getting Commandments and bibles in classrooms."
"I haven’t seen any party with a decent plan to make infrastructure more climate resilient. It doesn’t have to be big and bold. Gimme competence and I’ll vote for it.

Republicans have become a joke."
"I’m only here because of family members I help, if not, I would be gone from this STATE! Almost 30 years, I’m beyond fucking tired and these storms are going to get more frequent and more intense. This city and infrastructure is not even being close to being ready. People can keep moving here in droves, I’m out of here the first chance I can leave, I’m tired. I’ve been saving money up for years to make sure I do it right. "
I understand all the hate Houston gets from other Texas cities. We are so fucking primitive. I'm sick of it.
"The last 4 disasters, maybe more, that I can remember, there were always 1M+ people who didn't have power.  We are batting 1,000 at the moment.  

Comes November, vote all the incumbents out.  Don't care about which political party."
"While our loser corporate monkey governor is in Asia, I love our city, hate our stupid government. Centerpoint is a freaking mafia that just cares about money and theres nothing we can do bc the idiots in small towns only care about ""conservative values"" and keeping Texas red, while Abbott sits on his high horse with his scamming croney bald b\*tch(Ken Paxton). God I hate them all, they dont care about us!!! There are no down power lines but somehow half our complex doesn't have electricity and its damn near impossible to even get an update. I remember growing up and going through worse storms and it never was this big of an issue."
I adore Texas but our power grid is a joke. I’m honestly surprised there aren’t more riots at government offices
The State hates the City of Houston. Just look at the news. It’s as if the State punishes Houston and its citizens actively. I’ve never lived in a city where officials hate their own citizens. Why is it like this!?
"I wonder if voters could make it illegal for power companies to have any charges on the bill other than usage charges.

They might change their mind about grid maintenance and durability if they are making no money when the power is out."
"Welcome to a deregulated energy market. Some regulation is a good thing. Enforcing that gas lines be properly winterized or that transmission towers are structurally sound enough to not be blown over by 50-60MPH winds are smart things that would stop a lot of issues like this. However, they cost money, and given the choice of spending money to cover edge cases or not spending money and YOLO'ing every time something like this happens, companies will choose saving the money every time. They have to be forced to do the right thing, so it's simply the cost of doing business."
When people start voting for it! As long as Republicans have total control of the state nothing is ever going to change… and in reality will probably continue to get worse.
"When dumb fucks stop voting the good ol boys into office, it'll change.


Narrator: ""it won't change"""
People don’t want to admit it but this city is going downhill.
I am super excited to try out my new state insurance with the 2% deductible!!! I am positive my $5K a year homeowners insurance will come through for us and not increase next year! (Sarcasm)
"Big Bad Texas, huh?  Enough with the bravado.  I just got back from Mexico and weathered the CAT2 strength of Beryl and didn’t go more than 3 minutes without power.  This place is acting like it got hit with CAT9 Katrina+.

What an embarrassment of a state.  A Canadien named Ted as our senator.  Third world country infrastructure across the state.  Don’t get me started on this state acting like it’s 1899.  Republican leadership for decades, and this is what we get and deserve.

But by all means, let’s vote for Abbott for 20 more years.  Let’s get Trump back into the White House.  We have to be the dumbest smart people of the face of this Earth—until project 2025 privatizes education and it becomes a privilege to get a 3rd grade education."
If urban Harris county voters outnumbered rural votes along with texas in general voting further to the left we’d see change. However lived here many years my vote just get erased by a brain rotting voter who thinks voting to the left is voting for a communist or voting for the devil. Then the same conservatives who are in the pockets of center point and other energy companies just get voted in. Sad reality of Texas.
"It's coping. I just learned it's all fucking coping. The grind mindset, staying strong, denial. It's been around for a long time because there's no other way to keep going other than to cope. So we developed evolutionary complacency to accept instead of change."
"My area, zero elec, zero internet, and zero FUCKING CELL PHONE SERVICE!! I didn't even know that was a thing. I can't even make 911 calls. It's BULLSHIT how unprepared this city is."
"Almost feels like a 2nd world country with an unstable power grid and infrastructure.

Downtown has electricity underground and they don't go out. Who's in those buildings during hurricanes anyway?

Why is there SO much backlash about building our infrastructure safer underground? You'll hear arguments ""but marshland and it's wet!"" yet other countries with nearly identical geography are doing it just fine."
"We need another Governor, one who will hold ERCOT accountable. Abbott makes too many deals with the devil. He will put businesses ahead of his constituents every. single. time.  He needs to go, period."
"Blame Texas, not the city. Our state government is actively hostile towards progress or any kind."
"same. ive lived here for so long and its only getting worse... im ready to abandon ship. I love Houston i love its diversity and its food and its culture and arts scene, but the infrastructure is literally killing us.. its not just houston though.. its this whole damn state.."
Remember this when it is time to vote
"70+ mph wins are hardly a slight out of wack.  If you had driven around Houston just after, stuff all over the place was knocked over.   Traffic lights were smashed up all over just from getting peppered with debris."
"""Houston Strong"" (Because Texas didn't invest in infrastructure, insurance companies left, and doesn't believe in climate change, so now we're behind and fucked and have this slogan to make ourselves feel less stupid.)"
"My favorite response to all of this is the “Oh this is nothing compared to the last 18 weather events that knocked out the power” like damn, all that time has gone by and no one has come up with a way to keep the power from going out due to someone sneezing too close to a power line?"
"We’re two days away from people losing their minds. Hospitals are maxed out, HFD and HPD are just running in circles at this point. Pretending that this is ‘normal’ is beyond belief…"
Greg Abbott’s Texas…
Honestly we need to start holding center point accountable. It's a private company. Why can't we push them out and have our own govt run agency?  This wasn't even a cat 2 or cat 5 hurricane either. Cat 1 and you down for days?  Common Houston is used to this and the lines should be built to that standard if tech and materials allows. Maybe we need to audit where this 20 dollar fee goes? Lol
"I get downvoted to oblivion every time I say it... But I'm going to keep on saying it.

Houston, fucking SUCKS."
"People keep saying, “ let’s vote these people out” but don’t realize how knee deep red and blue politicians are when it comes to the energy industry. Not only politicians but big developers in the city as well. 

Now I’m not saying blue and red politicians in this city are one in the same but that Houston will never progress as long as the city and state relies so heavily on O&G. 

I advise people to take a toxic tour of the city so you can understand how this industry impacts Houston on every level. 

If you want to vote for change vote with your feet and move."
Dunno why you think a category one is nothing. It will still fuck shit up as we’ve seen many times in the past.
"I grew up in SETX and spent 15 years in Houston. I left. I am happy. No more year round insane heat. No more roaches or mosquitos. Less traffic. Most importantly, no flooding. Houston, I love you; you're a special place but people are not meant to live in you."
"I say this as a native Houstonian, but OH THE IRONY, of a city that is built on the back of the fossil fuel economy getting nailed by climate change. As for the ""we voted for this"" comment, yeah, some did, some didn't. I used to think TX had a voter participation problem and then was schooled when someone said, ""TX has a voter suppression problem."" Yes to all this. It's hard to overcome gerrymandering and terrible legislation when the state continues to gerrymander and suppress votes. Hard, but not impossible. Lookin at you, Georgia!"
[deleted]
"Keep voting in the same assholes, keep getting the same results.  Texans never learn."
Going to invest in the whole house solar/generator..
"Houston will always be ""home"", but I'm starting to get really sick and tired of living here."
"Lived here for decades, and I know ppl are mocking, but it’s true a category one hurricane was not a big scare typically. We’ve never ever evacuated for a hurricane except during Rita when we already had a road trip to see my sibling planned - I don’t really count that.

Now I’m scared and I’m just so tired. Aren’t we all just exhausted? It’s not dramatic to say this is exhausting and is getting worse.

I’ve driven out of disaster flash flood situations and stayed home for much stronger hurricanes over the years. 

The fact that it’s unbearably hot and power seems even less reliable or as quick to fix in the past is unsettling.

I’m tired

I’d love to move."
Friend works for Reliant and he told me to expect 4-5 days. Energy capital of the US and low grade storms and hurricanes take us off the grid. Ridiculous. Everyone who works for ERCOT should be replaced
"capitalism and greedy politicians. its not a sustainable system. the economy is garbage, most people i know are working two jobs and still barely scraping by (myself included). i literally cant afford to miss days of work or have my entire fridge/freezer full of food spoil due to this bullshit"
And how are we the “energy capital of the world…” nvm
Can you imagine how fucked we would be if this was a category 3 or 4? Or God forbid a 5!
A cat 1 hurricane causing 2 million people to lose power is highly concerning
Never forget. Texas has some of the worst voter turnout in America. Typically less just over half the population (51% - 55%) decides how the state behaves. Being in the most populace county means our votes count for a lot. It’s not an immediate fix but voting is the way to secure the future.
"> I love this city

*Why?*"
Vote blue for stronger regulation
"This is so legit, this is the third time after Harvey and the blizzard and still they are not prepared… its a freaking joke."
"Vote for people who will help you, not just people who hate the same as you"
"Just watched Ted Cruz give the usual bullshit speech of “resilience” “ it’s not about race, red or blue it’s about Texans coming together blah blah” “ I’m just as impacted by the storm as you guys.” 

Smh right on cue, can’t wait to see the news coverage of Mattress Mack, Trae the Truth and Joel Osteen giving aid to Houstonians showing how Houston strong we are! Smh lmaoooo"
"No state tax  and  incompetent corrupt government consistently being voted in. 


Not a surprise."
"It made sense in 2018. After all these events, I’m not feeling it anymore."
How did they admit to not prepare repair crews? They had 6000 people from out of the city ready as soon as the storm moved through they started working. It was all over the news.
"Stop voting in republicans. Full fkn stop. I’m not saying Dems are the fix, because Dems are mostly feckless, but begin by voting someone in who will not allow this shit to happen. 

Rule of law is the only thing short of guillotines that’s going to fix/end this shit. "
">How many deaths is it going to take before someone makes a change?  

You'll need to vote out the Republicans  in the state government if you want any change."
$CNP should fire their executive teams that are failing to make reasonable reinvestment and weatherization preparations. (Since they've legislated a bunch of states to remove the word climate change/global warming you have to call it weatherization.)
"Agreed, I am sitting at HEB because it's the only place with power and cell service.  I am done with this fucking bullshit.  I only wish I didn't have so many roots set here.  As a lifelong, born and raised resident all I have to say is fuck this place."
"It’s not a red/blue issue. Money will find its way in every politics. As Texans we are getting too attached to ideology. Ideology will not address these real issues. Whoever is not doing their work, needs to go. Big corporations and donors get cozy with whoever is in power and protects the incumbency. Stop voting along ideological lines only. Basic infrastructure is so basic and we can’t get it right!???"
Greg Abbott's in South Korea Lina Hildago left. Only reason Ted Cruz didn't go to Cancun is they're all so probably dealing with some of the after effects of the hurricane.
"Where is Ted Cruz??
Last time that moron ran away to Cancun"
Welcome to Houston.
I’m glad I left. I love Houston so much but it’s a disaster.
"If we didn't strengthen our infrastructure after Ike, we certainly aren't going to now."
"Hubs had to go to work today because they had power, but HR left out the part where the AC wasn’t working. Bastards!"
This hurricane has shown that Houston is becoming unsustainable.
Shit city
"I’m not a native Texan. I’ve a SoCal native who has been in Texas since 2004. For the facts that my home state is constantly on fire and yes, I did live through the worst earthquakes that Califoria had in modern history (looking at you Northridge Earthquake), this living in Houston thing with the hurricanes is insane. 

I’ve been through Harvey and now this. Our state should stop prioritizing profits and join either the East or West power grids. This is insane. It’s 48 hours without power so far in a heat wave for a Category 1!! And we’re lucky to have a small generator to power small appliances like the fridge, box fans, and chargers. My husband has a good job, I have good doctors, and we have family here so I think we’re stuck here (as much as I want to move home to SoCal). I want to move to a new house and while I know they’re expensive, I want a whole home generator. My health quite literally can’t handle this heat so it’s kind of a necessity if the dang state isn’t going to take care of us and make sure we don’t roast in our houses like Thanksgiving turkeys!"
"Center point is going to benefit from insurance claims for their damages to lines therefore they should not bill all their customers for at least 1week of outages!!

Our stupid Ted Cruz should help us out
We all need to call his office"
I’m literally wearing an old #houstonstrong tshirt reading this. I picked it out in the dark of my closet without knowing what I was putting on.
Just look in the mirror and say Centerpoint three times and your power should come back
"It’s because people from other states control our energy grids, when to turn on and off. Gotta love ERCOT, they f*cked us during the freeze and still continue too. I bet Whitman and Lena Hidalgo all have power though."
"Last winter, I read somewhere (forget which major credible news source) that although the state govt had mandated winterization of the power grid (incidentally, winterization was actually required after major outages in 2011), there were a lot, lot, lot of loopholes for the energy companies to not do the winterization. And don't forget that the ERCOT board members took off and evaded fines and culpability? after the winter storm Uri in 2021 where 246 people died officially related to the statewide outages. Here in Houston, some people were without heat for how long? Up to 2 weeks? And then people got slapped with $9,000/MWh bills."
"One of my brothers has lived in several cities across the US and the world. I was talking about the derecho with him and all the lost power around town, and he says, “you know that’s not normal, right? Other parts of the country don’t lose power -and STAY without power- like Houston does. That city is fucked up.” 

Not normal indeed. F+ck centerpoint."
"I’m just glad CRT has been banned and that we have the 10 commandments in school. That’s focusing on priorities. 

/s"
"It's going to stay that way until Texas shifts politically. The conservatives have been in control of Texas for 3 decades. 1) The pushed us to privatize our energy and 2) they segregated our grid from everyone else. 3) They created ERCOT and put their pals in charge of it. and 4)  have refused to force them to strengthen our power infrastructure. 

  
But the people of Texas will keep complaining that our state is going to hell and keep hiring the same assholes responsible for it...

Tell your neighbors.. ""Look, I get it. Fox has you convinced the left is nothing but pedis reading gay books to your kids in dresses... but please.. if you think there are ANY problems with the way Texas is run... just for 2 election cycles, try voting for a democrat, and see how it goes. If its no better or worse, then go ahead and vote for the GOP again... 

  
Seriously. .I think the Dems could get some traction in Texas is they would run that message... ""just let us try for a few years"""
Real question: why is the energy supply in the hands of one single company? What history or politics led to this situation? Seems having more companies would be the answer.
Definitely in the top five reasons why we left Houston a few years ago. 
"My parents (who live down there) were up here in DFW for the 4th. I offered them another week as it became obvious from channel 39’s hip hop weather report on TikTok that y’all’d be getting a hurricane. 

They went home as planned anyway. They’re already regretting that choice."
I work out of town and before I make plans to come home for a weekend I need to CHECK IF I HAVE ELECTRICITY. Beryl is not the first time. This is not a problem I've encountered in any other city.
"I hope people will remember these moments, use these moments, and continue to try to bring about change through our election process."
IF only there was a national power grid that texas could connect to?
"I did my part. Removed large trees the previous owner planted right under power lines, bought a generator, a small window unit, and made sure the next house I bought had a gas stove and fireplace."
Its probably because the people running the grid have been the same for decades and their goal is making their friends money and not having a functional power grid
"We have to vote for politicians who want to spend money on infrastructure. 

The ones we have now like to blame our crumbling power grid on the federal government and their political rivals, but don't try to address it themselves."
Vote democrat or leave the state. Republicans can not run a functional government. There are essential zero Republican ran states that are not in the red when it comes to governance. Their policies don’t work.
This post is completely on point. 👍
"The state voted for this. 

I would move."
"There's no going back, man. Everyone said that. Everyone knew that. This isn't an ""oops let's walk it back a little now that we've learned our lesson"" situation. It's done. Houston will be unlivable arid dead land in 20 years."
We all need to evacuate this hellscape!
"Vote out Abbot and the GOP, they're the ones keeping us off the grid"
"Texas is a good example of how conservative politics are not intended to actually work. They are only meant to make some kind of point, whether or not it's actually a good point. They are willing to stand by their terrible policies to the death."
"My wife and I just had a conversation this morning. For the second time this year we’ve had to evacuate with power outages and damage to the house. And we lose power during completely normal storms as well. 

Result of conversation is that we are leaving Houston within the next year. Have been here for 10 years and liked it, but I truly believe these disasters are going to become even more common with climate change. My job is remote now and without family tying you to this city there’s just not a big enough draw now. Sucks but it’s just not feasible or safe to remain here any longer."
That decision to start vacation at Vegas looking smarter by the day……
"I definitely get wanting to leave Houston, but not for Alabama"
The sun burns all 🌞 🔥 💰 🔥 🌞
Native Houstonian considering getting the hell outta dodge. I’ve fallen out of love with this place.
"We just moved here in September. We’ve absolutely loved the diversity, beautiful outdoor spaces, and amazing people we’ve met here, but damn if we’re not already making plans to move.
As a Floridian, Texas has not excuse for poor infrastructure, especially with all the money that’s moved into the state in the past few years."
I blame Ercot and the State of Tx. There's only so much a city can do against laxed regulations like that.
After 35 years we moved. Still have our Houston house…glad it survived one last hurricane but it’s about to be someone else’s money pit 🫡
Best option is...move away
The education system down here appears fairly inadequate and half the population is confused about how the civil war ended. Why do you expect that population demographic to select effective leaders? These are the same people that have to be reminded not to drive **into** a flooded road.
"The leadership remains the same. No political action has been taken against the people responsible for the failure of the power grid. The huge influx of federal dollars from the Dems was not used to fix the grid. We are in this mess because our neighbors believe all funding should be going to ""secure our border."" Our neighbors believe that successful previous climate action is actually a failure because the world hasn't ended yet. We are fucked. A nation truly in decline. The empire killer, Afghanistan with the help of COVID, has ended the American dream. We are toast. Burnt toast."
But somehow you keep electing the same douch bag republicans and expecting different results!
Amazing how this turned into politics republican vs democrat post.
"I’m with you on that. I for the life of me can’t understand why so many were out of power and CP was not even ready to roll out a resiliency plan for a Cat 1. You would think they would have a plan for cat 5 no matter which type of hurricane  we get hit with. But instead they snapped back at us on their website. 

I hope someone is filing a civil and or federal lawsuit because I will join them. I’m sure plenty from my community are just as pissed and will gladly join."
Those times have passed. Nothing will change.
GOD you’re tellin me😢
I've used mine up earlier this yr for surgery 😩 I picked the wrong time of year to have it done
"Democrat John F. Kennedy:"" Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country"""
Lol
Then don’t
You dont have electricity and its hot. I wonder if its hot for the guys outside working to fix it. 
😂 😂 😂
Houston strong bitch
Houston is a corrupt cesspool of selfish politicians feeding off of the citizens. They steal cheat and lie constantly. They give contracts to whoever gives them a kickback. They have zero thoughts or cares about the people that live here. This has gone on for decades. It will continue as long as the people continue to allow them to do it.
Houston is literally a 3rd world city
"33. Been here my whole life. As an independent adult and home owner for 3 years now on my own.... First time in my life I've ever considered moving away from the coast. I don't think I can do this every year. With a few more incidents sprinkled in, such as the freeze. I'm not sure I'm built for this life anymore lol"
I broke down at work today. I have a powering pole sitting OUT OF THE GROWN and hanging by the electrical wires over mine and my neighbors house. Now we have three more days of rain. I can’t take much
"Centerpoint stock is up, so investors are happy. Customers can’t leave, so they should save money. 

This is what Texans constantly vote for."
Stop voting red
"I'm from out here and this is normal, in fact is normal throughout anywhere by the gulf coast and specifically the gulf coast. Hurricane Katrina 2005 RIP to all fallen and lost family members to this day should have been ya warning right then and there. 

All these people moving to the bayou city with thier coins and cranking up businesses are completely unaware of what really happens out here is beyond me. Everyone from here knows lights could take up to an week or more. This is the lonely star state there's a bunch of rural areas within 80-100 miles that's been without lights and thats what most out of Towners call the ""country side"" already has thier gas, generators, vegetables and everything in order. 

But I'm glad this is happening so it'll weed out the ones that's not from here complaining because houston is not like NY on the east side or Los Angeles -- these contractors and sub contractors are going to take thier sweet time and get paid.

Yall forgetting there's only CENTERPOINT and ENTERGY out here the only 2 main providers out here.

Welcome to the lone star state."
"I've lived here my entire life and love Texas and where I live but more people lost power in Beryl, a category one hurricane than hurricane Ike which was a category 2 upon landfall in Galveston. Ever since that major freeze and snow the entire power grid has been running off of hot dog water. I wish everyone would band together and force this shit to change but everyone's focused on stupid shit"
"Y’all be sure to research whole house generators look into the battery ones. Saw 10-12 posts those w the natural gas ones some having problems w lines and/or finding the fuel they need. Having a $10-20k Generator and can’t even use it due to fuel issues. That’s one thing that might make me put a Flippen For Sale Sign in my yard and pack up and get the helllooo outta dodge for a long long while. Everyone be safe and please try stay as cool all of you and your pets too as you can w mini showers, cold packs, as much water as possible. 

Upstate NY I heard is going through similar as us too right now and a few other places across the country. Electric came on for 5 mins and went back out again. I knew it would and may for a day or two after it’s back on. Talk about everyone in this family having a f ing meltdown when it went out again. Saw my spouse headed to the patio w a Small cooler of beer muttering about F inggggg Houston! Guessing he’s had enough too! They have a day off after working 7 days straight/12-16 hours. 

He’s not laughing about the kiddie Pools or the low beach seats I bought end last year. I’ve been filling them w Ice Bags and water and him sitting in them when he gets home from working out in heat all day. Whatever freaking works. Be safe keeping ya all in prayers and we’re still all Texas and Houston Strong! 

Still feeling like this is all one big freaking distraction from what state and higher gov don’t want us paying attention to whatever they are trying to screw up or screw us out of next."
"Oh no that Texas strong shit done fed to the birds and they died too. New saying is “Texas Weak” asss power grids. 

THERE IS NO PROACTIVE ONLY REACTIVE. 

100 yr old lady dies from heat and awwwwwww let’s write about it when we we’ve have had over 1000 years to fix this even after the sea wall was built. 22 people died from beryl so far and majority due to heat and POWER GRIDS. Shit never gonna change."
"When you vote and vote D at all levels. If more people  in Houston (and other cities) voted in Democrats, we’d have infrastructure that we need. Republicans give money to corporations with only a pretense of regulation.

I too love this city but am considering moving, but I want to vote for Colin Allred and others before i leave. besides, it’s easier to move when it isn’t boiling hot."
"Have you considered that maybe your states corrupt leadership who continuously have spouted bullshit about how their energy grid model is the best, while consistently having the worse grid outages of any state for decades and still getting re-elected is wild."
You know what would be a good motivator? If everyone went on strike and didn't pay the power bill. If a million people didn't pay their bill for a month they would definitely listen. Especially if it was an organized endeavor.
"Keep voting in Republicans, dummies"
Get solar and battery and an electric car for good measure. Has served me well in two freezes a derecho and now Beryl
H town till i drown
Im sure they will just blame woke power or something just like the freeze.
"I live in Appalachia. This post struck a deep, mournful chord in me."
"Who is to blame for this? 

I’d really like to know because the same ridiculous shit keeps happening is mind blowing for a city of our size"
"If your power goes out every time you have a storm, Houston is the opposite of strong."
"we have branch locations in texas

im amazed how they lose power 1-2x a week at each location

we dont have these issues in our locations in ""3rd world"" countries.

seems like you guys are living in like north korea lol"
Blame the politicians. They pulled out of the national grid so they could manage it themselves. They wanted to do it cheaper and they fucking did. They fucked us.
"The biggest problem is centerpoint refusing to be proactive - my neighbors behind me have trees growing into the power lines running through the backyards. 
I send photos with address to centerpoint monthly and get no response. 
They do not clear the shit thst needs to be cleared during non-emergencies and then lay the blame on homeowners for having trees and shit in the lines. 

Regular tree trimming crews won't touch a tree growing into the power lines, they say you need to contact centerpoint and centerpoint refuses to act. 

So we will continue to have these issues until someone is put in charge over there that forces them to do line cleanup and maintenance outside of storm repairs."
Centerpoint is a fucking joke. Shouldn’t be surprised that nothing is ever done about it
Had to go all the way to Austin to get a generator just to power my fridges and a small ac unit I hate shitterpoint energy
i literally love houston and this constantly happening with no change is making me not want to be here anymore… and i planned to be here for like ever. it was only a category one.. like are they purposely doing this?!?! make it make sense.
I fucking love Houston so much but I am finally ready to start looking at living somewhere else. This is literally unsustainable.
"I hear you. I used to love this city, hate it now… dreaming about the day I have the ability to move."
🤣
"Why would they? Genuinely, why? They have your money and the ability to operate with impunity within the state of Texas so why would they give a flying fuck about you or anyone else? You’re nothing more than a guaranteed dollar sign to them."
Maybe start voting democrat and elect folks that actually care about people over profits.
Texas sucks outside the food.
"Oh man, when I think of Houston I think: ""Nah, I'm good."" Enjoy your big houses that go under water ever 10 years or so."
"Keep voting Republican at the state level,  it will never be fixed because they are bought and paid for."
"If you vote GOP, you can't be bitching about losing electricity every time the weather is out of wack."
Abbott and the other Horsemen of the Texas Apocalypse never pay a political price for their indifference to human suffering. So why should they care?
My grandmas house gets buried in 10 feet of snow and her power is still on but we get a small gust of wind and a rain drop and we’re lights out for a week and everyone is driving like a fucking moron
"Yeah, because the democrat politicians are going to miraculously convert our above-ground power lines below-ground. Great discussion as always r/houston"
"The other side of the coin is that Democrats get into power and concentrate more on social issues that affect a small minority rather than what use to be their meat and potatoes. 

I’m left of center due to my economics and I want a Democrat that will come in and focus on jobs, raising the minimum wage, unions, and infrastructure. “It’s the economy stupid”. It’s a damn shame that Democrats managed to lose a portion of the union vote. Those use to be automatic votes."
Occupy Center Point
Houston strong is bullshit. It's an attaboy for not rioting. When they let us down. Now watch how centerpoint passes these repairs on to its customers. It's always more of the same. Houston is still going to continue to flood the second it rains and power outages will continue to happen the second the wind blows a little too hard. Heads need to roll behind this.
"Love that the outage map was down for retooling and supposedly was going to be up before the end of July.

Probably should have hit that a little harder Centerpoint. 

On another rant Whitmire inserted his own Centerpoint employee to the Chairwoman position of Metro so now every time there’s a weather event I have to worry about being able to get to work as well. (Eye problems) so I’m using PTO because we had to bail for northern counties."
"H-Tiiine Hol’it diiine 🤘🏻

I've never been Houston Strong. Houston is not strong on what I think is important.
"And yet Texans still vote for people like Cruz, Paxton and Abbot."
"To answer every one of your questions: Never. It's never going to get better because politicians and people responsible making sure everything runs efficiently don't care. They absolutely give ZERO f's about every person in the dark right now. Except for themselves, of course, but they have backup generators, so they'll need to sleep with blankets tonight. Their room will be too cold to sleep without a warm, cozy blanket to snuggle up with."

"They're called ""once in a lifetime"" or ""hundred-year"" storms because they're getting worse. Climate change is real. They sold it to us and we bought it, one ""Better Life"" step at a time...
Category 1 is evidently too much for you. 
Hurricanes will always be, whatever category. 
Be thankful it wasn't the Cat 5 Beryl that trashed the Caribbean.

"currently planning to leave, like a lot of other commenters here. I’m just afraid of the shock we’ll face in an area that has a higher COL, but at this point with the way costs are rising here, it won’t be that jarring.

"I’m just glad CRT has been banned and that we have the 10 commandments in school. That’s focusing on priorities.

"I think it goes way beyond Houston as a city. This is what happens when colonialism and corporate interests completely gut the land and make it something it is not. This was always a swamp but then you bring in human hubris of the powerful - here we are. All of these powerhouses are what made Houston a heavily polluted area with no zoning and chemical plants everywhere. Then you touch up on the politics of the place which are also led by corporate interests in BOTH parties - then where is there going to be substantial change? Not to mention, due to Houston being incredibly blue we are constantly being messed with by our very spiteful state government....

Community is what makes Houston great but unfortunately the community is not being nurtured and is in fact being burned out by all of the bullshit. Without a major disruption to the hustle lifestyle here, are we truly unified outside of that? The heat has always been a persistent issue which was getting worse if you paid attention to what is happening to our homeless population, now it's catching up to the working class, middle class, and higher until it's pretty much the end.

So IDK, the onus kinda falls on us too to organize better, get on the same page, and demand in mass what needs to happen....in-person preferably."
houston struggling
"I think of it as a mini vacation. Get time off work, have a big cookout with all the food from fridge/freezer, listen to music until the battery dies and crack open a bottle of vodka. 

There are people in the Caribbean with real problems."
"Maybe you aren't Houston strong? 

I was born and raised in Houston. When we lost power we figured out a way to manage. Heat isn't an issue. It's Houston. Comes as a given. Losing power seems to be a huge gripe here, where is your generator? Don't have one? That's on You. If you failed to mitigate issues that affect you, that's Your fault. It's not a corporations fault that a tree comes down and takes out power. That's just part of life in a first world.

When I lived in the Virgin Islands we were paying nearly 0.50 a kwh for electricity and they had rolling brownouts all the time. No electricity = no water since water came from cistern via pump. That's less than ideal."
"This is really only a problem in the lower socioeconomic areas.


Haven't you noticed how higher median income areas don't suffer. it's messed up. 

Sincerely a person with power - also the energy grid here sucks. Wtb a better power company PGE IS LEGIT"
"I laughed out loud at “How many deaths is it going to take” 

Reddit is so fucking over dramatic."
Vote! Get better smarter people in charge.
“Thanks Biden”

"The reason why the grid is so waked , simply because of the over growth of population. They can’t keep up with all the people moving here . Doesn’t matter what they do ! And can’t complain when power lines are lying on the street. Linemen are working their ass’s off to get it back up an running. It’s hilarious to me how people can’t go one day without power without whining about being hot and pissed about Houston. I’m more pissed about everyone moving here and causing all the problems. It wasn’t like this 10yrs ago."
Good god people are spoiled.
Then gtfo wtf
"Well, it’s a democrat run city. People keep voting these idiots in. The change you want needs to come from the person in the mirror."
Tired of being Houston strong all the time? Lol its only a couple of days of the year. People exaggerate too much.
No city in the country would’ve been able to take this storm without power outages.
"Maybe prepare better next time like an adult? Ya know, with a generator? Maybe some gas? A power bank? This is Houston and we get bad storms. And we live in a giant swamp. The Governor, the Mayor, the police will not save you. Places with better climates cost more and understandably so."

Serious weather! Be careful.

Editing to add: Neighbor’s house was leveled. Talk about conflicting emotions. Relief and grief. Horrible."

Windows blown out of skyscrapers and Minute Maid leaking.
Anyone completely forget Tornado safety and ignorantly watch the storm near their windows 😅
"Upper floor of a high-rise here, *that was a new experience.*

The sky went mint green (not the pale lime I’ve seen in tornadic storms before), then forest green, then black. 

Cargo-blankets of rain, lots of within-5 mile lightening but very little heard thunder until the end."
That was crazy. In Cypress near 290 and Cypress Rosehill. Has there been a confirmed tornado?
The siding of my house got ripped off 😔 Got a giant hole & water leaking from the rain.

I thought this was going to be another incorrect weather prediction and laughed it off but boy was I wrong
"Was on I10 a little after 6 and could see just a black wall to the north and west. Around 630 I was on 610 and in a matter of minutes everything went black. It was wild. 

10/10 storm"
My aunt lives right near Hammerly and the Beltway a tree fell on her house she is going to have a get another roof.   She got a new roof 3 1/2 years earlier.  She is ok.
Scary… Thought my windows were gonna blow out. No power either. Stay safe everyone! I hear ambulances
"Jeez, we might see the sun again today....wtf"
"My girlfriend is back home in Jersey village (I’m out of town on a business trip in Mississippi) and a tree was totally uprooted and a palm tree was snapped and tossed into our apartment complex’s pool.

Idk if it was a tornado but it must’ve been one hell of a storm to uproot those trees like that."
"Well that was fucking crazy. Pitch black outside looked like it was midnight, power went out 3 times thankfully its on now. Pretty sure the building or something very close got hit by lightning, I could hear the power surge. Ca-razy"
Powers out at my local bar. Patio tent is ripped to shreds. The drunks are in shambles
"I watched the velocity radar data while the storm moved through. Looked like the center of it went southeast along 290 on the northwest side of town, then turned more ESE just after it got inside the North Loop 610, then more eastward along I-10 outbound on the east side of town.

That big ol' velocity couplet in OP's lower pic persisted all the way through town. Those dark blues represent wind speeds of up to 100 mph, IIRC. If there *was* a tornado, there'll probably be a damage path through those areas."
Just drove from jersey village to spring. I do not recommend. That was absolutely wild
Thanks for all the updates. I’m in Washington Ave area and lost power about an hour ago. Stay safe out there everyone!

"Thank goodness for my neighbor. He knows I have back issues and came over to get some limbs cut back from the roof. Great guy.

I was outside when this came
Wife just told me some trees got fucked up and part of my fence is down.
My power just came back on. 45 and Telephone area.
How is OP so cool
Hope everyone is okay after that tropical storm hurricane tornado thunder storm.
No power in clear lake
"With this many people without power, are we talking days to get it back?"
"wild, quite the gully washer"
No power in the energy corridor for the last hour or so. That was rather “spicy” for sure!
"I drove from my job (west of IAH) to Kingwood, and ohhhhh myyyyyy gooodnessss. That was fucking wild, my car was shaking in the wind. Wtf"
Anyone see Minute Maid park get a ton of water blowing in it
Bro I was in the fkn tornado on the way home from work on the inner loop and 610
"The wind kept changing directions! At one point, I could hear the branches of trees on my front yards scraping across the roof. And those branches are pretty high *above* the roof on a normal day. Wind wa just pushing the trees sideways. 

We have no power since 6:30 pm. 

Injury report: I broke a toe. And I wanna know who moved that damned footrest!"
"I was driving from Cypress to Museum district with that massive black cloud in my rear view mirror the whole time, then RIGHT when I exited it finally caught up to me😭 in the blink of an eye, it went from no rain to sideways rain.. it looked like I was in a hurricane / tornado, trees falling next to me and debris hitting my car... I pulled over to park in some neighborhood and some really nice strangers let me into their house to wait it out😭 scariest storm experience ever omg"
"My mom lives in Katy and works at a drug store. She sent me pics of the sign of their building where one of the letters ripped off from the wind and the signage by the street came off. The gas station across the street had their roof cave in. This is wild. 

I'm in Montrose and my dog never gets scared during storms but woudnt stop shaking. I had to swaddle him to get him to calm down."
That was wild omg. Had just got home from work and then boom 5 minutes later power went out and I started hearing violent winds.
I was on 610 west and it was insane.
"At least 4 fatalities from the storm, per the mayor’s office."
Jebus F Christ. I left the Wortham theater at 6:30 PM and headed down Memorial only to see broken tree limbs fly by my truck. Lightening everywhere and Memorial was a river. I ended up under the new tunnels until it blew over. That shit was fucking crazy. I got out of downtown just as the glass from the buildings began to fall.
"Centerpoint reporting > 850k without power.

"We just drove through it off 290 and Fry. The lightning was bad, the sky turned a greenish, then the rain hit. There was hail and the wind was insane. We were all trying to park under the overpass for cover."
"I was in willow brook mall, they are closing the mall. Lights were flicking, it was pitch dark. The bright side is that the worse part passed and we were able to walk out and head home. Be careful if yall are out."
Definitely just got FCKD UP in Katy near Cypress... I think we got lucky
"Tore up Bellville again, we just got back on our feet from the last one. Time to get the chainsaw out again."
"Multiple power lines down, mild flooding 107 mph wind gusts"
Dayum!  It was bad in midtown saw 1 leaning electrical poll by work
Anyone else's power out
Power out for the last hour or so at the Galleria area. Centerpoint outage tracker isn't tracking. Jackery power station is working overtime.

"Spring branch area, tree fell in the driveway, and can't get out. Missed my landlord's house by *that* much.  Power out, besides LL's backup generator."
That appeared out of no where! Looks like the worst passed here in the heights
That shit was kinda scary not gonna lie
"My knees were literally shaking, yall. I thought for sure one of the single-pane windows of my old ass house was gonna get busted as I could hear them rattling (they are all intact). I then heard a crash and it was the giant tree next door falling onto my house.  🙃

Scary shit. This will be fun to deal with in the morning.

Power is still out over here in Fifth Ward"
What app is that?
Giddy up mofos
"Jersey Village here, no power, busted window and water went over my rain boots😖"
"I’m in Cypress, my roof is trashed!"
"Tornado in Katy
Passed thru my neighborhood"
[deleted]
We just got our power back on I live in Friendswood
"Not my first storm but my first time dealing with it alone. I've been blessed in the past to have been home or not in Houston for major weather incidents. I made the noob mistake of taking my usual route home, which flooded. I was also genuinely convinced my car was going to fly away. I finally relaxed when I got home. I was so relaxed that I managed to throw up lol. I work at a preschool so I didn't check my phone until it was too late."
I’m near Upper Montrose and I’m not sure what’s going on cuz I sheltered in the middle of the house but it sounds awful outside. Like the wind is hitting the entire building from all directions. Anyone felt or saw similar in the area?
We were at 610 North and 69 at about 6:35 pm. Hit by either really high winds or potentially a tornado. There was a lot of debris (tin/sheets of metal from a roof?) being blown across the highway and hitting cars. Hit by hail (dime to maybe ping pong ball sized). It was extremely bad for about 15 minutes. Sheltered with a bunch of cars and a metro bus beneath an underpass
Clear Lake here; winds picking up and starting to rain hard. We still have power
"to everyone who said they were on the roads when this hit, glad y’all are ok 🙏 100+mph winds was insane to witness inside but to be in the car… jeezus"
power restored in heights
"Houston, we have a problem."
I got caught in it on 11th and Yale. I’ve never been so scared in my life
For you folks who have never been through a hurricane: Imagine the worst of tonight's storm. Then imagine that for about 12 hours straight.
Just ate curry in the dark for dinner
Almost knocked my fence down off j.c. Blvd and petty street roughly 6:30. Power out and rain still going sideways. Stay safe everyone.
"I live in a townhouse apartment on 3rd floor, where's the best place for me to go? There's not really space on the ground level, I'd be standing in front of the front door essentially."
I was at the beach
This is going to take a while to clean up
Yeah where I stay it was crazyyyyy
It was pretty gnarly. I live in the heights and we’re all out of power
Seems like a tornado touched down. Near Love Park on 11th.
"I heard it was really bad.
I pray the people are safe."
"I don’t live there so I just heard about this, and I’m so so sorry to everyone who was affected by this. I have family in Montgomery; I’m guessing this stayed to the south of there, correct? I don’t wanna wake them up so I’ll reach out to them in the morning. I appreciate any info!  
Sincerely, an Okie"
Waking up at 3:45am because of a transformer blowing up twice. I still don’t have power. How are these transformers still exploding without power? It’s extremely loud and fills the sky with a greenish yellow color.
Power out along Stanford in Montrose.  Thank goodness I have a generator! Phew!
"Drove thru it, 10/10 for the Twister Experience."
"I’m genuinely fucking tired of severe/freak weather events happening while I’m home alone with an infant and a 5yo

I was home alone, pregnant, watching my friends 2 month, with my 4yo, when a tornado ripped down our street last year. He was at work then, and didn’t believe me when I initially told him “fucking tornado!”

And now there’s been several since my husband started working out of town. 

I’m just over it"
"In spring branch. The weather is insane, red and green flashes and my back fence just came down wth idk how to fix a fence locked my cat in a closet."

"Nothing going on down my way (Friendswood) yet, but it just got black as night outside *quick*."
Just lost power here in Deer Park.
Anyone know if H-E-B in the heights is open?
Dang man when’s the power coming back on
Anybody in or near Baytown have any info? My mom lives in the area
My parents live in Katy and said it got black
"power out in 77057 (Briargrove) from 6:30pm to just now. Neighbor’s roof came off, kinda scary"
In Channelview trees down. Debris everywhere.  That was intense wind. Power is out.
East end still no power I heard the mayor say up to 24 hours of no power???
Power back on in Shady Acres. It appears to be 22nd and north. 21st and South is still without power.
"KILLEEN/ FT HOOD/ BELTON, NOLAND CREEK flooded agaaain, jumping the 15ft bank! making lakes along the creek from FT HOOD to Belton that i know of.Hail & major flooding & Rain worse than Jungle rain, Sun mothers day, & again today!"
I experienced 80 MPH winds from the 25th floor where my outer walls are either half or whole floor to ceiling glass; windows that open out were rattling loud. Figure this glass is pretty strong after surviving this. My huge German Shepherd was like🤔 I don’t like this one bit…Pretty scary😱
"Timbergrove Manor reporting in, albeit late. Lived in Houston since 2002, worst wind weather I’ve seen. Lots of mature trees in the neighborhood are down, some of them on homes. Various points on E TC Jester near Timbergrove are blocked by downed trees. No power, of course."
How nice of Reddit to suggest this two days later.  Still no power here Lakes at Northpoint.
Still have power in West U as of 6:45.  Wind and thunder really booming.
that was insane😔 my cat was so scared
"If you received hail or high winds, reach out to me for a free roof inspection! 

I recently started a new career and I'm out and about all over Houston obtaining new clients!

The company I'm with is really doing it right 👍"
[deleted]
At 249 and 99. Swear there had to be a tornado close. Shit was wild for a bit. Anyone know if there was one? Power out.
"I didn't get a tornado alert on my personal phone and IDK why but the alert was in Spanish on my work phone. I remember thinking ""huh, wonder what that's for."" 🤦‍♀️ I thought it was just a lot of rain until I saw the news."
Any concerns more north? Montgomery county area? Or does the weather seem focused in the Houston area?
No power in the highlands and the winds are crazy !
I'm hunkering down in a hospital in med center. When is a good time to go on highway?
My neighbors fence blew down in a storm last year and now two more sections just blew down. My outdoor furniture was scattered to hell but no damage.
Any word on Alvin? I have relatives there.
Near Northside got hit hard. Power gonna be out a while. Anyone got a radio station to listen to for info?
Anything on the Tomball area?  Supposed to drive in tomorrow for the weekend.
My backyard fence got knocked over due to this weather it’s insane
"[https://www.tornadohq.com/#map](https://www.tornadohq.com/#map)

Not fun today!"
"A tornado went directly through my backward, destroyed the fence, and just generally fucked everything up. 

I wasn’t prepared for that to happen; I did not even know it would be raining today, but you’re doing gods work by making people aware of this."
"I never lost power and my house and property is intact. I hope y’all are safe.

Also, I’m new to the group 👋🏽"
"any replay footage from abc13?

Going off this for now

"Hope y'all are all OK!! That was some crazy shit last night - we're in Cypress and a lot of businesses are still without power this morning

Thankfully our power only blinked off for a minute or so during all the excitement yesterday but it came back pretty quick

Stay safe everyone ❤️❤️"
Currently around Sealy in a school bus to Katy. This is gonna be a movie

We got hit hard in Katy/Cypress
Barely missed me in fulshear holy
That storm was a trip... didn't see that coming!
Stay safe everyone
man i was driving in the city and all of a sudden the sky turned BLACK and it was flooding AND the wind was HORRIBLE!!! it literally hailed.
Any confirmed tornadoes touched down?
"It sounded loud but it was just a lot of sideways rain.
Hopefully everyone still has electricity."
Did Katy evacuate yet?
Power is out around the Westlake subdivisions near Katy.
Heavy rain and winds in New Caney
"Still got power in my part of 3rd Ward...

Just a lot of trees swaying back and forth....

Power flickers a little bit every time lightening strikes close by....

All's well, really....it's pretty much done over here."
I called my buddy over in Pearland. Just lots of rain and decent amounts of wind. How is everyone holding up over there?
Power’s out in uptown
FedEx building on 99 in cypress got hit pretty hard. Some trailers overturned.
Still without power in montrose 😭
Hello
It was nasty and well a prep for what maybe ahead this hurricane season.
Got permission to invest in a fee other items a t the house now :)
Down town houston is bad some buildings windows are blown out  some people are still with power
"I live in Cypress and the tornado hit Bridgeland, twelve minutes away from where I live. My entire neighborhood has stop signs that have been ripped out of the ground, trees and utility poles knocked over, etc. When the storm came thru, it was incredibly scary watching the sky turn black SO FAST"
"I hope all are well. We were lucky in League City and caught a glancing blow. My area looks pretty good but there are many more places that families are left devastated. My son and daughter on the northeast side are undamaged but without power for the time being. I’m currently looking at routes to get to The Heights to get a generator to my elderly in-laws. 

I’m hoping we can pull together, like Houston always does, and get each other through this event. Stay safe everyone."
This Grid in Texas needs to be fixed!
Just seeing this now 😭
This shit got wild FAST.
Wish I got a notification about this four days ago:/
"fuck it uber eats time, make the big bucks tonight!"
"Brit here travelling around Texas. Houston is our last stop.
Was staying in a sky-rise Airbnb in the Rice Neighbourhood.
That shit was crazy. Sirens were going off on my phone (we don’t get that in the UK!), power went out and then the downtown buildings disappeared in the black sky.

In our shared experience, can I be anointed as an honorary Houston-citizen? 

Hope those still without power get theirs restored soon."
Any major damage in Tomball?
(:
Hope everyone is okay after that tropical storm hurricane tornado thunder storm.
"Uh oh, time for Texas to switch into socialism mode again LOL!

I love seeing all the mad Texans down voting, because you all know it's true hah"
Lovely.. I have to make a trip to MD Anderson in the next 30 minutes. Should I stay put? Currently in Southeast Houston near Pasadena.
Did Katy evacuate
Barely missed me in fulshear holy crap

"My heart goes out to those in the path of the storm . 



    Now that being said welcome back to the USA. You can bark and pull at your chain but every time something goes wrong ""oh no big poppa government save us "" . We are here to help stop telling us you can do this on your own because all that that's doing is fucking up the system you morons. Stop letting them steal all your hard earned money and then give you mediocre service."
That was an engineered storm... Like they opened a refrigerator and flipped a wind switch... Be honest you've never seen a storm like that... I literally saw whirlwind tornados going back and forth that was different
Don’t worry your governor has it taken care of. Sorry for the people without power but F off Texas. Abbot has you covered. 🤣

Good blow all of Houston away…place is terrible.
I’m trying to see a tornado for the first time but I’m south :/
"It's national and international news reports like this that always seem to end up having me remind family and friends in other parts of the country that the Houston Metro Area is about the size of Massachusetts, and while there is flooding in some areas, it's fine where I live."
My whole house flooded in Porter we lost all of our stuff as we just moved in and everything was on the floor
"My sisters road in Kingwood was flooded up to the curb yesterday at 4 pm, meanwhile I was sat with hubby at the bar patio inside the loop enjoying a drink while chatting with her.   They were at that time just about to open the second flood gates!    This morning where I am the thunder is very loud and the rain is torrential, but no flooding, I’m just hoping it doesn’t rise that much for her today"
Meanwhile Braes Bayou is barely even up
"And now queue the lawsuits between the people that live on lake Conroe that don't want to flood and the people downstream that don't want the dam to release water so lake Conroe doesn't flood. Ah, summer in Houston."
So... I shouldn't go out for Cinco de Mayo?
Aaaaand this is why homeowners insurance providers are starting to pull out of the Houston area.
"There must be CEOs who decided not to relocate to Houston because of multiple ""100-year floods"" in the last 30 years.

""But it doesn't flood in [insert area of town].""

How do workers in flooded areas get to their jobs? Are roads, freeways and public transportation affected? Is flood insurance, if available,  affordable? What's the cost of standard homeowner insurance? What about all the bad actors who clean up totaled/flooded cars and try to sell them?

Blanket, nationwide coverage like this is bad PR. It can't be spun with ""It's OK here,"" or ""It's not a hurricane.""

Hurricane season starts on June 1."
"""Get in a basement""
Aren't there like no basements in Houston homes?"
"If you are in the NRG area, go inside the stadium where the Texans play. There are no touchdowns there…."
Sky looks like there's a fight between voldermort and Harry Potter up there.
Watching the sky close to Cypress by 1960. It's non stop illuminated by lightning.
Cypress too
"Haha, I’m in danger."
"Step 1: build a basement
Step 2:..."
please help im scared and
Where did one touch down?
It’s lit y’all
What do you do during a tornado warning?
I'm at the movies at Willowbrook... hopefully this building is safe 🤷🏼‍♀️
Did anybody else happen to hear that weird thunderstorm noise by the way???? Anybody catch it on film?
This is like the fourth tornado that has spawned out at frickin Barker Cypress and Tuckerton.
[deleted]
"That boom.was no joke, it was loud. 😳"
"That shit was crazy last night!! We live in Cypress and my husband and I were watching the radar track the storm going right down 290 basically. We were getting some pea-sized hail with the torrential rain, I have no idea how fast the winds were.

Thank God my son is a heavy sleeper 🤣🤣 And amazingly we never lost power! Our neighborhood is notorious for blackouts when the wind blows too hard in Hockley lol"
[removed]
Just heard lightning hit extremely close to us…..God help us all bruh
[deleted]
Thunderstorms like last night's make me sleep like a baby.
"I will say this is where Dallas has us beat. Their storm tracking and weather warning system is way better in terms of tornadoes. I mean every time there you can easily turned either a tv on or news radio and get updates warning and if touchdown movement. They have sirens to warn as well.

Here you just have to watch the NWS website and hope you don’t have to go to cover."
It’s taking cat and dog outside
Welp
"“Hey google, does houston have tornadoes?”



Oh fuck…."
If this moves over towards the cypress/ Katy area can y’all let me know please
"Ike was worse overall but in terms of impact per minute of intensity this wins. It was fine, then fucked, then downright sunny within a little over an hour. Ike felt like several hours of chaos."
"This is the most extreme solitary thunderstorm I’ve been in, no question. Like a hurricane but unexpected and brief."
"I work in HVAC and was in Cypress when the storm hit. I was outside looking at the customer's condenser when I got a tornado warning and it was damn near sunny out. I went inside and up into the attic to check something, and in the 3 minutes it took me to come back down the attic stairs the power went out and it was pitch black outside and the wind was howling. Like literally HOWLING. Myself and the customer's wife and daughter sheltered under the stairs (I had literally met them about 5 minutes before) and I held the wife's hand as she prayed and I did my best to help comfort the daughter while scared shitless at the hell that was being unleashed outside... most interesting call I've ever been on to say the least."
This was the first time in 20 years I’ve ever been legit scared of Houston weather.
"I lived downtown Houston during Ike. The damage DT from today's storm looks way worse than it did the day after Ike. And it was pretty bad back then. I'll never  forget so many windows blown out on the one side of the Chase tower and all the glass on Main St.

We'll see how long the power will be out. It was about 6 days for me after Ike. The long lines waiting for gas were the worst."
This was definitely a bunch of craziness however I remember when Harvey turned beltway 8 into the Gulf of Mexico and that’s a sight I will never forget watching waves hit the exit signs at beltway 8 and town and country was absolutely mind boggling
I feel bad I'm in Richmond Rosenberg area just chilling no idea until an out of town family member checked in and gave me a heads up of what's going on! Some crazy destruction going on out there!
Is this another once in a lifetime event?
"Hell no. Ike and the winter storm hit me for multiple days, power and no heat for days was a pain in the ass. Wondering when you’re going to get to the store again to buy water does not compare to this. 

This was terrifying, my car and house fence was damaged but at least I didn’t need 3 blankets and clothes to keep warm through the night. "
The crazy wind and storm patterns... I literally saw the trees bend in the complete opposite direction when the wind direction suddenly changed. It was crazy.
"Idk, the Rita gridlock actually traumatized me as a kid. But this was def up there with the worst. Shit felt kinda biblical. Like a brief but intentional pummeling"
"Nothing was worse for me than staring at my phone all night looking at Godzilla sized rain bands park over Houston and water rise in my house during Harvey. Worst night of my life. 

Yesterday’s storm was harrowing but brief. And the damage done to Houston pales in comparison to what Harvey did."
"I've been here 20 years, Ike and Harvey did nothing to us on the norrhwest side compared to the storm tonight. It's crazy, just fucking crazy. One of my trees is half way down the street, the rest of it in my neighbors car. The neighbors behind me tree is now half my back yard. My neighbors brick wall fell down. Splat. Its insane. The sirens have finally stopped. Its been 6 hours of straight sirens in all directions."
"This is the first time I’ve had home damage from a storm, so I’m kind of in shock. Luckily I have insurance but it’s not fun."
"Yeah definitely.  My wife and I are both born and raised in Houston.  Both 50+.  We have been through many hurricanes.  We both concluded that the winds were worse than any hurricane we have been through.  We didn't have a tornado hit us, but it sure felt like it."
Wildest weather even in your lifetime SO FAR.
"I never post or comment like ever, just enjoy Reddit. However, this was the first time I ever legitimately thought I was probably not going to make it. I got caught by the storm on the beltway bridge going North from Pasadena. I have a big truck and it felt like someone grabbed it from the top and was shaking it. Been through all the hurricanes we’ve been hit by here in Houston and this was way more extreme and sketchier for the minutes it took me to drive over the bridge. 100% would rather deal with a flood every few years than those 20 minutes like yesterday. I felt like I had nowhere to run or hide, legit thought my truck would get flipped off the bridge for a bit. Crazy shit."
No dude I’ll take this over the ice storm again.
"It’s terrible but I can’t rank this ahead of the magnitude of destruction from Harvey, nor the absolute chaos of Rita, nor the insane cold of the 2021 storm. The surprise factor is certainly off the fucking charts. I went from about to sit down  to eat dinner (thankfully dinner was earlier than usual, because we thought we had a meeting to go to), to worried my house was going to get destroyed in about 10 minutes."
Yea it is wild how messed up everything is out there. Are people still without power? We lost ours for about ten minutes on Westheimer near Gessner.
It's a good preview for new comers what hurricane level winds are like. Except it will last well over a day when the real storms set in. Prepare now!
Lived here all my life and I never have seen a freak storm that bad here. I fucking drove through that shit outside of downtown last night. I sheltered inside the new tunnels on Memorial until it blew over. Tree limbs were breaking off trees in Memorial Park and the wind just picked them up and they were gone. Crazy shit.
"I moved here from Louisiana and have dealt with hurricanes my whole life and can say with confidence that this was the craziest weather I've ever seen in my life! In the span of ten minutes - I got an alert for severe weather on my phone, looked out the window and saw nothing going on but asked partner if we should bring in the chairs ""just in case"" to huddled in our downstairs bathroom with my cats as we could hear trees falling outside.  Just glad that we got thru it okay with nothing but a power outage on our end"
lol this was fucking awful but harvey and ike were far far far worse. crazy to even say otherwise. i have two holes in my roof from branches and water in my house but id rather do this again than ike or harvey. this was not worse. absolutely fucking wild to say it was.
"This was more wild than that freak storm we had last year in the spring area that took our power out for a couple days. These weather events will become more and more common as time goes on. Get used to it, this is only the beginning."
"I’ve lived in Houston off and on for more than 40 years; I’ve never seen a storm like this. The devastation is shocking for the way it unfolded. The closest thing I’ve seen compare are pictures from Tornado Alley. 

With the average thunderstorm, there’s a warning. Not from the news, but from the storm. Thunder, lightning, something. There was no wind or rain here- everything was calm while we watched television- and the first sign that a storm was on us was the sound of pieces of my metal roof being ripped off and slamming against the side of the house. The relentless impact shook the whole upstairs. 

It was insane. Just 0 to 100 literally."
"I mean you say that, but a bad hurricane spawns a shit ton of tornadoes. There's a couple specific streets specifically here in KW where were completely devastated after Ike because of all the secondary tornadoes."
"I had to drive from The Woodlands to 290 and Tidwell as Harvey made landfall.    I would much rather drive through that again than go through the ten minutes of sheer terror I just went through.  My wife and I were in our driveway in our truck after a doctor's appointment, when the skies just opened up, the wind blew trees into the aerial power lines behind our house and killed our subdivision's power.  I looked at the videos from our security cameras, the storm started at 6:10 and ended at 6:30 but it managed a lot of sheer destruction in that short window.  All of my adjacent neighbors have tree damage, two lost entire trees, one lost one of the primary branches off the root trunk.  Our fence is not long for this world either, one of the trees tried to push it over.  It now leans at a worrying 50 degrees..."
"Damn I moved to Houston a year and a half ago and I thought this was not normal but not as bad as you guys have seen before. Gotta say I’m glad it’s not normal.

I drove through the eye of the fuckin storm. Good lord my car was getting pushed left and then right to the side multiple feet..  driving 15 mph. Finally managed to get off 610 and hid at the underpass on tc jester. And then got stuck behind traffic with a downed power line across 290. I saw green flashes from multiple transformers exploding. When I left the underpass there were trees and building panels all over the road. That shit was wild"
I’m downtown. Glass everywhere. But we have power! Lol
"Driving around downtown after the 30 ish minutes of super intense weather was kind of haunting. Almost everywhere has their power out, traffic lights and streetlights are out, building damage and giant trees laid over in to the road."
I got stuck at the gym and literally watched the storm roll in. Scariest moment of my life but I definitely got some gains in 😪😂
Were you here for Hurricane Ike in 2008? If not this is a foreshadowing for this high output hurricane season 2024
Not from Houston been down here 10 years. This is the first time I was scared of the weather. I was in my car under an overpass on I-10 when it all hit
Come on. Ike was incredible in terms of wind and fury compared to this
I was driving through it as it was rolling through Brenham (Literally had no idea it was going to be THAT bad)- It was certainly a top 3 weather event for me as well- the last two times I got caught on the road like that and it would be comparable would be the Tax Day flood and a out of nowhere storm I got caught up in trying to leave Corpus Christi a few years back.
My big ass tree is now in my attached garage with my car
"I don't know man, Houston's steady state when it comes to weather seems to be chaos, partial recovery, chaos. I have seen some absolutely insane weather here, and one of the rain cells during Harvey was over where I am southside. That is still one of the craziest events I've seen. But I suspect if you are in the Heights or that triangle north of Downtown between i10 and 290, yesterday was insane (while Harvey wasn't much of anything.)"
"Out of curiosity, why is the weather so bad in Houston this year?

I was flying United and inbound aircraft was coming in from Houston, ended up being delayed 3.5 hours. I checked the weather and it seemed like there was a thunderstorm every single day. Why is it so much worse this year compared to previous years?"
[deleted]
"Do **Not** go to HEB tomorrow. Their power is out too. Cold canned food it is. If there’s even still a road, probably not gonna happen anyway."
Frank Billingsley going out with an absolute bang
Did a tornado actually touchdown anywhere? I think most of this was high winds not a tornado
I was inside a brick building the entire time and couldn’t eceb tell there was 70 mile winds outside  … that needs to be the standard of all homes in Houston
"This definitely reminded me of bad hurricanes back in South Louisiana where I’m from. I definitely need to restock on batteries, flashlights and fans. The memorial area where I am got rocked."
"The big deal here was how sudden and seemingly out of nowhere it was. I was working and had a movie on and heard a loud beeping that I thought was the movie for a good while. I looked at my phone, and it was like tornado, seek shelter now! And I was like wtf. With other major storms, we've had some warning--well, sort of except for Allison, at least for me (I wasn't keeping up with the news).

As bad as this was, the trauma from Allison was so very real...and then the Memorial and Tax Day floods, I lost a car and my building flooded both times, and I got to where if it was raining heavily, I'd have anxiety attacks that everything was flooding again and couldn't sleep. With Ike, I was hiding in my closet. The sky was green. There were horrible noises all around for hours and I was scared my roof was going to come off."
I heard this post quoted on NPR this morning. Knew it must be from here.
They keep saying it wasn’t a twister .. but it sure Acted like one..
Just moved from Oklahoma not long ago.  Felt a lot like tornado season storms.
"This is probably the first time ever my area wasn’t affected by a big storm. I’ve lived through all of the above here. Harvey was the worst. Had to be rescued out of my home. Today it was just like a regular thunderstorm. Sorry to everyone dealing with this. Good
Luck! I’ve definitely been there"
"I grew up in tornado alley. I honestly didn't think this was that big of a deal compared to past weather events in Houston I've been here for, but also, I don't live north of i10 where I heard it really went off."
"I was driving back from Baytown and I did not feel as much fear as I should have. 

I was resigned to it. 

""Oh, damn, this is a lot... should probably get away from this semi"""
We got super lucky. Finished eating at Texas Roadhouse while the wall of water went through. Then drove around some broken tree branches to get home.
"I was in the gym sauna, had absolutely no idea it was even supposed to rain. 

I go to leave the gym and there’s a crowd of about a dozen people and I see trees whipping around outside. It passed really quickly so I didnt think much of it, but got home and there was no power and tree limbs down. 

What’s up with these random ass intense as fuck storms?? I’ve lost power twice now in two weeks from the storms 

I’m not excited about storm season"
"I'm acutely aware when it comes to weather changes during this time of year. 

Habitually, one of the things I do is check the weather forecasts.

Depending on the direction it's coming from and the size of the event, I'll pay more attention to it. 

I learned my lesson when Allison snuck up on me."
"I'm 33 years old and I've lived in Houston my entire life, born and raised. I've never seen weather like yesterday evening, literally NEVER!!!!!"
"Trees fell and closed off our street, aall the men on our street including myself brougbt out machetes hatchets, axes, saws and did everything we could to clear the street! They knocked down the power lines so our recent trip to Sam’s Club is down the drain. A tree in our back yard is completely out of the ground and a tree in our driveway landed INCHES from my truck when it fell. Truly a crazy experience! My wife had been at a hotel downtown celebrating a week long Mother’s Day with our daughter arriving there yesterday morning. All this to say, I’m glad they were somewhere that was mostly unaffected, I drove from NE Houston to downtown and it was pitch black. the devastation we witnessed the morning was unreal."
"There was a tornado? Well, that gives some context to the text my dad apparently left a few hours ago."
"I didn't feel to much down here in League City on the water. Guess we got the backside or something sky was a little green and a ton of lightning, but not too much wind."
"Myabe I have to get outside, but that was 10 minutes of strong wind and a lot of rain with the lights flickering a bit while I ate dinner. On the other hand I still have PTSD from Harvey. I didn't have power water or heat for almost a week in the second to last winter freeze. What am I missing."
Harvey was fucking horrifying but this shit was so sudden I’m like still processing how insane it was
Those tornadoes that hit south Hou and Pasadena last Jan was the weirdest....tore my apt complex up smh
"I was in the path of the worst wind (Shady Acres/Heights) and it was legitimately scary. In Houston since 2007, so I have several events to compare to."
How was Hurricane Beryl
Ike and Harvey were much longer lasting and harder to live through. The 2021 freeze was the absolute worst. The 2015 Memorial Day floods devestated my home. But Last night? The McDonalds line was too long and I had to sleep with a window open. Obviously each diaster impacts people differently. Id still say it was a top 5 event though. Number 5 for me.
This is not worse than hurricane harvey. Would really take a hurricane over a tornado??? Ive lived through all those storms you listed and nothing comes close to hurricane harvey.

77011 - still out. Caved and got a generator & a window unit & a mini fridge yesterday. My bedroom is now my tiny dorm. 😂
"Reminder:  

Don't be in a hurry to fully restock your fridge."
"77057 Woodway and Voss - is today the day? Who even knows. I don’t know if CP gave up on us or what. Feels like my lights and AC will never come back. And then the other part of me is like if I can go almost a week without power in Houston in the summer, I can do anything😂"
Day fucking 7 without power. The people right across the street from me got power back on Thursday....
77008 no power - CenterPoint refuses to send anyone.  I hate this company with the fire of a thousand suns
"Reporting, once again, from the sweltering heat of 77007. Current restoration estimates say Monday. I am losing my mind."

"I called 'Time of death' on my generator at noon yesterday after trouble shooting all morning (carburetor is clean/unplugged,  not overfilled with oil/gas).  I took my super grungy self to Lowes and blew a cool grand on a duel fuel generator.  Came back home.  Got it set up and running by 3ish.  Power came on at 8PM.....at least I'm ready for the next one.  "
77345 back of Kingwood.  100kish without power in greater humble.   I would be stunned if the Tuesday estimate is met for my street.
"I’m pretty discouraged about getting my power back anytime soon. Someone stole the breaker box off of my house and I already had bad tree damage, it’s a rental house and the landlord isn’t very good about repairs. Can’t even get a reply "
"Posting again because wtf else am I gonna do with my day off without power?  77092 at Antoine and 43rd.  Still no power.  We got an arbitrary date on the map, but judging by what else has been said in these threads I’m not holding my breath.  I would leave if I could, but three animals and nowhere else I can go plus I can’t afford to miss work.  I’m exhausted, tired, threw my back out yesterday, at least was able to borrow my parents generator and can run it through the night for me and my neighbor to be able to have a fan while we sleep but am outta money to keep the thing fed.  I tried to apply for FEMA aid but got an identity error so no luck there yet.   Just moved here in April and really regret that decision so far."
"77035, we’re in a nested outrage (pun intended) of only 3 houses."
So basically CP has blanket email going out and saying 19th lmao. Fuck this company
77077 we got power back for 10 mins and now gone. I cannot do this anymore. I’m losing my mind
There’s far more than 461K “customers” without power. A conservative low headcount is probably close to 1.5MM
"77076 nested outage, I haven't seen any movement by Centerpoint around. I'm just like ""whatever"" now."
77007 Wescott/Washington power back last night
"My in-laws (and their cats) are going on nearly a week of living with us. Their place at 77069 (champions area) finally has an ETA of the 17th so we’ll see if that holds true. It’s at least calmed my mother-in-law down and made her a bit less crazy forgetful so I’ll take it. Their place in 77554 (past Jamaica beach where it is back to being Galveston) is actually slated to be online today so we’ll see if that is true. Their place there sustained roof damage, but the roofers found the roof is repairable, which at $1500 to repair it versus $29000 for a new roof…is pretty damn amazing.

Both of my in-laws are sick, but I thankfully haven’t caught it which is pretty good since I’m pregnant and have a weaker immune system. My mother-in-law wants to help me with housework everyday but I’m just like nah, im good. Touch as little as possible. I’m gonna have to sanitize spray the house down many times after they leave to feel comfortable."
77007 trucks in our area on blossom/patterson.
"77066, still no power. And now CP is taking about ""nested outages"" that could take extra time to repair.  Great 🙄 Blessed to be in the little 1/4 mile spot with no power while everyone else around the area is fine. "
"77396

Still no power but crews have been in neighborhood since 11am today.

I spoke to them briefly and essentially, he told me that they are stuck until a certain machine arrives to put the power back on the entire neighborhood .

The crew is from Ohio and they’ve been waiting here all day for the machine to show up and it hasn’t .

I asked him what the holdup was and he just blatantly told me centerpoint. They don’t know where the machine is and they don’t know when they will arrive. 

So great I’m stuck without power for another day, because Centerpoint doesn’t know where the machines are ….."
"77521, Baytown. Line is still down at the end of my street (one house away from me). I still have not seen anyone come and even point their eyes at it. 

CP map shows my neighborhood as energized. I've received zero updates from CP PAS. 

I reported the outage again today. That will achieve... well nothing probably. 

Borrowed a small generator from work, but I don't have the money to keep filling it up and also eat and also put gas in my car, etc.

Filled out the FEMA stuff yesterday to try and recoup some of the money I've wasted because of this, and was flatly denied. 

I have zero hope at this point. I have a dog and seven cats I'm obligated to, so I can't just up and leave. I also have aquariums that are going to crash soon without filtration. 

My mother is in hospice in Jasper, because all the hospitals here are full, and I can't afford to go see her. 

I hate this fucking state. I hate CenterPoint. I've been left here to die and nobody gives a shit."

1.  Check the main post often for new information. 


2. Don't be in a hurry to completely restock your refrigerator once you get power. 


3. Think about your placement of your generator.

4. For the sake of your sanity and overall well-being, get out of the house and socialize with friends, or simply go out.

Lost power at 827 AM Monday. Restored Sunday at 1:22 PM. Much love to the out of state guys who came and restored our nested outage after a couple neighbors flagged them down. They got a well earned assortment of shitty light beer from me.

77096. No power. Near Herod.
"77069 no power. We saw a bunch of utility trucks though. My husband talked to them and we *may* get power by the end of the day.Supposedly they were having formans going through the area. It’s insulting that the centerpoint map shows our neighborhood is energized, but yet I’m still sitting in a very hot house and no electricity.

As much as I appreciate my neighbors hospitality, I can’t wait to sleep in my own bed."
"I got power back Thursday night, thank god. Something I didn’t consider was my doctor sending in a prescription renewal to my usual Walgreens, which still doesn’t have power, and I 
 can’t transfer it to another Walgreen’s location without having the doc send in a whole new renewal to that location.  

I’m sitting here wondering if it’s worth the hassle to call my doctor and get them to help or just wait it out. It’s the Walgreens at Shepherd & Feagan, which is in the light green on the map. I’ve got some extra meds and it’s not a life or death medical issue so I’m very lucky in that regard. I feel like a real dummy for not thinking of this when I requested the renewal in the first place."
"Got shocked pretty bad by my refrigerator after power came back on yesterday.  NOT fun.  

Not sure what caused it but it’s going in the trash."
"77092 near 290 & Bingle Road. Power is back on! They said we’d be out until Wednesday (07/17) but came on today around 7pm or so. Please don’t give up hope. This shit was rough and I’m hoping it comes on soon for everyone else. 

Always & forever fuck CenterPoint."

No Power; Oak Forest 77018 - Chantilly & Rosslyn
77070 most of my neighbors have power as of yesterday but they found another downed line last night. Hoping for today. Exhausted and brain is foggy from lack of sleep. Plan for today is to finish throwing away food and scour the fridge/freezer.

update: i finally have power 🥹"

Lots and lots of Bucket Trucks in and around my neighborhood! 5 were staged in the little league field.  Hopefully we get power in the next few hours."
77379- across from Klein high school. Power turned on this morning!!! Hallelujah
"An update for my 77092 peeps near 43rd, TC Jester and Watonga. I drove by our house and saw a couple of vegetation crews at the corner of 43rd and Watonga gearing up to work on a big tree that was leaning against a power line right there at the corner. I didn't see any huge damage to the pole itself but I have an untrained eye. Hopefully that was one of the only big holdups for people in our area. Obviously Centerpoint needs to come by after that to do their thing but it's a sign of progress.

Edit: Had some friends drive by to check. Trees on the corner have been trimmed and they said they saw work trucks near Viking and Mall, not sure if Centerpoint or otherwise. Hopefully that brings some hope to some of yall!"
77007. North of I-10 and TC jester. Had power for a day and then it went out again Thursday.. other houses on our street have power but we and some others of our closest neighbors don’t. I’ve been pretty patient but the anger is starting to set in
77379- nothing since the hurricane and not projected to have power until Tuesday. Sigh.
77379 - still no power. Map said the 17th yesterday but now says energized. I am definitely not energized.

77090 still now power and I am loosing my fckin mind
"77009 - My power was supposed to be on the 12th, then the 13th, then today. We had linemen 8 blocks south of us yesterday and now they're nowhere to be fine. Centerpoint's map shows us as ""energized with localized outages"" which is straight bullshit because there are 60 or so houses out because of this one downed line and transformer. I've fucking had it with centerpoint. They're a scam of a company that's forced on us with no competition at all. A monopoly beholden only to its shareholders. 

When I called again today, they contacted dispatch and basically said ""yeah we don't know when we'll get to that"". Fuck centerpoint."
"77018- We are listed as energized with potential nested outages, our community  and surrounding areas do not have power.  We were walking the neighborhood and saw two trucks at a house, the minute a droplet of rain went down they got the hell out of dodge.  That's the only droplets of rain btw,  I am spamming Centerpoint with outage reports every hour and calling them and they keep saying they have a person assigned and in route, but nothing else."

" Day 7 of no power

Yesterday I finally got sick and tired of it and tried to drum up a little mini-campaign to get a tree off a power line. I know at least 5 of us were calling repeatedly yesterday, maybe more. Initially when speaking to Centerpoint, they said they didn’t have a crew available to cut the tree down and didn’t know when they would but they were aware of it… fishy. I called back and asked for updates a few more times yesterday to keep the heat on them, and then later that evening we finally had an ETA of 7/16 on getting power back. Bummer that it was going to be three more days, but I was happy to have anything other than “pending”. 

Wouldn’t you know it, there are ten trucks out there this morning and the tree is being dealt with. 

All of this to say, don’t underestimate the power of multiple people calling and keeping pressure on them to prioritize your area. Try to get your neighbors to call multiple times. Make sure you mention if your issue is affecting a school or a public park where kids might spend time. Don’t give up!

**Update**: we have power!! Advocate for yourselves people!!"

77009 near Montie Beach park. Map says we are energized. Neighbors have power but I guess the 3 blocks behind them including me do not have power. I’ve seen box trucks around the neighborhood all day today but I still can’t get my hopes up. I’m tired y’all.
77037… July 19th… who do I sue?
"No power still but I was able to refill 2 of my propane tanks at Northtown Auto Center on Shepherd.  $12 for each 20lb tank.  There was a massive propane tanker delivering when I got there and no one waiting so I was in and out in like 5 minutes.  They close at 5 today if anyone needs some.  Shepherd wasn't bad traffic wise, most of the lights are working"
Got the message that power's back on at work and as much as I'd love to take advantage of the electricity and AC over there I don't think I'm capable of doing anything but staring at a wall so now I guess I have to decide if I really want to waste PTO just to sit in the heat with no power 🫠
My neighborhood of the outskirts on the edge of oak Forest just got electricity
"77024 and still now power despite estimates that it would be back last night. 

Centerpoint needs to be broken up or nationalized immediately. Going on a full week without power after a Cat 1 is an inexcusable level of incompetence. These idiots couldn’t manage a hot dog stand. "

"77024 Hunter's Creek Village. Got it back yesterday a little before 6 pm. We were slated for yesterday, so I am glad they were able to actually do it. 

My in-laws live off Mockingbird and Flintrock in Bunker Hill Village. We have offered them to come over, but they say they don't want to impose. They have a gnarly tree that is still down, and Centerpoint has told them it could be weeks because of how bad the trees and lines are. It requires a special team to come out. The Village police and fire have needed to put out notices because residents keep coming into the stations and fire houses asking when they are going to do anything. People, if the lines are live, people can die. Don't harass others or try to do it yourself.  Sadly, a lot of this has become hurry up and wait and a lack of transparency from Centerpoint, yet again. 

If you go out in public today, don't be an asshole. 

EDIT: In speaking to my MIL this morning, they are now being told Tuesday."
"I've had power for a few days. Just got a call from Centerpoint saying that ours was an especially challenging issue and we would not get power back until next Friday.

77092 - Nina Lee and Costa Rica. No electricity. Received 3 notifications last night that it is being worked on and will be restored but alas still no power. Hopefully today is the day! 🤞🏼
"77069 eta was yesterday. Still don’t have power

Edit. I know others around us have their power restored. We won’t have ours on at least for another day. Had a fire around the corner and the linemen went to another job site."
"77008 near Oxford in the Heights. No power and ETA is now 17 July end of day (Wednesday). CenterPoint rep on Friday said crew assigned Friday 5:40pm with expected arrival 11:30pm same day.   Obv a false sense of hope. Maddening as two door’s down they have power (their pole runs down Colombia St).  

Also have roof leak and ceiling repairs needed, so contractors having a rough time with remediation."
"77021 - Ozark Street- Still no power on our side, but our neighbors across the street have had power since Tuesday. My parents are both 70 plus."
77020. Power just went out. I hope it’s for fixing something downstream
"For those of you seeing the map claiming you're energized when you don't have power, give the map a bit more time to load and you may see the color change. I opened the map a bit earlier to look and it said I was energized despite not having power. I was staring at it in furious disbelief and then decided to take a screenshot to send to my friends to complain. In the minute or two it took me to decide that, the map changed and said I would be up on 7/17. So I think it's just really laggy to load when zooming in."

77386 finally got power yesterday
77373 no power day 7 🫠
has anyone gotten their power back on today? 77039 and haven't gotten mine back despite there being power the block over
"For my in-laws at 77069/champions area, it said they had power today with the lunchtime tracker update (were due to get it back Wednesday according to the tracker). I told them it probably was false since they didn’t get a notification. They drove over there and still had no power. So they are now even more disappointed. Hopefully it’ll be back on by Wednesday or before."
77053 our electricity went out...
Anyone in the meyer forest apartment complex on 77096 got any updates as far as when power will be back or seen any trucks heading that way?
Hope the cleanup is going well and productive. I’m probably visiting in a few weeks.
77008 Any info on W.26 and Lawrence? Looks like every one around that area has power but not our area
77080 finally back on for now.
"77006, near Montrose/Bomar. Got power around 6:30pm today."
"77074 altamond sangamon ln our entire neighborhood has power except us(10-20 houses), we should be in the nested area and I pretty sure they forgot about us… 

This is really depressing especially when you see your neighbors has light and you don’t….

Fun facts, I called center point about my outage and the live call lady hung up on me after I gave my address. I don’t even know what to say anymore lmao…"
77345 they claim my area is energized but nothing in the general surrounding apartment complexes or businesses (until further down West Lake Houston) have power.
"77036. Finally have power back at Forum Park. That was a long week. Fuck Centerpoint. Fuck Greg Abbott. Fuck Dan Patrick. Fuck the crosswinds in Butler, Pennsylvania"
Live in the Greenspoint Service area. We’re the only area with over 100k remaining without power. Fucking sucks
"77026

Power back online. However it seems to be “pulsing” on and off certain hours of the day. This shuts off the A/C and router repeatedly. The most it happened was 4 times in one hour. Is this an area issue or could it be personal home issue/our power lines on street?"
"77389 Northhamptom FINALLY has Power and the sweet, sweet taste of the Internet.  I'm gonna hurt myself with the amount of porn I'm going to watch."
Mattress Mack getting after Centerpointless. Love to see it.
"77459

At this point I give up, they shifted the date so many times, I'm certain that they wont be done til august. I'm not waiting that long. At this point I'm just going to skip town. I've been putting it off for a while, but living in a situation that is essentially a third world scenario has put me in a position where I would have no chance.

this stinking city and state has taken everything, my life, my health, my dignity. left me with nothing. and now they have put me in a position where a fucking thunderstorm leaves me in the dark for a whole fucking week. 

fuck it, I got nothing to lose."
I’m never getting power back.  Parts of shepherd are pitch black at night including a whattaburger and Centerpoint told us to eat cake
"77021, near Scott and OST. We are lucky in that we have had “partial service” since Monday, so we’ve been able to charge devices, have the fridge available, run fans, and power a portable A/C unit for the bedroom. Of course, the A/C system is one of the things offline and even with fans and such the air in the house is getting very stuffy and humid. We’ve been able to keep the temp in the 80s in the house by opening windows overnight, which has definitely helped.

Our whole side of the block and the homes backing up to us on the next block over are in the same situation with limited power and no A/C.

A CenterPoint technician was across the street yesterday to address a downed live wire and stopped by real quick to check the lines when we mentioned the issue. He confirmed that the 120V phase was running but the 240V was only pushing about 98V, hence the issue. He speculated that it was a transformer issue or some other problem in the line running behind our house.

He said that it was a “low priority” issue with other repairs underway even though the whole side of the street was affected, which I honestly understand but is frustrating. My biggest concern is that our situation is at super low priority and could take longer to address.

Big shout out to the technicians and linemen working to get everything back online. CenterPoint’s bungling of this emergency response is out of their hands, and I’m sure many of them are frustrated with the situation as well."
"77004, midtown, 288/McGowen

No power even though the map said it would be fixed yesterday"
"There is no power for us at 77042 after 2 days of half of my complex getting power. I want to scream, 7 days away from home, living out of a suitcase, I feel like a burden."
"77099 here. Got power back Wednesday night, but lost it yesterday around noon, and still out now. What’s up with that? 😑"
77070 Louetta & Cutten. Power was supposed to be on YESTERDAY! But still nothing. It’s hot and miserable.
"No power here. But, across the street? Yes, we are on separate feeds and our power comes from rear of the property between yards. Fucking sucks ass. Day 7. Abbot is speaking today, time for a good protest against the little piss baby."
"77571 - Still powered up but I couldn't sleep last night to enjoy it. The generators been off since 11am yesterday and I can still hear it when I close my eyes. Got an email late last night saying Centerpoint may need access to my yard to fix a neighbors isolated outage.

I am keeping all the emergency supplies in place and a new generator being delivered Monday so I have two gennys and two AC's. They will never do this to me again."
77044- no power
"Still have a down live line. Still no one even assigned to it. We are very fortunate to be in a hotel for now, but not sure for how long. The thought of facing another week with no end in sight and also now having to be at work every day and meet deadlines is already so exhausting after a full week of heightened sense of anxiety and fight or flight. Hope everyone gets their power (and lives) back soon."
77336 atasocita/ lost power Monday got it back Tuesday morning/ map says we have no power
"77070 8 of the complex buildings and all surrounding ones got power back yesterday morning, centerpoint map says we all will get power on 17th lol."

77030 days my apartment building has power but it doesn’t
77055 had a end of the day noticed but they changed it to pending after 6 hours of having so you know. Quite accurate on that part.

Discovered the 30+ year old cooler that my parents got when I was a kid is too old to hold ice anymore. Got an RTIC at Lowe's and now I'm good to go again."
"77584, Southdown with nested outage again! At this point I'm losing hope"
"77074 Bellaire/ tarneff area, we're still without power. It's extremely infuriating, and there is nothing we can do. I least I got a generator yesterday and we got fans running."
77039 lights are back on for now
annnd we're back off smh

77033 off Cullen.. no power but it map says we're energized...I keep reporting an outage tho. Couch surfing for now but miss my cats :(
"77346, no power since 5:30am last Monday. No real eta"
77077 no power yet but trucks in the neighborhood.  Map went from showing Tuesday restoration to “energized with potentially local outages.”  Not holding my breath.  They actually had it back on Thursday but then a transformer got hit by lightning when the storm rolled through and right back off again within 30 minutes.
77346: Atascocita South neighborhood just got power.
"77373 - Fairfax Village - No power since Monday 0630.

I've temporarily relocated to Brenham and I come down to check the house every couple of days. Thoroughly annoyed with Centerpoint and their outage map."
77029 Clinton park. Got it last night at 8ish. According to yesterday’s map we were expected to get on the 16th 😭
77007- memorial Birdsall area got power!!

Nested outage 77082 whole apt has power but 6 buildings.  Called CP last night and was told power would be on last night. Still nothing.

77080 we got power back last night around 8pm. Saw crews in Binglewood this morning

77388 cypresswood near 45. Still nothing so far.  Probably will actually be Tuesday by the time power is restored.

77064 - still no power. West/bw8
"77023: no power; Pearson and Broadmoor. 

Half the houses have power the others do not. Map says we are energized. Real worried this will last til next Friday

Edit: Saw no linemen in my area today after having seen 6 or so around Scott rd and one on telephone and Dumble. They may be assigned elsewhere


**EDIT2**: power restored at 8pm today. Saw no linemen at all in the area, what causes this outage? It seems so bizarre. Out of 12 homes, 4 homes in a row were knocked out while everything else was powered."
What does it mean if a crew has been assigned to our area? Not sure if that’s good/bad/meh
77084 park row is sitting in the dark in a nested outage. Awful.
Just go down to your local federal government to get help.
"77345, Day 7 no power."
77068. Power came back on last night.

Edit2: Good news guys, your good vibes and energy have helped me secure a place to stay now the power is back. Please, please, please, don't forget to show some love to the amazing people at the Waffle House on Westheimer and Willcrest (closest intersection). They went far and beyond  to help my dog and me get to a safe place. Some asshole broke one of their windows (presumably last night) and even with that they are all high spirited bringing their crews to work and getting ready to feed all the night owls out there.

The fact we’re on megathread V due to this incompetence is insane.
Must have some sort of PTSD from this experience. I kept waking up middle of the night with fear the power went out. Woke up this morning and still had power. Been on for 14 hours now. 77025
So this has been horrible. I would like power and water please. Will settle for one.
I miss the healthy relationship I had with my toilet before the snowpocalypse.
Feels weird today
60+ hours with no power. No water for about 30 hours now. Absolutely no timeline or answers. Where are these rolling blackouts? I am so over this.
"I know I'm just some random guy on the internet, but I have a buddy that works in emergency management for the City of Houston and he claims that they're going to try to bring a significant portion of non-functioning water supply back online today.

"I've seen reports of people approaching centerpoint crews to question them. Please don't do that, let them work so they can get power back on"
Just realized that we could just use the pool water from the apartment complex to flush.
Ambulance just came to take my mom to the ER. No power since Monday. She hasn’t been able to do her nightly dialysis treatment. Can’t even put into words the amount of rage I feel towards the fuckers that caused this shitshow. It didn’t have to be like this but profits are more important than a working system.
Watching the Centerpoint percentage feels like election night
CenterPoint just stated that rotating outages are done for now
"I hope this damn freeze at least killed off a lot of mosquito larvae. We always hear about how our winters don’t get cold enough to kill a lot of the larvae. Okay biologists, here you go. Here’s a perfect cause and effect study for you to confirm your theory."

But, Kenny the whippet and company finally have some heat. Trying to heat it up so it’ll be warm if/when we go Amish again.
Hoping the water comes back on so I can shower before work, but I’m a NICU nurse, so at least the babies aren’t too judgy about having a dirty nurse. They’re just mad at me for taking their temps and all the things.

Thank you to everyone who wanted to help us out. I hope everyone’s power comes on and stays on and we all can stay warm!

Edit: my bill is only $35.17 per month so I'm wondering if they are capping the credit at 2 days if your bill is only $35. Because essentially by claiming two days you get a month free. Just a thought."
Bought water at Phoenicia downtown and they charged individually per bottle even when I bought the dozen packs. Thought it would be cheaper to buy in bulk but it’s like buying bottles one at a time. A 12 bottle box of Topo Chico was 23 dollars! Isn’t this illegal?
What about the accusation that the outage is not about the inoperablilty in the cold weather but that power plants “unplugged” because if not their profits would be impacted? Is this accurate?
Centerpoint still going up slowly at 53.5% I've gotta be honest I'm a little excited and trying so hard not to get my hopes up.

Is #FuckERCOT trending yet?
53.42% from Centerpoint. Keep in mind previous day was 49% around this time. Kinda happy that there is progress but sad it's so slow.
If power ends up coming on tonight then by god I am staying up until it turns back off. Then I can powernap through the outage like a big brain.
"Now that I'm back in the thread with power gone once again, just wanted to say thanks to all y'all for keeping me sane during these long outages. There doesn't seem to be any sense of fairness as to who's getting power and for how long, so I'm really hoping for some of y'all that haven't had any relief will get it soon. And now I wait for my 4G to deteriorate and the cold to creep back into my apartment. At least I got to take a shit with the lights on."

In 30 minutes we’ll hit 72 hours straight without even a flicker of power. Outage tracker being at 95% resolved is insane to me. Prioritizing the return of power to those who’ve gone without it the longest was clearly a bunch of bullshit. I’m so tired of this.
It feels wrong having power. I feel wrong charging my shit and trying to get my house warmed up. What the actual fuck has the last 3 days without power done to me. I’ve only plugged in the essentials for charging and put the heat to 62 and I still feel bad

"The “winter storm” that hit us on Monday is gone,  now it’s just another wet day in the 30’s that aren’t uncommon for even a Houston winter, the fact that we still don’t have power shows how fragile our infrastructure really is, people in state leadership should step down, this happened on their watch.  A screw up this big in any private sector job and you’d be fired I don’t think this should be any different."
"Center Point said they were rotating the blackouts to give people power intermittently rather than have no power at all, yet I was put on a planned blackout around 10:30pm yesterday, and it hasn’t turned back on despite their website showing the planned outage in my area stopped."
I would pay hundreds of dollars for my water back. I’d take no power if it gave me water. Ugh
53.93% from Centerpoint! A whole 5% increase over yesterday.

Now we need a  water tracker.."
Oh my god this is getting so exhausting. Barely sleeping in the past few days isn’t helping matters. Centerpoint just sent out an email asking everyone who has power or gas to please conserve. I’m so fucking tired it feels like my eyes are on fire.

"so, the centerpoint energy tracker is showing almost 74% of customers with power. That is up about 20% from just this afternoon. Hopefully those with power can keep it and those without can get theirs back soon and this whole thing can end. It's been a trying half week but we are seeing light at the end of the tunnel."
"Currently at 75.27% from Centerpoint with 653k people without power. 

Half way to 100% from yesterday and less than half as many people without power today as yesterday. Keep your heads up."
"The power is currently on and the house is warm, but the water has come to a complete stop. It hasn't dipped below 32F tonight, so I seriously doubt the pipes froze. Do you think I should shutoff the water or wait?"
"If anyone else is still without power (like me, 72+ Hours), I’m told we fall into one of 3 categories: (1) large scale industrial facilities that voluntarily went offline to reduce load; (2) areas affected by ice storm damage/downed lines that need to be repaired; or (3) areas taken offline to shed load that cannot be reenergized without sending technicians to manually reenergize the lines.

I assume we’re mostly all in the 3rd category and won’t see power return until a bunch of centerpoint trucks are in our respective areas to manually do it?

 Not great..."
"Jumping in on the chorus of being desperate for a shower.

Something burst inside our attic on Tuesday morning. We came home from spending Monday night somewhere warm to a waterfall of warm water. Water is completely off because we couldn't get a plumber out here and whoever built our house made that part of the attic completely inaccessible. Better yet, it has a separate water shut-off we had no idea about that is completely different from the main shut-off. This is our first house, only second year in here, and now there's a new feature installed in our master bathroom ceiling where we get a fun view of roof from inside 🥲 

I can't forget the sound of our smoke alarm going off as water was pouring out of the ceiling and out of our house. If I'm just sitting here, I still hear it. 

I'm counting my blessings that it's one room and we currently have power. Sunday and Tuesday were rough with a two month old pomeranian puppy and no power. [Dog tax](https://imgur.com/a/aZOBeqj)."

What in the actual fuck is going on here? How has state govt not climbed up ERCOT’s ass about this?

"77043 Royal Oaks checking in. Power restored just now. I know it probably won’t last, so we are charging anything and everything and I’m making hot coffee.

No water whatsoever.

My sister in law lives in Cypress and got hers yesterday around 10am. Hers has been off and on ever since. 

I’m enjoying this moment while I can cause I know it’s most likely not gonna last long.

It’s been depressing to say the least. Our state’s leadership (and I call it that loosely) needs to be held accountable for this bullshit. People have lost their lives due to this. Others (like my husband and I) can’t work, even remotely, due to lack of power and internet connection. So.... no money coming in. I’m sure this is the case for many of y’all too. 

This is a massive failure of epic proportions.

Eldridge/Briarforest : Kroger is closed

Dairy Ashford/Briarforest : Kroger is open (long line outside so skipped it)

Dairy Ashford/Memorial - Randalls Looked to be open with line outside

Walgreens at Dairy Ashford and Memorial- Was open (this is where I went) - the line is indoors, but they only have juice and soda!

~~CVS at memorial and eldridge looked to be open but I skipped it~~

all the regular convenience stores and many other smaller places such as the kiosks at gas stations were all closed

"50.92% have power according to Centerpoint right now. 

This is HIGHER than yesterday's peak which was 49%. It doesn't say much for those who haven't had power for more than two days in a row but it's certainly progress. Hopefully we can see even higher soon enough."

By the way, Centerpoint outage map is above 51% and ERCOT capacity/load graph has a massive gap between load and capacity, so it seems like things are looking better for the moment. Let's hope it holds."

"If your flush is not working there are 2 work arounds if you still have low pressure water or some water. 


1. Pour around half a gallon or so water in the toilet bowl it flushes automatically. Dump all water at once so that it has some nice flow. Slow pouring won't work.


2. OR you can open the tank and fill the water till the level indicated or till the water line and flush as normal."

I can’t tell you how frustrating it is to see so many closed businesses with full on exterior lights, neon signs, and parking lots lit up.  And neighborhoods with power, that seems like every light on the house is on.  Seriously people, we are in an energy supply crisis.  If you aren’t in the room, can you shut off the lights? Does your porch light really need to be on right now?  I realize it’s not much, but it all adds up and could probably turn on a neighborhood or two and maybe even save a life. So much waste right now, it baffles me."
"“The best-case scenario is that outages will be reduced to no more than 30 minutes to an hour at a time later today or tomorrow, officials said during a phone call with reporters.

They’re literally just saying anything to get off the phone with reporters. Yeah, the best case scenario is that we’re going to get the power working so well tonight it will actually go back in time and prevent anyone from being cold the past couple of days! Alternatively, the power will never work for the rest of our lives. But we’re keeping an open mind moving forward."

Fuck Rick Perry too"
"Although I don't care for Michael Barry, I was listening to his radio program this morning. I'm not surprised that the ERCOT board members don't even live in Texas. 

In a more humane and civilized society, the people responsible would be taken behind a building a shot. 

Meanwhile power is still out in 77019."
"My mom in her 70's alone with her pets in 77077 and has been without power since early AM on Monday has entered the ""they're doing this to Austin and Houston on purpose because we vote democratic"" thought phase."
Just roamed around and collected water in a bucket for toilet flushes if needed. Texas is in my top 10 favorite third world countries.
"Gregg Abbott should resign

Scott McClelland should take his place.

HEB has repeatedly done more for me than Abbot ever did.  

That said, the reason McClelland and HEB are so wonderful is exactly the same reason he would never go for a governership."
"ERCOT Q&A session live on channel 2 right now 

They’re saying that winterization standard are 100% voluntary. So there is zero regulation on this point for the private companies that supply Texas its power as it stands today.

Edit: completely dodged the question about why a 3rd of the board resides out of state

Edit 2: ERCOT did an assessment of its preparedness of winter power needs. They looked at what demand would have been for 2011 and adjust it for economic growth. Their models did not expect the amount of demand we have seen over the last few days (surprise!). No real input on where they went wrong. I’m sure that will be investigated at a later date. I’m not going to hold my breath for an honest answer. Call your state reps people. Demand answers. Real answers. Stay engaged and follow through otherwise this will just happen again.

Edit 3: additional follow up questions on why more wasn’t done to be prepared. They keep saying there is a national standard that was sent out to providers. But again that nothing was regulated. Small hint that might change by adding “yet” to the end of their response. I think that is just a personal opinion of these two individuals.

Edit 4: they were asked what source of power is the one causing the biggest loss of power to our grid. They didn’t give a straight answer. Side note - ERCOT tweeted that it was Natural gas yesterday. I’ll try to find that tweet later.

Edit 5: asked why windmills were not winterized and why it wasn’t mandatory and if there was a path to make it mandatory. Answer - “investors” did not purchase the package to have windmills operational in extreme cold temps. They “expect” regulation to become mandatory. 

Edit 6: list of our system is designed to operate in hot temps during the summer so not a lot of building and protection from cold weather because that would cause overheating during the summer. 

Edit 7: No clear timetable on a return to power. They are trying to rotate more to help those without power for a long time. Just depends on the weather and our power generation facilities thawing out. Optimistic that will happen over the next few days.

Edit 8: last question - why should we trust ERCOT to lead us out of this situation. He said don’t have confidence in us, have confidence in the people out in the field (assuming the private power generator companies) to get us out of this.

Final Edit: Two official were answering the questions. One was The CEO Bill Magness, I can’t find the details on the second. KPRC will summarize the session on their website. They were pretty critical of the situation and some of their answer but please take anything they out on their website with a grain of salt. Again, demand answers from you Texas State Legislator reps. This is not a local government issue. The mayor and the city are powerless on this issue. Demand real answers and independent investigation by knowledgeable professionals. Good luck folks, stay warm!"
"Dear diary 
It’s day 3 of the snowpocalypse . Went 55 hours without electricity and just as long without taking a shower . Power has come back on this early morning but now I live in fear of the moment it will shut off again. The worst part is that it’s only Wednesday. We shall see what tonight brings ."
Shout out to all those with power who HAVE turned down their thermostats and have altered their activity to save as much electricity as possible. Thanks for helping when/where you can.
"Next idiot who blames this on wind towers is going to get fucking slapped.

I am so mad. Out here trying to get formula and wet wipes and there are 40-50 people outside of every grocery store, meat market, CVS, etc. Where the fuck is the government"

Koi pond update. [Rip my plants](https://ibb.co/k49TxR1).
Still without power @77007 since 8:30pm last night. I went out to collect rainwater and my neighbors looked at me like a crazy person. On the plus side I've built a baller blanket fort that would've made 10 year old me jealous. Can't wait to show the fiancée when she gets off work
Halal Guys on 610/Ella Blvd. is open if anyone is looking for food right now!
"77006 Montrose, South of Westheimer and Taft

Power back on after 30 hours! Looks like Centerpoint truck was nearby and fixed the issue"
"Hey everyone... 77043 checking in again. Just wanted to give y’all an update about grocery stores....

The Kroger at the corner of Gessner and Hammerly was open today. We got there around 3pm. Long line, but it moved quickly. By the time we reached the door, they told us they would be open for only 15 more minutes, no eggs, meat, or milk would be made available to anyone under any circumstances and only ONE water product per person. They are definitely trying to ration things. 

We got some Gatorade and a 2 gallon pack of water.
Fruit was fairly plentiful. They did have bread, chips, and soup. They also have power bars. I saw pasta sauce too (can make soup with it). They had some cheese as well. 

I would get there early tomorrow if you’re in the area, especially if you want milk, eggs, or meat or water. It will most likely continue to be rationed but it is there. 

I haven’t made it to either HEB yet (Bunker Hill at I-10 and the one off Gessner), but if any of you have and can give a report, I’d love to hear what’s going on there. 

I hope y’all are all doing as well as possible. This is effing BRUTAL."
"77019, just got power back after 36 hours. Wishing everyone the best. Let’s hope they start rotating better.

Update: just lost power after a good run. Hopefully they’re rotating it more often now."
At work in the hospital. My husband just texted me to let me know they restored power again to the row of beach houses across the street where no one really lives year round and paid our neighborhood dust. Again. 77554

"people that i know that are losing power (for the first time), are experiencing very short blackout times like less than an hour, one was about 20 minutes. 

We finally got the lights back on after about 36 hours and i'm mentally and physically prepared for it to go out for God forbid, a significant amount of time again but their experiences give me hope."
73% have power much much better than last night which was 39%
"77493, Williamsburg parish area. 

Thanking my lucky stars to have held onto power this long (since 3pm) made pizzas in the oven for lunch, took a hot shower, and charged all my portable chargers.

As I am typing this comment, we just lost power @ 10:56 

I had a good run."

Not having the beltway open is maddening. The side roads are so fucking backed up. Is this just because they don’t have power to charge everyone? Cuz there is no ice in there at all. Smh

"Is anyone else coming up on the last day they can hold out?
I’m finishing the last of my dishes, food, ice and “water supply”.
I don’t understand why they can’t get some decent resolution today/tomorrow or at least call in some help.

I’d love to go grocery shopping/pay for supplies I just don’t have a car ."
"Centerpoint passed 60%! 11 points higher than yesterday. My hopes are high now and there's no turning back.

"Are these actually rolling outages now? We’re in 77043, were without power for 44 hours, and had it for about 7. Now that it’s off again, I am trying to figure out if this is a limp-along situation or if we need to go back into apocalyptic mode (we’re trying to keep aquariums alive)."
I just want to shower. Maybe i should stand in the rain...yes i know it is cold.
77546 lost power again. It was on for 30 mins after almost 42 hours. FML

"Finally reached 50% people with power, hopefully the trend continues up."
"77096, got power today at 7 after 36 hours without, just lost it again. At least we have a warm house and charged all the stuff.

Mcdonalds and whataburger are open on san felipe/voss and westheimer/voss respectively. I heard it takes about 20 minutes to get food.
Approaching 42 hours without power at 77024. Just an hour would be nice. Battery on its last leg.
"77082 just went down after about 13hrs.

Was grateful for how long the lights been on for me. Got to watch a couple of shows and eat warm food. Time to go back to crying myself to sleep in the dark and freezing cold again, until the next time I see lights.

Update: Came back on after an hr, thankfully!"

"77008 Timbergrove. Completely lost water early yesterday, so I shut main off and opened all faucets to drain. Turned water main on this morning. A trickle downstairs, nothing upstairs, so not much we can do with it. Turning main back off and draining faucets in preparation for tonight’s freeze. I’ll try again in 24 hours."
Should we be concerned that the ercot.com supply and demand curves are heading for intersection within a couple of hours?
still no power. 77081
"Costco Galleria is closed for the day. HEB Buffalo Speedway is probably out of stock cause there were 200 ppl in line at 10am. HEB Montrose didn't have power and they're tossing all their refrigerated stuff, very limited supply of anything. Same with Kroger Buffalo Speedway. 

So if you're in the loop, might need to go further out."
Whole neighborhood has power except 4 of us... I am one of the four. Day 3 and change here. Not enjoying this.

"As we cross the 80% threshold (according to centerpoint's website), just a reminder to everyone. If you get your power back refrain from blasting your heat at max. There might still be a risk that the system could get overwhelmed again. We're not through this yet, and we've made some progress. But keep in mind the other 20% who are still without power. Do it for them."

"77008- so some apartments in the complex have power, others (including mine) don't. People gathering in the common area for warmth and electricity since it has power. Luckily we've rented a storage closet next to our apartment and it has power. So we plugged the extension cord, powerstrip and now able to charge our phones, an electric grill and the fridge.

The Randall's on Holcombe at Buffalo Speedway is open. There was no more milk or eggs but there was a variety of meats and produce. Quite a bit of canned soups and vegetables. I didn't go down the bread aisle so I don't know about that. There was no line to get into the store and the parking lot was crowded for that store but still had spaces. The Chick fil A in that center had a line that looped and looped and looped around the lot by the Barnes and Noble. If you're going to the Randall's don't turn-in near the Chick fil A.
"Where’s the nearest place NOT dealing with this? Should I head for OK or LA?

"We were stuck in Colorado due to this storm, just got home to a house with electricity, no busted pipes, and bourbon. Thankful that my inlaws watched over the house while we were away.

Driving down 59 to Sugar Land was disheartening, and there were times that we drove through areas that were obviously without power, and have been for some time. Drove past a work crew spraying a salt brine on the roads. Saw multiple fast food joints with lines WAY deep. no gas to be had anywhere, and we made it home with a touch of gas to spare. 

I just cannot believe that we live in Houston, in 2021, and this is an issue. It's not like a hurricane came through and destroyed infrastructure. I'm a pretty conservative leaning guy, and I hope that heads roll across the board.

—————————————

From one of our news reporters here in Houston. 

Wed, Feb 17, 2021 at 2:30am. 
Bad cell connection won't let me do a Facebook LIVE... so posting this for the latest info.

- As of 3:05pm Tuesday, CenterPoint Energy said they could not restore power to homes until more electricity is created. #ERCOT will not allow them to bring more customers back online. Centerpoint said customers without power should be prepared to have no power for several more days.

- These conditions in the electric industry mean we will likely start to see some retail electric providers (These are the companies you pay for electrcity.) go out of business. If your electric provider abruptly closes, you will be stuck with what's called the ""Provider of Last Resort (POLR)"" & a sky high electric rate of 25 to 30 cents a kilowatt.

 In an emergency meeting Monday, the Public Utility Council raised the price of wholesale electricity to $9000 a megawatt. That is what the retail electric providers pay to get it. You would pay about $9 a kilowatt. And if you are on a variable rate plan or your fixed rate contract expires and you go month to month... that is the rate you would be facing. That factors out to something like $450 a day for the average homeowner. Multiply $450 by 30... and that would be your electric bill for one month.

Some electric providers are telling customers to please leave... even offering $100 off their last electric bills to encourage customers to go somewhere else. This is because those companies didn't buy enough electricity to continue to give it to you for the price you agreed to pay. Basically, they ran out... and if they have to buy more now, the electricity will cost them $9000 a megawatt... but because you're under contract, they have to give it to you for pennies. Those businesses can't sustain that... and they will just go under. If you get an offer or warning from your electric company- take it.. switch now. You do not want to be stuck with a provider of last resort.

Right now on the Power to Choose website, there are only about 27 plans for Houstonians to choose from. Usually there are 100+ plans. If your contract is coming up soon, lock in a new one.

Yeah. It stinks. Prepare yourself ... and make sure you are locked in with a fixed rate. Even a high 15 cents a kilowatt right now is better than $9 a kilowatt."
"Wow, literally every grocery store, gas station, and pharmacy is closed right now inside the loop. Made it to Whole Foods in midtown right before closing and people are buying cans of sparkling water cause they’re so desperate. This is just awful."
"Holy crap. Centerpoint website says 94% area has power. It was around 45% Wednesday. Thats 133,000 without"
Cereal and no milk gang
My electric company charged me a late fee because I didn't/couldn't pay my bill on time...while my electricity was out. Nice.

77019 by shepherd & indiana just got power back about half an hour ago! 🙌 no idea how long it’s gonna last but so happy to warm up a bit!
77058 lost power. First time all week.
"We stopped at Kroger off Morton Ranch/99 in Katy. We decided to wait in line because it was manageable (lol) with about 30-40 people. When we left it was probably up to 100.





No produce, deli, dairy, meat or frozen foods are available. They’re thrown away or cordoned off to be thrown away since they lost power.





No water. The only water they had were the single bottles of LifeWater, Evian, SmartWater etc. So we grabbed ten or so of those liters.





Paper products are just about out too. Not sure when they’re getting deliveries of new stock in but with the amount of people still out of power and people whose power has come on and they lost their food id imagine the rush at grocery stores will continue for awhile.





Also - fast food places that were open yesterday around this 99/529 area are now closed. With the exception of Popeyes on Clay (about 60 cars waiting)."
"FUCK, just lost power in 77008 again"
77498 sugar land lost power for the first time at 7:30 pm tonight
"This may be “no shit” advice (and is predicated on having the ability to boil water), but we’ve been staving off cold by filling wine bottles with heated water. Radiates longer than plastic bottles, but be careful to not pour too hot of water too quickly."
77083 power came on at 8pm and turned off at 9:30pm. Lmao
Power on at 77006 montrose Richmond area
"After about 32 hours, have power back at 77006."
Just got power at 77007 (near yale) after it being off for 28 hours
Power back on in 77008. Timbergrove/Lazybrook.
"Just got this in a text from Centerpoint. 

“FROM: CenterPoint Energy

ERCOT has notified CenterPoint Energy of additional capacity. If you have power, please help your neighbor by conserving electric and natural gas so we can assist the most people. Text STOP to unsubscribe.”"
Probably gonna invest in a Sunrun or Enphase solar panel system. Fuck this.
"Powers back again. That was only 1.5 hour outage, shortest by far. This area might be actually doing some controlled rolling



Edit 77019"
77035 just got power back! 42 hours and change.
Anyone know whats going on with water? Haven’t had a drip of water since Tuesday afternoon in my apartment. Got power back last night
Has HPD always worn black and yellow uniforms? It gives me Watchmen vibes.
"I have water pressure, even though it's low. Do you guys think it's okay to take a shower? I haven't had one in 4 days and I'm really stinking right now."
Power still out in 77002. One of the remaining 0.62%
Found gas and water at Exxon gas station in Westheimer and Chimney Rock
Can’t find the comment now but just wanted to let you know that my family’s in 77076 (off 45 and Parker) and they finally got power back last night at 11pm and it hasn’t gone out yet
"So we have no pipes burst, but the toilet tank cracked and leaked on the bathroom floor. Doesn't seem so bad, no damage from what I can tell.

Toilet will need to be replaced, but at least its not pipes bursted"
Finally getting a tiny trickle through our faucets in 77007.
"I have a fixed rate energy plan, but I’m worried that the electric company and ERCOT will raise the delivery charge. Can they do that?"
So are rolling blackouts still in place? Power came on again at 10pm last night and have been on since then. Just not sure what to expect at this point.
Does anyone know what to expect with natural gas bills once this is all over? I understand the price of it has skyrocketed which I expect will be passed on to the customer. I've been keeping alive with my gas fireplace running 24/7. Should I expect a $1000 gas bill later?
Kroger on westheimer and Elmside has gas!
When can we expect water back? Any idea??

is it true that there’s more outages coming at 6?
77007 just came up at 5:39.
Doesn't seem like rolling outages to me. 77082 no power since 5:30  am . Perhaps 12 hours is just a quick rolling outages. Not mad though many others have been in much worst shape

Lost power for 36 hours and got it back a few hours ago - so incredibly grateful to be able to have a bit of heat and charge our phones. What are the odds we lose power again tonight? I’m afraid I know the answer already....
I-10/610 Memorial area out again after about 6-7 hours. It was nice. Hopefully they roll over to the folks who have been without for way too long.
"77006 / Montrose - I'm at the apartments at Dunlavy and w alabama. We got an email saying power nearby is back, but a blown transformer means we won't have power until tomorrow morning at the earliest.

Just a heads up for anyone nearby not to get your hopes too high."
"Centerpoint numbers keep improving,  73.96% now have power"

Anyone had power come on after having none and it just says on? Not trying to make people salty just wondering since it seems like the percentage keeps going up
Power is coming back for few seconds at 77007. I managed to extend my recliner and I feel awesome already!
"[e: removed], just lost again. Was really hoping the increasing CNP percentages meant we would make it the rest of the way. Man, every time the power goes on or off it's an adrenaline rush."
77083 - we back online after 2ish hours @10:51pm
[deleted]
"77007. Been coming on, staying on for 30 - 90 seconds, then power is gone again. Been happening intermittently over the last two hours. Lost power/water Tue ~9ish PM. 

Feels like the biggest cocktease ever."
Anyone been able to get water pressure back after not having it for a while?
77007 has power but no water
Has any statement been released about when water might one back online
"I'm in the heights  (77008) and my external water intake pipes cracked (despite insulation). I shut off the valve, but there is a minor leak drizzling out from the valve itself. No signs of internal damage, luckily -- but looks like someone may need to get into the wall to replace the pipes.

 I've tried calling / e-mailing 15+ plumbers but no luck so far. Looking for any help/advice."
"For those of you with burst pipes, what are your plumbers telling you as far as how long it's going to take to get fixed?

I called my usual plumber Tuesday morning and got on his list, but I just got an automated text from him that it could be as long as 3-4 weeks due to lack of supplies."
"77092.

57 hours ALMOST TO THE MINUTE and I officially have my power on! Keeping the thermostat low and instead using a heated blanket. Still no water. Stay strong y’all! We’re in this together!"

"Sucks ERCOT is a private entity controlling a public utility and they won't even share any info on how they intend to roll black outs and who will get power and when.

"77082. Power is out. AGAIN!! I can’t take this third world shit anymore man, it’s so ridiculous. Especially in the so called “energy capitol” of the world. 

Vote those fuckers who let Texas’ grid get so bad out! 

Sorry needed to vent..."
"Also I'm planning to move to Houston TX this summer, can't wait to vote out those who are responsible for this calamity."
"I know this has been said but this is absolutely ridiculous. It’s raining and 34 degrees - this is NOT extreme weather. How was Texas not prepared for this?! I lived in NY/NJ for over 30 years and never lost power for more than an hour. 
I’ve now been without power for 35 hours and without water for 18 hours."
Anyone got a list of those in charge of ERCOT? Who else is responsible?
"So I made this soup Sunday night. https://gfycat.com/physicalweeblueandgoldmackaw-lemon-garlic-chicken-orzo-soup-recipe

We have had on/off power for the last 24 hours and I heated a bowl on our gas stove for my grandmother in law. She refused to eat it. I tasted it and I am sure it's not spoiled, but sheesh lady this isn't the time to turn away hot meals...

Can't wait for the bottled FEMA water to arrive so we can all wait four hours in line for a 24 pack.

"77008- no power for 40 hours but it came back last night and holding on for now. 

No water at all. 

Hungry and really wishing I could order food or go to a drive through- but going to eat another PB&J. No water to cook with is such a pain."
Anyone's attic water heater pipes freeze or burst?
77009 going on 56 hours no power. Neighbors directly across the street have had power twice in the same timespan. Absolutely over this. Got down to 38 in the house last night. Centerpoint is doing a piss poor job of allocation.
Can I use Gatorade to flush my toilet? That’s all I have and I don’t have water left. I’m in an apartment complex with no real snow to gather.

"Water turned off in 77056 this am.  I spent 2 hours driving around to several gas stations and minimarts in search of water and could only find small bottles here and there. It's a good thing I like seltzer water.

47% have power not good enough but more are getting it back
"77077 power came back on at around 1 but still no water. Although I smell, I’m so thankful to be warm 👏🏼"
"77008 power back on, still no water. Not sure if rolling or not."
Anyone stick with Griddy? Would like to know what their prices look like.
Still no power in 77573. Going past 60 hours without it. But we managed to hook up our generator to our gas heater so we have heat now.
Anyone been to/from Dallas recently? I know it's supposed to get cold another night or two but do you think a drive to Dallas Friday afternoon would be doable?
"77081. Had power all day yesterday but water ran out around 9pm. Lights followed around 1. Turned on and off but officially haven’t had power since around 6am.

Zip 77008 power out again after being on for 14 hours. Still no water.
"In the past 48 hours I’ve had power for 2, and it was in the middle of the night last night.

So how long is this supposed to last?
"And just lost power again in 77098 after having it on for 7-ish hours. (Previously, it had been out 43 hours.) For reference, since not all zip codes are equally dark or lit up, we are near the Richmond and Shepherd intersection."

Power came back at 6pm but afraid it will go off again overnight. Does the 74ish% from cp mean permanent or temp service back?
"77057 - 56 hours off, 10 hours on, 1 hour off and now back again.  First time it came back, this morning, I had built a pillow fort and after falling asleep in it for an hour woke up with alarms going off and power back.  Now tonight I bring everything into the fort and as soon as I settle down power comes back.  The fates are conspiring to stop me from using it!!"
No power but I'm about to take a cold shower fuck this shit
"77007 near tc jester and i10. Just got power after 36 hours, feels amazing!"
77077. Back on after 24hrs. Hearing that Ercot is getting enough capacity online by tomorrow AM just to tell providers to start proper rolling blackouts. I hope that isn’t the case.
"Looks like Centerpoint is up 85%, it was around 70% at 2 in the evening."

Kenny is okay though since he has his new gummy bear toys. The other dogs are less amused at the lack of power and lack of wet food due to no power (minimize the dishes)."
Yay!!!  77019 power is back on!!!

"Guys that have a busted pipe, how are y'all getting water for toilets? I was collecting snow and runoff but my damn toilet demands so much water."
My apartment complex in 77019 has been out of power since Monday at 10 am. A transformer blew when power was restored to the complex and only some apartments are actually online. All other buildings around us have power

When I finally got someone on the phone, she said “well sorry I’m stuck in cypress with my two kids I’m a single mom.” Like, I’m not trying to not have empathy, but this is your job and you just... have to figure it out. This entire building is reliant on management and they’ve decided to deal with their own issues instead of help us."

"I got a slogan ""Stay inside or freeze and die."""
"77077. Lost power in the middle of the night, not sure when exactly, still out now. Starting Sunday night, I started losing water pressure. It got worse and worse until last night, when it stopped working all together.

Pretty sure I have food poisoning too. Can't flush my shit or puke without going to the apartment complex pool, jumping the fence and scooping water out to dump it my toilet to get it to flush."

Anyone else still holding strong with no power since Sunday night/Monday morning? I’m beginning to feel left out of the rolling aspect of this so could use some confirmation that others have also turned to solid ice.
"If you “just take snow, put it in your pot and turn the heat on,” said Wes Siler, a columnist with Outside magazine, “it’s going to take forever and waste a bunch of fuel.” Mr. Siler, who demonstrated his technique on a small outdoor stove, said it was more effective to melt a small amount of snow first. Then, once that is boiling, add more snow.

This step will “accelerate the process of melting snow tenfold,” Marty Morissette, an outdoor enthusiast, has said. (He said it may be because water transfers heat more effectively.)"
"Mitchiocana on Cypress Creek Parkway east near Treshwig was open this morning. Was able to score 2 dozen eggs and gallon of milk. Didnt need anything else so I didn't hoard buy.   They seemed to have plenty.  No bread tho.  Not even the Bimbo brand.

77043 we had power from about 1-10am but it’s off again. I know it doesn’t need to be said but this is just so fucking miserable.
Did anybody else lose cell service? Metro in 77373 lost it for a couple hours this morning and even then now it’s just a very weak signal.
"77338 power went off and water came back on and our upstairs apartment neighbors pipes burst and it all  down on us. Hardly got any sleep inbetween waiting for it to stop and bringing the buckets outside in the freezing Temps. Had to use clothes and towels to keep stuff dry..luckily none of our stuff outside of that and food are messed up, will definitely have to be relocated though"
I never thought my body would get sore from cranking cold generators all day. Keep those carbs clean. Had to fix 3 yesterday.
Just lost power in the Heights- 77007
77098 coming up on 48 hours no power or water. Temp in the house is about to drop below 50 degrees. We might have to drive across town to find someone to shelter us. Wish me luck
77008 is still down but others in my zip and 77009 had power for a while. How are y’all doing? Hope my block didn’t miss the roll somehow

"Trying to find gas has been a sh!t show, finally got gas from a station I passed up the first time cause lines were long, went to other gas stations and people were trying to pump from empty pumps. Finally circled back to the first station, waited my turn and got gas. As I drove around for maybe something to eat, I passed by that first station and saw it closed, no cars at pumps anymore. This was around Voss/San Felipe. Maybe we need to start another  thread on open gas stations that still have gas."
FYI heard from a neighbor that Bucees in Katy doesn’t have gas.
Buc-ee's in Texas City has gas. About a 100 car line though.
"Anyone know when the power will be back on for a while? We got electricity back at around noon, and it just shut off again. I have been unable to get any sufficient updates"
Heb on San Felipe (galleria/uptown) has quick moving lines! Starting to get picked over but you can definitely get some supplies for the next day or two
"Power just came back, first off for 48 hours, on for 4,off for about 3, 77479"
"77049 - BW8 and 90E - after 42 hours, power RESTORED as of 1pm Wednesday. Water on, as well. Got everything charged up and ready for the next round."
Does anyone know of people looking for volunteers? especially in league city clear lake area.

77098 here. Our apt building has some power. The elevators are running and the hallway plugs work but the individual units don’t have any power. Any reason for that?
Power back off in 77072. Great.
"77077 has had power since 11 am today, no telling when or if it’ll shut off. No water, people are taking water from the pool."
"Katy area along I-10 and 99 has several restaurants open. 

Texas road house is bumping."

"So if we’re at 70% does anyone know what this means? Are we getting power generation back online that will get us through to Saturday? Really hoping this is the case, been so rough these few days"
"Is it possible for an apt building to be on two different grids?? half my complex has power and my half doesnt, it’s maddening 😩"
77027 just lost power again.
"77006 Richmond and Montrose area just got power back, but no water. Might just be that water pumps in our complex need to be restarted."
Walking out to a dark neighborhood is pretty creepy. No light in sight.

Any update on the return of water in 77007?
"As of 2/17/2021 9:55:24 PM, CenterPoint Energy reporting 653984 Customers without power.

A lot better from the 1.4 million from lastnight at 11pm. I sincerely hope everyone gets power soon!"
Power at 77479 back on after five hours.
Power just came back on at 77008. Just some happiness here.
"So no need to drip faucets tonight in SW Houston area if we have electricity and running water with pressure, right? It just feels too good to be true and I have a feeling I will wake up in the middle of the night again just to realize the lights have gone out."
How do I know if my electric company is charging me the “surge” pricing?  Are they obligated to notify me?  Or is it just gonna show up on my monthly bill?  We have Reliant
Power just came back on for the third and hopefully final time at 77034. Just took me a nice hot shower...I needed it
"77005. Had power for 5 min today at 1:30pm. 0 power from 6:30pm Monday til now. 54 hours and counting. 

30% of my apt complex has lights on now. All the unused buildings nearby have power but we don’t. Unreal."

"My pressure vacuum breaker is leaking mass amounts of water from the bell, I have shut off the valves. Is it safe to keep it shut off for a bit while I attempt to fix whatever issue is causing the leak?"
Are the highways safe to drive now?
"My apartment building had a pipe burst, they're not giving much updates on the progress of the repair. Does this essentially mean that the water will be out for the whole building, regardless of city water pressure?

EDIT: in 77027"
Anyone know when the water will be back to normal? I think my works trying to open tomorrow and I have no clean work clothes. Don't mind wearing dirty clothes at home but pretty sure my job might care.
Still no water in 77008.
Where did the maga maggots get their talking point that windmills/green energy caused this?  I keep reading these comments and  they are repeating this in lockstep.   Fox?  Those Trump fuckers are like rodents.

"So nice of Greg Abbott to say that ERCOT needs to be investigated and the Texas grid needs some overhauling. In typical republican fashion of failing to do anything pre-emptively, and then promising change. Next step is to wait until everyone forgets this happened, then rinse and repeat."
"I'm a senior in college and until now I figured I'd leave Texas after graduation. But this, this makes me want to stay and drive all the incompetent and greedy bastards out of power and put the execs in prison. Maybe I'll stay"
"After reading reports of this same shit happening in 2011, and noticing that the state took NO precautions, and cares about profit over people ALL the time, and usually CAN'T/WON'T be held accountable, just makes me feel defeated.

Time to light the pitchforks and throw Greg abbot out a fucking window."

I’m trying to limit my electricity use but my work said now that you have power and internet either work from home or come to the office. I don’t want to go to the office all smelly so wfh it is. Sorry folks I have no choice.

So here’s a $2000 bill for February, no matter that you couldn’t go to work this week on top of a pandemic.”"
Is there a full transcript of that disaster of a Q&A by ERCOT?
"77098, the power finally came back on, but my cat just peed in our tomato plants we brought inside. I guess everyone is dealing with this disaster in their own way 😅"
Got power after 36+ hours without any !!!! Warming up my butt cheeks near vents and charging phones and battery packs...  Sending you POWER vibes.

We have water pressure back but we turned on the water to our house and found a burst pipe :/. At least it’s outdoors
"Posting only based on zip code is detrimental to this thread. Zip codes can include a lot of customers, and posting that a whole zip code has power again can have people return only to find they still don't have power.

"Ted Cruz having HPD meet him at IAH after he fucked off to Cancun is burning me up. So at least I feel warm from that. Fucking ridiculous. Blow his phone, mail box and email up y’all. God damn insane."
Pro tip: warm a hot meal asap as power comes on irregsrdless if barely hungry. Power will be gone as fast as it arrived.   Helps for moral.

I'm glad the power is coming back. But what about the water? Any news there? My power could go in and out all week but man I want to shower.
Centerpoint tracker says reliability is at 95.48%. Looks like most people are getting their power back. [Centerpoint Tracker](http://gis.centerpointenergy.com/outagetracker/)
Definitely getting a generator. Between predator 9000w and generac 8000w(300 bucks more) I see a lot of good reviews for predator. Generac is a well known brand but that’s for whole house gens idk about portables. Either way probably won’t be in stock til summer most likely
"Brazos town center in Rosenberg has Home Depot and grocery and fast food places open. Chick fil a as well.

Bucees on Crabb river road in Richmond and cvs are open. Riverpark (59/99) H‑E‑B is open but not chick fil a. Roads are fine throughout the area, some have a little snow left on the shoulders."

77003 here. Had power from 2AM until roughly 10 AM. We'd been without power for roughly 30 hours. Water is either a trickle or nothing at all.
Power just came on for the first time since Monday now. 77056
"~~*expunged*~~

**Monday**- Had no power all day from 2am onwards.

**Tuesday**- Regained power about 4am, I think we kept it most of the day but I'm not sure since we were out getting things we needed and looking for a 30v adapter for a generator. Lost power sometime late tuesday night, maybe about 9pm. Thought they were finally rolling power since it was out for maybe 45 minutes, but it went out again at 12am but came back about 3-4am. 

**Wednesday**: Power went back out about 8am-ish, then came back on for *less than 5 minutes* (utter bullshit that is) at about 9:45am. Still off."

Best of luck everyone!!!"
"77007 - power went out at 11:15 am and has just came back on. When it turned on again at 1:30 it went out again for 5 minutes and then returned. We live at an apartment complex, some buildings have been without power while other remained powered. Our building within the complex is across the street from the Washington fire station, and we believe this is why we have had power through most of the event."
"77098 just got power, out since 7 pm Monday"
"An interesting (if hard right slanted) [article](https://atomicinsights.com/south-texas-project-unit-1-tripped-at-0537-on-feb-15-2021/#:~:text=On%20Monday%2C%20Feb.%2015%2C,the%20feedwater%20pump%20to%20trip.) about the STP Unit 1 outage that cost us 1.2GW of electricity.

Don't really agree with the guy's conclusions, you don't run a reactor without feedwater pumps and a safety margin.  As bad as things are, a nuclear accident isn't going to make them better.

The last thing the industry needs is another disaster, as well.  Would've been great if there could've been more foresight in design (winterize pressure lines).  

But it's good to know there's no safety issue, and that the problem should be relatively easy to fix."

Anyone’s toilet start making rumbling noises? We haven’t had water in two days and have been using pool water to flush the toilet.

For what reason do we have to boil our water if there is no water?
How did I survive the snow and freezing temps without power loss and then everything turn to shit days later. Water has been out for over a day now. Xfinity cut out before midnight last night. Cell signal is going through pound town trying to get any information.
77008 timbergrove/shady finally have power! RIP to my clownfish but I'm so happy to be warm.
So here’s what I don’t get. Why don’t they just cut off everyone’s power during the day and turn it back on at night when it gets colder. Most houses are insulated enough that they’ll retain the heat produced overnight so that it will last throughout the day anyways right?
"Been without running water for 3 days now but have power. I just filled a few large pots with pool water, boiled the chlorine out for 30 mins, then let it cool a bit and used it to take a ""shower"". Just sharing my method for anyone else who is desperate"

"I live next to Firestation 51 and I have **NEVER** heard the sirens go off as often as I have in the past few days. 

Maybe it’s because there is no power so it’s much more quiet but I have also heard that emergency calls have gone through the roof. 

Oh and they don’t always turn on the sirens immediately, they turn on lights first and sound the sirens later. So there’s a possibility that even the ones I can hear is not an accurate representation of how much they are working right now. 

Side note here’s a video I recorded on Monday morning: https://1drv.ms/v/s!AqJ6xy-JVTIGqjzX1aVzBUMJCazB"

-1st “Black-out” was around 11:45pm last night and lasted until about 3am.
-Lights went off again, turned off around 10am. Also, little to zero water pressure. 

Some advice, fill your tubs as much as possible. Nothing worse then a cold apartment with a stinky RR. Seriously."
"Still no power or water but I found a car port to USB adapter so both phones are getting charged at least. I’ll take what victories I can get, my diabetic grandma got power back so I’m fine to suffer in cold as long as those with health concerns aren’t. If only it was actually being done that way."
77429 - Villages of Cypress Lakes.  After 36 hours power just came back on a few minutes ago at 11:20AM. We've decided to unplug everything in the house except the refrigerator and heater to help conserve power in hopes doing our part will help some of you get power back sooner.. Hang in there!

I'm not sure if I prefer that or knowing that it'll be out for hours at a time, because at this point I'm not sure what I'll have time to do when I have power. Do I have enough time to heat up soup? Make a pot of coffee? Charge stuff? Who knows.

Cell service has also been the worst it's been all week."

We’ve been incredibly lucky not to lose power at all thorough this whole thing. We obviously have no water right now. Do I need to worry about shutting off water to my house or is the only concern for houses that have had freezing temperatures inside causing pipes to burst?
Fuck COVID

Forecast this weekend slowly getting colder... was 70 for Sunday a few days ago now down to 55. I’m so over this
Be sure to check your tire pressure. The cold will fuck with it and cause your tires to flatten a little bit.

"77449. I live in a 5th wheel camper (long story). Haven’t had power/water since Sunday night save for a 2 hour period yesterday afternoon. We were able to get the place warm. ATT service has been terribly spotty but seems to be improving.

The good: I have finished two books and my cat has discovered cuddling is nice (sometimes).
The bad: I had to throw out two beautiful steaks and only have fish sticks in the freezer. I also have no wine. 

On a serious note: hope everyone is, at the very least, safe. ❤️"
"My wife is freaking out because she brushed her teeth a few hours before the boil water notice. 

She is scared she is going to get some insane bacteria.  How likely is this and what can I do to calm her down.

Edit: we do have power now btw for anyone asking."

Vote out all the republican clowns that allowed this to happen. Just know that this isn't [new stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Interconnection#Outages).

>February 2011, gas shortages and low temperatures led to 30 GW of capacity being unavailable and load shedding. There were prior severe cold weather events in 1983, 1989, 2003, 2006, 2008, and 2010.

Deregulation also screwed [California in 2000 by Enron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron#California's_deregulation_and_subsequent_energy_crisis). The same thing is happening in Texas where the for profit power companies wanted to charge customers premium rates so some power plants were intentionally offline. 

>After passage of the deregulation law, California had a total of 38 Stage 3 rolling blackouts declared, until federal regulators intervened during June 2001.[58] These blackouts occurred as a result of a poorly designed market system that was manipulated by traders and marketers, as well as from poor state management and regulatory oversight. Subsequently, Enron traders were revealed as intentionally encouraging the removal of power from the market during California's energy crisis by encouraging suppliers to shut down plants to perform unnecessary maintenance, as documented in recordings made at the time.[59][60] These acts contributed to the need for rolling blackouts, which adversely affected many businesses dependent upon a reliable supply of electricity, and inconvenienced a large number of retail customers. This scattered supply increased the price, and Enron traders were thus able to sell power at premium prices, sometimes up to a factor of 20x its normal peak value."

I went to take a look at my meter thinking I had a leak and discovered that my meter wasn't registering any water being used. Scratched my head about it, but figured since I didn't have a leak I'd just deal with living with a single sink for now and call a plumber when things calmed down. Decided to do some of the housework that often falls at the bottom of my list and took the faucet filter thingy off to give it a deep clean and immediately realized the source of my water problems. Went and cleaned all the other faucet aerators and now my water pressure is normal in every room."

"Has anyone else gotten electricity back but still no heat? We seemed to be browned out here. Most lights and the internet (thankfully) work, but the electric stove doesn't get hot enough to boil water, some lights are dimmed or not working at all, and the heat won't turn on. Not sure if this is a systematic brownout or something in the building's circuit blew specifically."

So at this time is it safe to reopen the water valve to my house? Would it he bad to still have my house closed off when the pressure comes back?
"77546, finally have power again nearly 72 hours later. Thankfully we have been staying at a friend's home who has a generator. We turned the water line off at the house before we left two days ago just in case. When we return to our home today and turn the water on, we know to go slowly and to check for leaks. Question is, should we go ahead and do so or should we wait until Saturday when things properly heat up again? I feel like we are flying blind at the moment.."
Hey is there any electronic stores open that I can buy a phone? Everything seems to be closed online. Thanks!
77030. No water. Not even a trickle. I wish I could have found some at the grocery stores but they're out of everrrrrrrrything.

"I've got to say the actual 'rolling' blackouts are much more tolerable than the ""only power for Downtown and the literal Galleria mall, the plebs can freeze"" plan that Centerpoint was running on initially.  

Just goes to show, the shitshow could've been dramatically ameliorated with a tiny amount of forethought.

Which is why it's so important to remember this and jettison our current state officials in 2022.  Because it would not have taken billions to fix this problem - just a *little bit* of forethought and planning.

A good example of this was the Harvey recovery money the County got.  Ed Emmett and the Republicans decide to give the money to the wealthiest property owners - the more value you lost, the more you got (much like the wealthiest electric consumers got their service protected, initially).  When Lina took over, she change the formula to value the income of the property owner more - so that if your entire life savings was in a house, and you made 40k a year, you got more than you did if your summer home loss was 100% insured."

"I have a question for anyone that knows anything about plumbing. We turned the water in our house off 2 days ago when pressure started to get really low. We opened all the faucets to empty everything out and eventually we had no water coming through. 

Well this morning one of our bathroom sinks starts having a steady stream of water. It has been going for about an hour now only when on the cold position. Not sure what is causing it maybe someone might have an idea? Should I leave the water to the house closed or try to open it back up maybe?"

"Is there official guidance on the rolling blackouts, like a website that says ""the city is aiming power at these zip codes""?

Looking at comments make it look like a pattern where some zips get shut off and others get turned on.

Those exterior lights are pretty, but certainly not required for safety. Would it be reasonable to politely, very politely, contact [property management](https://madisonmarquette.com/properties/2929-weslayan/) and ask them to turn off these and any other excess power usage?

Just had the nerve wracking experience of trying to bring back water (cold water - hot water side has the busted pipe). Slowly you add pressure and run around the house looking for leaks. Chickened out when the busted pipe (that should have been isolated) started looking like it wanted to drip. Got a whole tub of piss smelling water. Then the kid was being ultra helpful and pulled the drain.

"Update from my post yesterday.

My sister apartment went out of power late Tuesday night, close to midnight. Woke up Wednesday morning...drove all around Westheimer looking for gas, because I had a 4th of tank. Found a gas station, got their too late. So my other sister was there too and she was worried about her house so I had to YOLO it back to Alvin...hoping that along the way I would find a gas station. Thankfully I did.

- Funny story...I used my debit card at the pump and I accidentally entered the wrong zip code and it declined me. So I went inside and used it there and it declined again. Luckily in December I got a credit card and it came in clutch for me...holy shit.

Sorry for the diversion. So full tank of gas, that was one less worry to stress about. My sister got him and things we fine with her house, no lights...but nothing to major. It's crazy because she's not on Reddit but she was worried about her house alot and after reading stories here, I can't imagine how bad it is for some people. So I had to get dressed and head to work, yes, I'm the HEB guy from last thread. I was glad to get there because that's where I can charge my phone. There was a person on here DMing me about them being able to pick me up and take me to work and I'm very thankful for the offer. It's threads like this and DMs like that were people show compassion and genuinely want to help people that reinforce that there are really good people in this world.

Anyways, so I'm back home...my sister has been without power since early Monday morning. Luckily it's not in the teens, degree wise...but it's still cold.

I hope everyone is of positive mind, it's hard because so many people are in trouble right now. I know I may sound like a shill...but HEB truly does care. Unfortunately we had to limit water, bread and some other items but we just want as many people as possible to have water. We may be out of items but many partners are coming in and helping in any way possible.

Also, I hope people don't forget this. Don't forget the people who made it where we weren't prepared for this. We may not get cold weather like this all the time but there's no excuse for us not to have atleast have something in place...maybe thats me being frustrated saying this...people have babies, elderly people...hell I can't even cook anything...shit been like this for 3 days for me...longer for others. This is not fine.

Sorry for the extremely long and exhausting post.

-Edit...**LIGHTS...PLEASE LET THEM STAY ON FOR A LITTLE BIT...PLEASE!!!!**...and send some to everyone else as well...we all need warmth right now 🙏🙏🙏"

I’m freaking out about electricity bill 💵💰.. are we all REALLY going to be paying those crazy prices?? They can’t expect us all of Texas to afford that!
"As a savy law student friend pointed out, unless it can be shown that someone willfully broke the law, you will not see any “heads roll” for this. 
Don’t let Abbott deflect the blame. It falls squarely on Texas lawmakers."
Hot wheels is giving a press conference
77401. Power is back on but my pipe burst above my electrical panel and had to shut off water completely. Cried in the grocery store bc theres no more drinkable water and half of the grocery list we compiled beforehand. My neighbors really pulled thru in helping us but I really want everything to get back to normalcy soon. And the moment we get the chance to vote and make some fcking changes i can’t wait. There’s just got to a better way for our city and local government to handle all this.

"So 77494 in Katy near Kingsland and 1463, no power since 9:30ish AM. Off and on power before that since 6pm last night(typically 2 hours on, 2-3 hours off) it's not drastic, nor ugh. I went to the store to check on water, most everybody is out of water around. I got some expensive Core water, and grabbed sparkling water. This was at HEB and Walgreens next to Katy Mills. Side note, Chic Fil A opened back up today there and the lines were the most ridiculous I've ever seen."

"77036, power went back on around 1am but water pressure is down to nothing. No flow at all from the bathroom sink or tub and only a trickle from the kitchen. If there are any broken pipes in the complex, management hasn't told us shit. I've got my stockpot out to gather rain water so we can flush the toilet. Can't use pool water because the pool is locked. 

HEB on Bissonnet (the one by Rice Ave) is open but a disaster. They didn't have the upper parking deck open and people were just parking wherever there was any free space. No milk, eggs, water, meat, paper goods. Employee said they were hoping to get a truck in the morning but no guarantees. 

There are a few open fast food places on Bellaire between Bissonnet and 59 - McDonald's and Popeye's were the ones I recall - but the lines are well out into the street."

"Just curious, why hasn’t President Biden said anything about what is going on here in Texas? I know FEMA is sending supplies (water, blankets, etc), but why hasn’t he held a press conference? You know, just to say, we’re keep an eye on the situation, we’re aware of what’s happening? I know his press secretary addressed questions from the media, but I find it strange that he hasn’t even mentioned what is going on. I searched his Twitter and ... nothing. I don’t understand.

"I currently have a month to month variable rate with Infuse Energy. Average for 1000 kwh is 13.0¢ per kwh. With the market spike in prices, am I fucked? My EFL states “The price may vary from the disclosed amount solely to reflect actual changes in CenterPoint Energy charges, changes to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) or Texas Regional Entity administrative fees charged to loads or changes resulting from federal, state or local laws that impose new or modified fees or costs on Infuse Energy that are beyond Infuse Energy's control.” But nothing about market rate.

"Now that we are approaching the beginning of the end of this catastrophe, I cant help but think about what this means for COVID.  As terrible as suffering through this event was for many of us, imagine going through this with COVID.  A lot of people just had their prognosis seriously downgraded in the last week.

And beyond that, this was like Christmas and Thanksgiving combined exponentially.  People *had* to come into close contact with each other this time to get warmth where they could, we may see a similar spike in infections over the next few weeks.

My intent is not to doom post,, but simply to say that everyone should be extra careful for the next few weeks.

Ed:  someone mentioned below that its possible we will see the opposite as so many people were stuck at home.  It makes sense, and  I seriously hope that is true."

"I'd like a moment to say how much I appreciate and love my wife.

For the past month, she's been gone taking care of family and family friends who have died of Corona.

Because of that, I've reverted to my bachelor ways in all things, mostly food. 

We won't mention my debauchery, will we? 

While I've stayed faithful to the healthy food regimen I've been strong-armed into, the cravings for certain foods was too much.

Since she left my eating has been.. to certain extremes, luxurious and horrible.  

Its only gone down hill from there as the storm impacted us..or me personally.  

Boredom is my enemy. 

It has always has been.

In this case I've been eating every bad thing I can stuff in my mouth since I'm bored. 

Did I mention I miss Mrs. Pervert?"

My cat had to have emergency major abdominal surgery on Monday, and I need to bring her home soon, but I don't want to bring her to a strange house when she's already stressed and recovering, but also don't want to take her to my cold house. I mean, I'll bring her to my friend's place if I have to. I'm just worried. This is awful."
"Just curious, does anyone know what Beaumont is like? Power outages? Gas? Hotel availability? They are not part of ERCOT."

"Finally have power but Xfinity is still out. Is it worth calling or is it just out for everybody?

"So I've been thinking about what form the regulatory response to the crisis should be and this is what I think:

The state should offer subsidies for several manufacturing facilities to be built in the state in each of three categories:  silicon solar PV fabrication (this helps our semiconductor industry, too, which is getting a big boost because of AMD and Samsung), battery manufacturing, and electrical inverter manufacturing.  The kind of subsidies I'm thinking of are large tax abatements, and then a credit per unit production (e.g., the Feds offered a 3 cent per KW subsidy for new nuclear plants, this plan could offer a similar subsidy per GW of solar panel/battery/Inverter-Amp production).  

The state should announce income-scaled subsidies for domestic solar and storage installation (so people making less than median income should get >50%, ideally 100% subsidies for installing such a system - the subsidies for storage v. generation would have to be separate and scale differently).  They should require utilities pay the prevailing retail rate at the meter for installed domestic power.  Offer additional credits if the company locates its headquarters here, as well.  

Estimated total cost:  $50-100B over 10-20 years.  This represents a maximum 10% increase in state tax burden (which is about 30% of your total tax burden, so 3% in additional taxes - much less (and potentially zero) if you tax the energy produced and recover it over time).  Different, less generous subsidies should be offered to landlords tied to the number of tenants they serve.  

This has several advantages:

1.  Helps local business.  You have to install the power here, the vast majority of the cost of solar installation is in labor and electrical equipment (batteries and inverters).  Local workers, local small business owners get this money.  
2.  Distributed generation makes the grid *very* resistant to outages.  Because there are now millions of points of failure instead of just a few, it is much harder to 'kill' the grid with a few bad occurrences.  
3.  Texas is ideally situated for solar.  Insolation in Texas is [among the highest levels](https://www.mrsolar.com/content/solar-insolation-maps/maps/solar-insolartion-map-usa.jpg) in the country.  
4.  Solar is solid-state (so no moving parts to break, fail, or freeze; a moderate amount of ice on panels actually increases efficiency so less worry about that).  
5.  Solar is zero fuel (so completely resistant to fuel price changes).  
6.  Solar has very low upkeep (panels are routinely sold with 20+ year warranties, and the only reason they aren't sold with longer warranties is because the technology hasn't been around long enough to prove the life of service).  
3.  As oil and gas production falls off globally, there is going to be more demand for it in industrial (non-energy) uses; moving to solar frees Texas up to become the one-stop global supplier for industrial O&G needs.  
7.  Distributed storage massively increases grid stability.  Day-to-day grid operations are much easier, because there is a huge well of storage ERCOT could tap into to levelize any loss.  Depending on how much storage is implemented, this could even extend to powering the entire grid for an extended period just off storage.  
8.  Making generation customer owned would be a massive economic boon to middle class homeowners, who instead of paying for electric would now potentially be getting a check from the grid operator.  
9.  Texas retains its title as 'energy capital of the world.'
10.  The Texas grid could actually remain independent of the rest of the country, because the storage capacity would act as 'backup generators' on top of the generation capacity.  Now, we shouldn't actually remain independent - we should connect with the rest of the country and be the good neighbors we should be.  But it's an option.  
10.  Republicans can recruit a new class of donors from the nascent solar business owners (and we all know this is the most important step).  
11.  The reality is that the O&G-based carbon-intensive generation is *going to be phased out* over the next 30 years.  Period.  Sorry O&G industry, hard truths.  This plan creates a solution to this coming carbon phaseout problem that also has the virtue of insulating us against future grid failures like that created today - and ensuring that unlike West Virginia, our state's job losses are offset by transferring them to a parallel field instead of stubbornly insisting that time go backwards.

Please support the ""Guns are good and so are Republicans, yay Christmas and freedom lobruls bad Trump forever"" energy plan."

"my hot water was working fine throughout this experience, typically with the same amount of pressure as the cold water. Today, however, the hot water completely disappeared. When I try to draw hot water nothing comes out of the faucet even though cold water comes out at a meager trickle. I have a gas hot water heater and Best I can tell it is functioning fine, however the line labeled hot is cold to the touch and the line labeled cold is warm making me think there is a blockage in the outbound line. I don't know what to do, or if maybe once the water pressure increases to its normal amount the blockage might clear itself, but it would be really nice to take a shower for the first time this week. Any advice is appreciated!"

"I have water coming out of my hose spigot at the front of the house, but the faucets inside are bone dry. Fortunately I can use this for the toilets, but is this normal (I imagine due to low pressure) or could this mean I have a problem if I have water at the spigot (where my shutoff is, which is open) but nothing inside the house? I am hoping this just means the pressure is way too low to get inside of the house?"

Food and all that I was stocked up so have like a years worth. Maybe more. I'm going to check some neighbors tomorrow and see if anyone needs some dried beans, rice, flour or Vienna sausages or something. I have an 80 year old across the street plus a few neighbors with small children. 

I decided that of all things I really needed I lacked a carbon monoxide detector most of all  so I just ordered 2 from Amazon.  Other than that it was just staying in bed for most of it under lots of blankets playing Phase 10, Uno, Dos and Chess with my 10 year old son.

"For cigarette smokers and dippers, good idea to start keeping a box of cigars around in case you run out and stores/roads are closed. 

They can last years if properly stored. And they have much more nicotine than cigarettes. It gets absorbed even if you don't inhale.

Edit: Dont get the downvotes. Cigars might be too bourgeois for this sub."
"This is what happens when stupid fucking voters don't even know TRRC exists, much less what they do, including the incomptent commissioners we elect. It doesn't matter if it's Dem, Rep, this is what you get when you let corporations decide who regulates themselves. This is the fault of a stupid electorate, you had your chance in 2016, every newspaper in the state told you who the only candidate even qualified for the job was, but he came in third because he didn't have a D or R next to his name.

I swear, anyone in Texas who doesn't understand the power of the Lieutenant Governor or the role of the RRC shouldn't even be allowed to vote. I understand our education system is a joke, but its not like the electorate would care anyways until they have to actually earn their rights, and I consider that knowledge a pretty low bar."

My question is how long your power should be restored
"all you idiots looking for someone to blame.   this was a once in a lifetime event.   a good way to kill off renewable energy is to force it to be prepared for single digit weather in texas.  guess what geniuses,   if we have another weather event that is as rare as this one.  if from heat or cold we will have issues again.  i once lost power for 2 weeks up north during an ice storm.   same set of know nothings complained.  if the north east has 95+ temps in the summer they have blackouts.   take your politics somewhere else."

Anyone in 77042 have power?
Power went on and off at 8:30 77079
Anyone got info for 77036?
"Power back in 77021, lost it around 4/5am so 16ish hours total. Still pretty thankful, could have been much worse. Hopefully us losing power meant that areas with 40+ hr outages got theirs back."
77070 willowbrook. Lost power for 1 hr. Now it's back.

"77407, apartment complex, had power loss for 24 hours then around 9 came on for a few minutes, then stayed off. All the houses and street lights near me stayed on, even the apartment complex across the street still has power. This possibly an issue with the apartments themselves since everyone around us still has power?"
"I live directly in front of the elementary school(Barbara bush), and next to the catholic school in 77077 manderly dr. Anyone know how the power situation is going on there? I’m staying with family for the moment."
77013 just got power!!
"Just got power in 77003! We went dark 8am Monday, got power back for first time this morning at 2am, and lost it by 9am. Thankful we’ll be warm tonight."

"77070 water is back, thank god. I wonder if it's safe to shower though?"
77088 lights just went out 5mins ago
"So I have gone 24 hours with power. Power went out for like 2 hours or so at 10pm or so. I still have low water pressure but I was able to finally do dishes. Not sure if I can shower. In fact I'm not sure if my pipes are busted the water pressure is just really low, do you guys have low pressure?"
anybody know of any gas stations with gas in the area of 77429 near cypress point? and is the costco opened today?
Any westchase updates?

Is there gas in Katy?  I have a little over half a tank but don’t want to waste it.  Thank you!
Katy 77494 gas - I filled up gas on cinco ranch Blvd/grand pkwy intersection. No lines at 12pm!
Any insight on water in 77077? We’re getting an outdoor pipe fixed this afternoon and would love to be able to get a shower in before the freeze tonight.
What restaurants are open?
Water pressure back and we have power in 77028. But of course the water still isn't drinkable.

"It's been said elsewhere over and over again, but holy crap are the public comments on all the major news outlet websites disappointing.  If you never explored beyond those comment sections, you'd think Houston was just overrun with the biggest illiterate, unscientific, non-critical-thinking population imaginable.  I've read over and over and over again from every news-affiliated meteorologist stating that we wouldn't know enough about Laura's track until Wednesday, so do what's best for your family and heed the warnings of local officials.  Err on the side of caution since ""we just don't know yet.""  But every moron seems to be popping out of the woodwork declaring ""I knew this would be a non event,"" and loads of fun </s> blatantly racist remarks about BLM and ""Dora"" ruining everyone's week.   Maybe it's unsurprising that the most vocal among us are also the dumbest among us, but man is it depressing seeing the trash spewing out of people's virtual mouths in situations like this."

Was watching Piotrowski last night and they seemed relatively safe inside a multi-level concrete parking garage. I might keep my eyes open and try to find something similar in my area, in the event that I don't feel comfortable staying home, and evacuation is impossible.

Any ideas? Where would you go if you had no choice but to ride out the storm?"

Who else's job has refused to close down or adjust hours due to the Hurricane? I am a non-essential (research) worker at Baylor College of Medicine and despite the fact that Baylor admitted the situation may be unsafe (and the rest of the Med Center closed for non-emergency) Baylor wants us all to take Vacation time if we feel unsafe to come to work.

Dumb question. It seems that my area won't be hit but will face power outages. Should I turn off appliances beforehand? I normally keep a fan on my dog during summer nights.
Okay the woodlands (Montgomery county) is back under a tropical storm warning.
"Out here in Cypress it looks like we don't have much if anything to worry about, at least if DarkSky is anything to go off of. I'm seeing a pretty consistent 13mph wind all night."

"Does anyone know how to volunteer/help in the aftermath? I've got a truck and could haul a trailer back and forth, want to help out if I can."
"Humble here. It's getting pretty gusty. My cat is unconcerned for the most part, but has her ears pricked. Also, due to my job I have to be located in Houston as it is tied to a very specific location. I love my job, love love love it. Its perfect for me. But if this wasn't the case, I'd move to Dallas or El Paso in a heart beat after this close call.

Update: heard my first ""wooo"" sounds of wind. Dumbass cat is sleeping on her tree by the window"
Are the active times for hurricanes through September? I get that hurricane season goes through November but I haven’t heard of any bad hurricanes for Texas in October and November.
Is there a timeframe for it to move east? It doesn't look like it has moved east much but the models obviously are better at predicting that vs looking at it on radar
Looks like Jeff's stream got sabotaged.
"Hey everyone, I remember some people posting about how they are preparing to lose water. Why would we lose water? I don’t remember ever losing water during a storm."
Anyone have any hurricane hunter air craft footage of the inside of the storm?
"It's mildly breezy here on the west side, near Voss & San Felipe. It was predicted that between 9 pm and 3 am is when the tropical storm winds would be blowing over the city... so I guess we're in the clear."
I’m literally less than a few hours drive from the expected landfall point of one of the most powerful hurricanes recorded at landfall and it’s just a bit windy here. I don’t understand.
"Hi all, I’m originally from Houston. Had to move to Fort Worth for work. I rode out Rita and Ike and Harvey etc. and have to say I’m much more scared living away form my family than I was riding those out with them. Just looking for some specific information. I have a grandmother in Baytown who is refusing to leave her home. Can anyone tell me what it’s looking like for Baytown specifically? Everything I’m seeing is talking about the more in the path cities like Beaumont. Thank you ❤️"

So are we in the clear for sure now or is there still a chance it turns back towards us?
"Of course, the hurricane with the same name as me is the one that is apparently rivalling Katrina. Yaaaaaaaay"
"Coming from South Florida, it is baffling how blase everyone in this city is about hurricanes. We don't panic in Florida either but we take storms very seriously. Yes, Harvey flooding was awful but its a completely different threat from true hurricane force winds. Not that winds are worse, they're just completely different. But everyone around me was 'we didn't flood during Harvey we are fine'. I think I was the only one in my neighborhood who actually got plywood despite there being 50 million trees everywhere. Do people really think their buildings built under the shitty Texas code will hold up to a hit from a Cat 3 eyewall? Come on..."
So it's no longer going to hit Houston it seems like?

Why are all of these comments immature?
Planning to head to bed early and catch some middle of the night action. What time do you guys think would be best to set an alarm if I wanted to see some wind here and watch the weather channel people in lake Charles? I know landfall is around midnight but I’m guessing it won’t reach any place where the weather channel is hunkered down until several hours later.
Is it out of the question that it turns towards Houston?
"Dumb question but when will this ""clear"" the houston area. Thursday afternoon?"
"I live on the west side of downtown Houston, and was planning on flying out tomorrow morning at noon. I have up until an hour before the flight to cancel and have been trying to gauge the best course of action, because I'll be leaving my cat home alone for a few days until someone an come check on him. 

It's sounding like I shouldn't have anything to worry about at this point? I can reschedule the flight but it's gonna cost an extra like $240. It also sounds like we should know by tomorrow morning if this thing is really going to affect us any more at that point, yeah?"

I think someone needs to stop Eric and Matt. At this point I think it's kind of a point-of-pride street cred thing that the hurricanes all aim at Houston because they know that this is where Eric and Matt live. It would be better for them to just shut down their website.

"As a Houstonian I've learned, you either leave way earlier or you're not leaving at all."
"Went to east TX. Normally takes about 6 hours. I spent 21 hours driving a manual transmission vehicle, never getting past 1st. It was difficult to find fuel and there were vehicles being abandoned on the sides of the road. This is probably why they won't call for a mass evacuation again."
26 hours to Dallas. I was a kid so I don’t know the route we took but still it was something I’ll never forget. Left in the middle of the night
"We lived just off 45 near UH. We loaded up the day before landfall and tried to get to Austin with our cat. Over the next 7-8 hours we inched from 45 and Cullen to Beltway and 290. Finally called it quits and u turned to get back home. Went to grocery store which suprisingly wasn’t empty, stocked up on supplies and stayed up the next night to watch the storm completely miss us."
"My sister was living in Waco back then and I thought about heading up to her place, but I had the news on and saw how horrific the traffic was and decided to stay put. I don't blame folks for hitting the road, what had just happened in New Orleans with Katrina was scary as fuck."
I stayed home and watched the Lost season 2 premiere.
We left at 2am the day before and it still took us 13 hours to get to my Uncle’s house in Dallas.
"Fucking horrible, there was 7 of us in a minivan and we didn’t turn the AC on because we wanted to conserve gas. It took us almost a day to get to Hutto. Never again, I’ll just take my chances and stay at my house from now on."
"My gf and I spent 7 hellish hours driving from Clear Lake to Cypress. Our two cats, who hated the car, spent the entire time screaming and puking and shitting in their carriers. We ended up just going back after realizing it probably would have taken us 20+ hours to get to Austin. You could feel the collective white knuckle tension from the tens of thousands of people around you also stuck in traffic. In 45 years never felt anything else like it. There was also a worry that if we didn’t make it further quickly enough we could get caught on the road in the storm. 

They hadn’t opened contraflow lanes so it took us less than 30 minutes to get home. Spent the next day drinking beers and riding our bikes around the ghost town of our neighborhood."
I lost one of my best friends due to his stress levels when stuck in the Freeway. His heart gave out. Had a 1 year old too. Tragic.
"This shit was why I always laugh at disaster movies where they're telling people to evacuate, cus I know what it would really look like. I never want to experience that again. 

The entire freeway was full including people using the shoulder, there was nowhere to go. No gas available anywhere. People just getting out and walking their dogs, talking and shit, because traffic wasn't moving at all."
"My family and I evacuated to San Antonio from Dickinson Tx in a kind of caravan fashion. It was the most brutal, apocalyptic 36hrs I’ve ever been through and the reason I won’t evacuate anymore unless I’m forced. And that’s 36 hrs hours spent on the road to go to San Antonio, a normally 4 hour trip. I peed in diapers because as an 8 year old I just couldn’t handle going on the side of the road. My aunt lost both of her dogs to stress. My uncle totaled his car bc he fell asleep behind the wheel, thank god he was okay. It was just really unorganized and frightening. My mom bought me shark boy and lava girl after because I was such a “trooper” through the whole thing."
"I’m convinced that part of the reason why no one evacuated during Harvey was because of how bad traffic was during the evacuation for Rita. 

also part of the reason why no one from the City of Houston or OEM sent out a mandatory evacuation for Harvey."
"My flip flop molded to the shape of my clutch. 13 hours to get from Lake Jackson to Cy Fair. I was in high school and my parents were out of town, my grandparents were watching me for the weekend. They wanted to ride it out but didn’t cause I was with them."
"13 hours from Richmond to San Antonio. Got there and went to Pat O’s. Drank Hurricanes and margaRita’s. Threw up in a urinal. Good times, 2/10 don’t recommend."
"Fucking terrible. My dog over heated in my car and threw up on me. Took me 6 hours to get out of Houston . Took me 12 hours to get to San Marcos.  Should’ve just stayed home. On the plus side I ended up meeting my ex wife who became my kids mom, so that was a plus sort of"
"I was a vet tech at the time. The amount of people's pets that died from heatstroke during the evacuation was really sad.

People were low on gas and with no gas available too scared to run their car's AC and some breeds just don't handle the heat well.

Also, my mom made the mistake of eating Taco Bell and got diarrhea and had to shit on the side of 59 with nothing by my dad holding up a towel to try to give her some privacy from the other drivers."
"I didn't evacuate, but I was working at a home depot on I-45 that day. Traffic was at such a standstill that people would leave their cars on the freeway and walk into the store to use the restroom and buy water. One woman was lying face down on the cold concrete floor. When I went to check on her, she said she was fine, but her car had no AC and the concrete floor was cooling her off. Her family was still in the car on 45 while she was in the store. 

When I drove home around 5 that evening, the backroads were completely empty. I'd never seen it that empty, complete ghost town. Such a contrast to the mass of cars sitting on the highway all morning and afternoon."
"My wife got a bladder infection because she wouldn't pee ducked down behind the car. 

It made me realize how few bridges there are across the Brazos River.  (Coming from Austin)"
Drove 12+ hours heading north on 59. Ended up on Palestine and stayed at an evacuation center there since my mom’s car overheated.
6 hour drive using nothing but back roads to San Marcos. 0/10 wouldnt recommed
"I tried to get out of town but after 8 hours and only 1960 to show for it, I said fuck it, I'mma go home. Turned around at Townsend and made it back the way I came in less than 20 minutes. I was resigned to letting the storm rage around me and let the chips fall where they may. Ended up getting a slight breeze and no rain. I watched TV until I got tired and went to bed."
I got to 45 with my dog and turned around.  Facing Rita was preferable to that bullshit.
"I evacuated my 83 year old grandmother who was in not great health. I had already spent time in Mississippi working the relief effort after Katrina and saw the fallout. I knew my grandmother could not survive that. My father and I rented a minivan and filled the back with gas cans and brought non-perishable food and water. I drove all night from Louisiana to pick her up. I took a 30 minute nap on her bed and said “let’s go.” 
It was pure hell. It took us over 28 hours to get back to North Louisiana. I only saw ONE cop car the entire way. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cars out of gas on the side of the road. No contra flows.  Every person for themselves. We got out to pee on the side of the road. People were wanting to hijack our gas cans. Thank God Dad brought the gun. It was pure lawlessness. The news did not report all of that, obviously. I was pissed they were saying how much law enforcement were helping out. Nope!"
This gave me instant ptsd. I was 17. It was hell on earth. It was hot as hell. It took 23 hrs to get from Houston to Austin. I got hit by an 18 wheeler out of anger. Ran out of gas at hour 18. Bathrooms and roadways were insane. I’ve never evacuated again after that. I’ve also relocated to Los Angeles.
"My parents got onto 45, took the next exit turned around and went home."
"Omg so not worth it. We went to my grandmother’s in San Antonio and the 3 hour drive took about 15. My brother had just badly broken his leg during football the week before and had to sit in the trunk of our Ford Escape the entire ride to stretch out his leg. Every bump we hit he screamed in pain.

Came home to barely a chair tipped over"
"26 hours to Brownwood. It was an absolute journey into madness. Broken down cars, people stealing gas from running vehicles. Urine bottles lining the road. My uncle lost his two Pomeranians because of the sweltering conditions. We pulled into a Walmart parking lot and I let my wife sleep. I was supposed to do the same but everything was so sketchy I stayed awake."
"I was about 13 years old riding in my mom’s minivan with our dog in the back and our cat in a cat kennel. I have a vivid memory of the cat kennel accidentally getting open in a gas station and I had to panic chase my cat under cars trying to not lose her. 

And while stuck in standstill bumper to bumper traffic, our minivan gave out and we had to call my Dad and brother, who were hours ahead of us after having taken backroads and thus had to backtrack to come save us. I ended up falling asleep in a fast food parking lot waiting for help to arrive and when I woke up, my uncles and cousins had arrived and I was in a Harley Davidson pickup truck driving through the grass medians all the way to San Antonio. 

Spent the remainder of the evacuationvacation playing Gauntlet Dark Legacy with other family friends that joined up with us."
"Absolutely surreal. We were some of the first to go through 45 in Conroe when they made it all one way and almost got in a head on collision. Took 12 hours to get to Dallas. People peeing on the side of the road, broken down, garbage everywhere. Slightly worse than today I suppose…"
I saw an old woman shit in the evac lane on i10
"Car overheated in traffic downtown Houston. Was a AAA member, they refused to tow or cover the tow I paid for (later claimed they never did that... still wouldn't cover expense when called on that - not a fan or customer of AAA since). Was also insured by them, had just renewed. Found out later they 'revised' my application for coverage to be liability only so if the car flooded it wasn't covered, then raised the liability cost to take all the money. Niiice. Nursed the car back to the south side of town, switch to another cramped two seater/no back seat car (that didn't overheat!). Got back downtown around 1am, traffic had cleared out until around the 610 loop on the North side on 45. It still took \~20 hours to a relatives house just South of Dallas (aching from the car with no room to stretch). I was awake around 48 hours. Luckily I had enough gas in my car to get 2/3 to Dallas, past the point where there was no gas. A friend went towards Beaumont then North, and as everyone in Houston was going North or West he had a much better experience.   


If a similar storm were heading here, I'd leave again even knowing it'd be a similar Fubar situation. Rita had a record breaking storm surge, something that'd have put more homes underwater than Harvey did (though different areas), with added wave destruction. We got lucky. Rita's low pressure bubble popped just before landfall (I'm very thankful for that), so Rita came ashore as a 'normal' hurricane and also missed Houston. I don't have a crystal ball, so I'd leave as it'd be hell to stay if it hit without more than normal weakening.  
As tangled as everything was, the only real fault was that plans for evacuation hadn't been updated to account for the huge increase in population. Until the Fubar happened there wasn't the political will to fix things so the folks who knew, couldn't. It took time to get it done, but the road situation (South bound lanes used for North) and getting Gas trucks and gas delivery to help stranded folks all did get done before the storm hit. That was really an epic and quick turn around from the mess at the beginning. I'm really sad for the elderly folks in the evac bus that burned. That's the tragedy I remember."
"My mom worked at Conroe Regional and wasn’t allowed to leave. They were bringing in people from heat stroke and CO2 poisoning from I45. 

I remember how TRASHED everything was afterward. Like wtf why do people just throw trash out their car window in a crisis? It was so trashed up in Willis."
"Unless you can leave Houston four days, maybe three days, in advance you're screwed."
"I happened to leave before the evacuation order and was annoyed it took 8 hours to get to Dallas. By the time I made it there and saw the news, it was already up around 14 hours...

I heard from a few friends that ended up stuck on the highway when the storm hit and just rode it out in their cars on the side of 45, one of them ended up doing CPR on an older guy that had a heart attack on the side of the road and EMS couldn't get to them. 

Our house lost a few tree branches and one broken window."
"I live in Sugar Land and was working outside Minneapolis at the time.  My wife was at home by herself, unsure whether or not to evacuate.  My supervisor had approved everyone from the Houston office leave to get home early, so I caught a flight about 10 am.  It’s a three hour flight from MSP to IAH, so arrival was around 1 pm.  The flight was nearly empty, with most of the passengers going through to other destinations.  As the flight was passing over 45, the pilot told everyone to look out the windows, either side, to see the traffic headed north.  IIRC, the southbound side hadn’t been opened yet as contraflow, but the northbound side was bumper to bumper as far as you could see.  There was a woman on board that, the closer we got to Houston, cried and sobbed louder and louder, such that a flight attendant sat next to her for comfort.

That’s the happy part of the story.  Once we landed, getting a taxi to Sugar Land was impossible for one passenger.  After about 2 hours waiting for a cab, eight of us banded together to take a taxi van to different destinations and share the fees.  The first stop was near 290 and BW8, next was a little farther south on BW8, then Highway 6 near Copperfield, then 6 and 10.  When we got to 6 south at 10, it was just in time to have the intersection shut down so people going north on 6 could make a left onto the westbound feeder for 10 to make turns without stopping, to get onto the freeway entry ramp.  We had to wait about 20 minutes, at the light, before the sheriff would allow us to make a right turn.  We u-turned at Barker Cypress and made a right onto 6 south again.  There was one stop on 6 around Westheimer, then the rest of us agreed to ride to the Fountains in Stafford and pay for the remainder of the fare.  At each stop, the driver picked up whatever was on the meter at that stop from each customer.  If more than one got off, they split the fare.  On the way to The Fountains, we passed within a couple of hundred yards of my house; rather than pay the full fare, I just rode on and split it with the other riders.  

Unfortunately for all of us, everything in the shopping center was closed.  When my wife showed up, there was one older lady left, so we sat and waited for her ride to show up.  It wound up taking over 5 hours to get from IAH to my house in Sugar Land, and we were going against the traffic flow most of the way.  My wife still talked about evacuating, but after seeing all of the traffic, I told her we were staying put.  Neighbors that lived around us had stories about driving west on 90A  and it taking 4 to 5 hours just to get to Richmond, which is normally less than 30 minutes."
"I live in a flood zone that was told to evacuate. Left southeast side of Houston at 3AM, got to the Northwest side of Houston 14 hours later.

The people in Katy that decided to evacuate and plug our evacuation routes can eat a bag of shit."
"It was an absolute shitshow. I didn't want to leave but my husband did. I lived in Clear Lake City when Alicia hit in 1983 and figured if I could make it through that one, I'd be fine, but we packed up and hit the Katy Freeway which was at a standstill. We finally managed to got off the freeway in Columbus and take back roads to Austin where we stayed until it was ""safe"" to go home. Never again will I leave."
Drove for 7hours but my elderly grandma couldn’t take it anymore - turned around and got home in 10 minutes
"My mother-in-law worked in Missouri City but lived in Willis (northern Montgomery County) and she went to work when we asked not to. I called to check on my in-laws, father-in-law answered, said that M-n-L just got home. She'd been stuck on I-45 for 22hrs in traffic getting home. 60 miles of absolute gridlock.

After Rita the state started creating hurricane evacuation routes, allowing both left and right shoulders to be used for evacuation and creating contra-flow lanes. That's also when we started seeing lots of hiway and interstate improvement projects."
"I was 21 during Katrina and Rita. Luckily, I was more interested in hurricane parties than evacuating. Did take us four hours to get food and booze, though."
This was also was about a month after Katrina. That contributed to the panic for Rita and people that wouldn’t normally evacuate wound up leaving that year.
"It took me 36 hours to get from Galveston to Tyler. We had to abandon one car in Trinity due to lack of gas. I created a pee device using a Swiss army knife and a plastic sport water bottle. I am a woman, btw. I was pleased with my innovation."
"Was driving limos back then. Spent the last two days ferrying rich people to private airports to leave.

We decided to ride it out until we realized that afternoon we had no food and everything was closed. 

Rolled a couple of joints with my brother and roommate and hit i10 in our cars that evening heading to our friends apartment in Austin.

I10 was a ghost town littered with cars. We never drove under 90mph. At one point we were getting passed by  state trooper doing almost 100mph. He waved and kept going. The most surreal part of that whole ordeal for us.

Spent the weekend partying and went back when things started opening up.

God I miss my college days."
"I stayed, and it was phenomenal. The entire metro area turned into a ghost town.  I drove through Pasadena and ran like 5-6 lights just for the hell of it, and we all know how present Pasadena police typically are, lol. I also drove to Sugarland from the east side in a little over 20 min. I was just hauling ass on the freeway, and there were very few vehicles on the road. I never lost power and had plenty of food at home, it was awesome. 

It was pretty baffling to me how the entire area vastly overreacted to Rita. I guess everyone was paranoid because Katrina had just happened. However, they all failed to realize that New Orleans geography is distinct and that it was bound to happen there unless they addressed their infrastructure.
There are most certainly areas of the Houston area that needed to be evacuated, but the way it was handled by local meteorologists was ridiculous and the entire thing turned into a clusterfuck for anyone who tried to leave."
"One of my classmates died from Heat stroke in his car trying escape, left a wife a baby behind in the car with him.

My family stayed put and were fine."
It sucked.  My youngest kid was like 3 months old.  It took us 8 hours to get to our friend’s place in Austin.
"I was only 7, but I remember the stress on my parents faces while we were lining up at a gas station near Dallas."
"I didn’t even leave, but it took me somewhere around 3 hours to make it to Tomball from 290/Hollister. Backroads the whole way, 249 was a parking lot. 

Told my boss I was working from home after that. 

Every gas station / ATM / grocery store around me was empty, managed to get lucky and catch a late night delivery at Walmart and get some food. 

Absolute shit show. Lost power for most of a day, bit of fence fell down, and a really crappy nights sleep. 

Pretty crazy watching all the transformers popping in the neighborhoods nearby from my 2nd story window."
Rita taught us not to ever evacuate the city en masse again.
"Just stayed and watched on news the cluster fuck then took a nap and woke up and saw the cluster even worse then turned of TV and watched DVD and drank and partied with neighbors and a few friends.

Been through too many hurricanes since the early 60's to panic and freak out. Did stock up on fuel for generator and batteries and ammo and water at beginning of season as always anyway as always be prepared."
"It took me 24 hours to get from Galveston to Spring. In the truck with two screaming cats. I packed bottled water, a few sodas and some granola bars. I kept headphones on to drown out the cats. Cut the top off of a water bottle to pee in, then I dumped it out the window. Luckily I didn’t need to poop. Not sure what I would have done for that. 

Mom left Clear Lake a few hours before I did, but really was only a few miles ahead of me. She stopped a few times for gas, snacks & bathroom break. I stopped once for gas and waited in line for over an hour. Didn’t even bother to go in the store. 

I saw the sun set at south 610 and sunrise at north 610. I never ever will evacuate again for a hurricane. Stayed home for Ike & Harvey. Sold my house and moved to the north after Harvey."
Local news was to blame. The repeated messaging was “if you can get out then might as well get out.” They changed their tune later.
My parents were walking around on 45 handing out apples and water bottles to people.. quite a few people died just sitting in traffic.
I didn't evacuate but boarded up the windows. It was so hard to find plywood so I wasted so much time and energy. After that I decided I will never board up the windows even if the hurricane is coming straight for me. That's why we have insurance.
"We left the house around three.

We had barely hit Conroe at midnight.

Also my grandma from Mexico was visiting for the first time in years so at least she got to experience the whole thing with us lol."
Does anyone else try to spot their car in these Rita traffic pictures?
"Lord, it was a shitshow. My inlaws lived near Galveston Bay in the mandatory evacuation zone. They packed up their RV, picked up my grandpa in law, and headed to a private campground somewhere outside of Huntsville. We lived in Southwest Houston then but I was recovering from surgery and my doctor said that I needed to evacuate too because of the potential loss of infrastructure. My husband and I were going to leave the next day because he couldn't get off work, and meet them at the campground. The inlaws took the freeways and main roads and were stuck in the evacuation gridlock for like a day and a half. I had my road atlases and Key map and we took the back roads, even cutting through forestry service roads in the Sam Houston forest at one point. We got there in about 5 and a half hours. They had only been at the campground for about an hour when we got there, and they had left a day earlier."
"Got shot at(kinda).

We lived in Katy, and Grandfather lived in La Grange, so we went northwest. Took 2 vehicles, Dad driving my truck ahead while I drove with Mom and the pets behind. Stuck to the back roads, north of 10, and made decent progress for a couple hours to about halfway point then stopped. Two lane road backed up going into a little town for miles.

One thing that sticks out from there, our progress measured in yards per hour, was all the water from the air conditioning, combined with the sun, started to melt a strip from the asphalt. Every car wound up with asphalt stuck to their tires there. 

Eventually a group of people started to go contraflow, hopping into the other lane to just make progress. My dad pulled the truck out, my mom and I following behind. Suddenly Ahead of us a guy gets out of his truck, lifts a rifle and starts firing rounds above the incoming traffic, pissed we were bypassing the line. Mom screams, because she saw in the truck ahead of us my Dad lifting his shotgun and point it at the man thru the wind shield.

They had a stare down as he drove past, then quickly we followed behind and headed down the road.

All in all it took around 8 or 9 hours to make it to La Grange."
"Getting into the MadMax evac was waaaay more dangerous than the storm. 

A lot of people died on the road. No one was killed by the storm."
"I live about 30 ft from Galveston bay 

Rita evacuated to grandma’s via back roads. Wasn’t too bad drove behind trailer full of lions part the way 

Ike evacuated to Sugarland,  stayed in friend’s pool house. Was like a party 

Ike stayed at home"
"Well, we had a caravan going to my dad's mother's. 

Car behind us needed water and he had a shit ton, my dad told me to get in the back of the truck and get some bottles for the people around us. 

So I hop out the Truck, jump on the tailgate bumper and bend over for my pants to fall around my knees and I'm not wearing any underwear. 

I45 saw my pastie white ass."
"I was in high school and lived in Spring Branch at the time, left at 5am and took 15 hours to get to San Antonio (like 7 of those were just getting to Katy)- IIRC it took until early-mid afternoon for TXDOT to figure out the contraflow logistics for the freeways. People had their cars in park on I-10, I got out and walked my dog near the beltway. Also, zero phone reception, since everyone was trying to use their phones. My family was in two cars, I would get out and walk to our other car to relay messages. It was wild.

It’s easy to say we shouldn’t have evacuated in retrospect, but here’s the thing a lot of people who weren’t here at the time forget about that hurricane: Rita was like three weeks after Katrina and was a bigger storm, that looked for a time like it was going to directly hit houston. Everyone was on edge with good reason."
This was the largest peace time evacuation in the history of mankind.
"So my story is very different. My brother lived in Shore Acres a coastal neighborhood on Galveston bay. He asked me to come help him get his belongings out of his house. So I did. When we left his house, the nightmare of traffic congestion, and there were roads being blocked by police. We rolled up to a police road block, ""I grew up here and know all of Houston like the back of my hand"" I told the officers that we were headed to my sisters to help get her and her kids ""she has no kids lol"" out. They let us go on through. That little white lie saved us hours if not days of being stuck on the freeway system. We went u to my mothers house in Spring. We had east west access to grocery stores and restaurants, but north south was completely grid locked. It was sweltering hot, cars on 45 were a dead stop. People had exited their vehicles parked in parking lots and were seeking shade under the awnings of businesses. We made sandwiches and cold drinks and went up and handed the out to the people we could get to.. We were limited to only a mile or so north of us, as all north south traffic was at a dead stop and south of us was Spring creek with only the freeway to cross over it. We used back roads and side streets to access as many people as we could.. And then,,,, NOTHING HAPPENED!!! Of course this was all the fault of Rita and the media and the general ignorance of the public. I heard a call on a radio station with people asking what to do if they got flooded out,,,,,,, IN CONROE!! If you dont know the area, Conroe is about 100 miles from Galveston and WAY ABOVE sea level.. I thought what an idiot.. But thats what caused that nightmare. People not having any real understanding of why NO flooded and having no clue of how a hurricane acts when it makes shore. People  IN COASTAL AREAS were told to evacuate. The problem was that people no where near coastal areas evacuated too, for no reason at all. It was a blatant ignorance panic fueled human stampede."
"I worked at a grocery store at the time and it was HORRIBLE. Everyone was such an asshole about the purchase limits for water, etc. After one shift, I ended up telling my boss we evacuated even though we hadn’t because $5.25/hr was not worth it. 

After Rita is when they added the evacuation lanes to the highway and I believe they open up the southbound lanes for northbound traffic."
"It was hell, eight hours and we made it three miles"
Windy
"We lived on the very north side of Houston, I think my dad saw it coming and we left before most everyone, because I remember it only being like 4-7hours to Austin (usually a 2 hour drive) instead of the 20 hours other people had. That and he knew all the back roads so we didn’t even drive on a major highway"
Just stuck on the highway for hours
"Houston and the suburbs were a ghost town. I remember going to Lowes theaters in Stafford and there was no one checking tickets no concessions but all the movies were playing. I saw Wedding Crashers and Lord of War then I drove down 59 S going 140 mph because there wasnt a soul on the road. Of the friends that stayed we partiesld our ass off, one of my fondest memories in high school."
"Had no cell phone reception - the cell networks went bonkers. So had to call family in India who then called my cousins in California who called my cousins in sugar land to see if they had space to pick me up. Left Sugarland with my cousins - I didn’t have a car. We left around midnight and progressed about 200-300 meters in the next 12 hours. Realized we were sitting ducks if the hurricane ever came our way. By then the news reported it was weakening than originally expected, so we turned around and went to a friend’s place and boarded their place up. 

The storm came and took a 90 degree turn towards Lake Charles and we all escaped. But the whole evacuation process by the city was a CLUSTER FUCK. 

That said, the city was prepped by the time Ike came in 2008 - no chaos and smooth evacuations for those who wanted to."
"I had to sequester at work, our building was on Hwy 6 and there’s some angled signs in front.  All day long we watched people pee behind them.  My husband and daughter went to Nacogdoches and left before the traffic got bad.  Everyone else just said screw it and stayed at home."
My mom was getting remarried on lake Livingston and they drove back roads to there from east Houston and it took them about 9 hours. I was fortunately watching it on tv and at her advice I just stayed put in tanglewilde. So I missed my moms second wedding but she said that was ok because I wasn’t there for the first one either lol
"28+ hours to the Dallas area from Galveston. Saw many people dead on the road with sheets over them, broken down cars for days, 3 hour waits for gas and watching fist fights in those parking lots, and terrible gas stations just gouging so much. 

I also remember once I got into the Dallas area how gracious and kind everyone was(weird to say). Everyone thought this was gonna be our big one, and I had more than a few gas stations up north slip a few extra supplies in my bag as I left."
"Left at about 4am; took 18 hours to get from Clear Lake to the Woodlands. Our original destination was Dallas, but it wasn’t feasible. We ended up staying with a friend of a friend in a house with 23 people and 5 dogs."
"It was hell. 9 hours just to get to Austin. Family stayed at a friend's house. Got back a few days later, and the house was totally fine. Wish we all stayed. Harvey was an absolute shit show compared to Rita."
"Be nimble. FEMA types need to make some kind of call ( almost always the wrong call) min 12-24 hrs before landfall. 

They’re using terrible (still best available) info to make their calls. 

Button up your house, fill up the car and spare gas cans if you can safely take them with you and watch the storm like a hawk.

Plan evacuating in @ least 3 different directions. During Rita I did well driving to the coast and the SW along the shore instead of north on I45…. Where everyone was directed to go.

Be sensible, responsible  and use your own head. Don’t be a lemming."
"I was just a kid but I remember being shoved in the back seat of my dad's old pos red chevy pickup. It was so hot and there were blankets all around me. We never moved fast enough to create a breeze inside the cabin and the AC didn't work. Eventually we'd been stuck in the same spot on the interstate for so long that everyone shut off their engines and got out to stretch and get some air. It was such a bizzare experience to see everyone out of the cars on a 3 lane road like that. I remember someone had a camping stove and just started cooking some food for their family while we waited. Eventually we made it to San Antonio after what must have been like 24 hours. Stayed with some people I'd never met, and have still no idea who they were. Watched Cat in the Hat a bunch of times until it was time to go back. The power was out for a couple weeks and we kept the boards up on the windows that whole time. We ate MREs that my grandpa had picked up from FEMA. Our chicken coop had a big branch fall right on it so we had to repair that."
"Got to Austin in about 3.5 hours.  Since everyone was driving North, I drove South to US 90, took that West to 36 North, and took back roads from there to Austin.  Easy sauce."
"Had tickets for ACL festival that weekend in Austin. Decided we likely weren’t going on Thursday but Friday things looked a bit better. We siphoned gas from one car to the smaller more fuel efficient car and set out at 9 pm taking Westheimer as far west as we can to FM362 and then cut north. Took us about two hours to get to 290. When we crossed I10 it was just a solid line of headlights. We hit 290 probably 1am and it was also just jam packed. So we headed back to Houston and got home around 3am. The next morning however i10 cleared and we set out around 11am and made it to Austin by around 3. We enjoyed Saturday and Sunday at ACL festival although it was like 109 degrees. I remember the Arcade Fire on the Funeral tour playing Five Years by Bowie and they were wearing vests and sweaters and I was legit worried for their safety. 

My wife was 8 months pregnant. By Sunday she joined us in Austin because there was no gas little power and no shopping open in Houston. We stayed for about three days extra and headed home."
Anarchy. Law Enforcement was MIA. Preparation and planning was nonexistent.
"14 hours from the Heights to Irving.   By the time we got to FM 1960 we said fuck it, got off the highway and did backroads the majority of the way - using a paper map.  Got to my uncles house and spent a few days lounging by the pool, drinking margaritas and, as it turned out, making a baby.

A few days after we got home we were still trying to locate a great aunt who was evacuated from Beaumont to Alto.  I went and fetched her, drove to Beaumont so she could get some things and as we were going thru Woodville and Lumberton - I have never seen anything like it - hundreds of giant loblolly pines (3-4’ diameter) all snapped off about 10’ up and all pointed toward the coast like the back side of the hurricane got em.  Can you imagine to noise all that made?"
"Evacuation vacation! It was miserable driving for some 20 hours to get from Rosenberg to Love. I was a recent high school graduate, and I was very disheartened with how terribly people acted; when the whole community needed to come together to help everyone, far too many people acted completely selfishly. It was a real wake-up call to me about the nature of people."
"My family and I evacuated. I was pretty young so I don't remember a lot of the details. But we must have left at about 4:00 am three days before it was supposed to hit houston. We were planning on going to Muskogee because that was the closest hotel that had a room available to us. Traffic was at an almost standstill on 45N. We slept in the car when we could. Gas was pretty hard to come by. If you could find a station that had any left, there was a line of 10 cars in front of you waiting to get gas as well. Tempers flared and I saw multiple fights gas, we even had some full gas cans in the back of the SUV chained up, and they got stolen.


After three days we had made it as far as Plano. We got lucky and were able to get a hotel room for one night there. All 12 of us, plus 14 dogs were in this cramped hotel room watching the TV when we saw the news it had changed course and was no longer hitting Katy (where we lived). 


Tempers were hot, days were long, resources were scarce. At the time I felt like I was living a nightmare. Now we look back on it and laugh at all the crazy things we saw (or did). With all that being said, I haven't evacuated for a hurricane since."
"We thought about leaving because my grandma was pretty frail and we weren't sure she could ride out a week without A/C. But we're in a higher area of town, didn't flood during Allison and survived Alicia fine. After hearing about the people stuck on the routes outbound, we were staying put no matter what.

Neighbors ran out of gas on 290 and called us, hoping we could do a rescue. We called some dude my dad worked with who lived in Waller hoping he could get to them. That guy called a cousin who was closer still. Epic game of telephone to get them help. 🤣"
"Lots of traffic.

I admit I got off super easy. I only left because my mother would not chill out even though I was certain I would be fine, since I lived in spring. So I went to their house in LaGrange.

It took me 4 hours, instead of the usual hour and a half to two. But here's what I did:
I bought a road atlas and had printed directions (back in the day before GPS). I knew the freeway was going to be a mess. 
I left at 4:00 a.m. on the Thursday.  Drove out 2920 until I hit 290, then I took 290 to Brenham (not bad about 20 mph but consistently moving). I got off the freeway in Brenham and took country roads the rest of the way into LaGrange. I almost hit cows and drove across a one lane wooden bridge. The slowest part of the trip was crossing highway 6 on 2920, that took at least an hour because people were blocking half of 2920. I was lucky enough to be in the left lane so I was able to get through easily.

My now husband went to his mom's house in The Woodlands from Webster, but he went there two days before the evacuation got crazy.

My now in-laws tried to evacuate their house in Manvel, and after 2 hours not going anywhere, they turned around and went home.


I can say that it was wild in LaGrange too. People went to hand out gas to cars along I10. One of my mom's friends owned an RV park and she had to start asking very specific questions when people called to reserve spaces since one person asked if they accepted animals, and then brought cows."
A day that you realized the layout of this city is a death trap if shit really did hit the fan.
"21 hours for my father and I to reach Waco. 

Along our travels, we witnessed….


1. A BBQ place give us a free onion+pickle+bun sandwich because all other food items had run out. Not even togo boxes, napkins, straws, sodas/bottled water were left. Just veggies and buns lol

2. We got gas 1 time and we were super lucky to get it. Some saint from the heavens stood at the members only gas pump and Sam’s or Kroger (I don’t remember the name of the gas station) and was swiping a member card to either get everyone discounts or to allow us to get gas from the member only pumps.

3. At the same gas station^ there was a man who tried to fill up 10 red containers of gas but was held up at gunpoint after he filled up his 6th or 7th one and robbed of 4 red containers of gas by 2 men in broad daylight in front of hundreds of people in line. Not one person got out to assist lol. We are all waiting for gas and he’s filling up his truck and 10 containers. Selfish. 

4. Some cars over heated or broke down and so the owners pushed the cars under a overpass or on the grass in the median and set up a tent using the roof and doors and blankets to ride out the storm (which never came thankfully).

5. An Ambulance ran out of fuel and the patient died. Our relative was the patient. 

6. What “contra flow” meant and how it can be created on (out of?) roads that were not meant for it. 


Overall, it was a life changing experience. Largest mass migration of humans at once in the USA (at the time) all for a storm that never hit. To this day, I know people who have refused to leave for anything because of the Rita evacuation."
"From Cypress, it took us 3 hours to reach Brenham. Parents, 3 kids under 10, 2 dogs, and a cat. Took around 10 hours total to reach Austin- we ran out of gas once in the gridlock and I nearly fainted from the heat, but there was a wonderful samaritan nearby who had the foresight to bring several tanks. I know I was lucky- many people died that day. I remember seeing people peeing and pooping on the sides of the roads, and an ambulance unable to pass."
"Insanity, I was 15 at the time and my parents saw a cat 5 headed for us after what they just saw happened to NOLA and freaked out. Drove with my mom and little brother 100mph the wrong way in the 45 contraflow north of Conroe and every time traffic backed up on one side would drive across the median to the other. My dad worked near 610 and Airline at the time and it took him over 9 hours to drive to our home in Spring that evening."
"Took us 10 hours to get to cleavland. After that, we were done with trying freeways, so we got off and cut through backroads. It took us 24 hrs to get to Dallas. Thankfully some of the small towns off the freeway still had gas"
My mom and I drove to Plano with our dogs. Took both cars. We got up early and it was still hectic and chaotic.
About 24hrs to get to Austin. Left around 7 or 8 and got to Austin 7am the next day.
"My family left the West Houston area (think Barker Cypress and I-10 / Cullen Park / Addicks Dam) the early morning before Rita was supposed to make landfall. 

The pressure in the air was eerie. Everything was telling me to leave. My animal pals wanted to leave. There air outside was incredibly silent and still. No bugs nor frogs nor birds sang. Just stillness. 

My parents did not want to evacuate, but I bargained with them. I personally brought in all of the patio furniture. I taped up the large windows. *And I mapped out backroads for us to evacuate to San Antonio.* Our one and only stop was in Shiner to let our 2 dogs relieve themselves. We got to rural San Antonio just in time for breakfast. 

Somehow, the only damage my house sustained was my washing machine broke. I still don’t understand how that happened. 

My boyfriend’s (now husband’s) mom evacuated from a flood prone area in Pasadena. She got stuck on a freeway. Her car died on the latter part of the first day."
I drove from Montrose to Spring (steubner airline/louetta) and it took me about 5 hours
"We left much earlier than most people, and it still took us almost 8 hours to get to the Huntsville area, taking back roads to bypass 45 as much as we could. 

And I was stuck with my mildly insane mother-in-law and no antidepressants.

Rita, that bitch, wound up doing more damage up that way than she did back at our house south of Houston. Once we figured this was happening, we said, ""Fuck all THIS"", left, and went home. 

It was a fucking nightmare that I never want to experience again."
I live in the city of So Houston and the law was driving around with a speaker bellering MANDATORY EVACUATION. We started towards the Valley and it took us 2 hours to get to Rosenberg. It was hot and muggy and cars on the highway were overheating because they sat for so long without moving. Many travelers were in vehicles with no air conditioning and they were suffering. I saw a flatbed trailer with a goat in a cage along with chickens and dogs in cages sitting in that stifling heat. I decided that we could not continue and went back to South Houston. I didn’t care WHO said it was a mandatory evacuation. I was not leaving and we all know the outcome of the storm.
We left Friendswood at like 10 that morning.   We reached a hotel in Dallas that would accept our dog at like 2AM.  We left at 8 am to finish our trip to Kansas.   Listening to the radio it took 4 more hours to get to Dallas for every hour later people left.
As close to SHTF day as I can imagine. The heat didn’t help either. Katrina scared the shit out of all of us.
"I remember walking down I45 passing out water with my sister, was surreal. Any time I hear the Faint I am reminded."
Drove for 20 hours and decided to turn around and drove 25 minutes
"We were in a mandatory evacuation zone. 

I was 9 months pregnant and thought I would have my daughter on the side of the road. 

We took back roads from Conroe to Huntsville, but had to get on I-45 for a couple miles and that took several hours. 

We ended up going to Arkansas, out of necessity, because all of the hotels in Texas were full with Katrina evacuees. 

Overall, we were lucky.  But it was a super scary time."
"I did that. 14 hours to get to San Antonio, which is usually 3.

Ppl had run outta gas and were stranded in the side of the road. I saw old ppl just laying down on the grass by the interstate as we drove past at 5 mph.

I saw a sign that said ""need water for baby formula,"" ppl that looked like they were passed out on the grass. More people seemed stopped than moving. 

I had a 1 yr old in a car seat. We couldn't run the AC because there was no gas. The news told us babies overheat easier so we were fanning her the whole time. 

I pulled into a gas station 1 mile from my mom's house at exactly 0.0 miles left in my tank."
I live in Conroe. The freeway was a sea of parked cars.  My boyfriend and I went to hand out water along the road.
"Oof.  Twelve hour drive to Austin with two dogs, one who kept getting car sick.  Stressing over finding a gallon or two of gas at a time to keep going.  Such a long day."
I convinced my family to head south to Corpus Christi. It barely took any extra time and we stayed there for a week. Came back and the only damage was the roof had been torn off our barn (assuming a tornado came through at some point as the house was fine). My best friend’s family ended up stuck on 288 for 24 hours and barely got anywhere. They ended up just going home.
"My mom and brother live in Galveston County. I moved to Oregon, but I heard all about it. My brother and his grown kids kinda drove as a caravan, with my mom included. They were on the road for over 6 hours and never made it past 610 south. My brother said people were falling asleep at the wheel. Occasionally, someone might bump the person in front of them accidently. He saw someone pull out a gun, more than once. Lots of people got out of their cars to pee or poop on the side of the road. He said it was awful.  My mom said she will never leave again, even if it's a cat 5."
"My dad was coming back from a work trip in Atlanta. He said on his way INTO town from IAH, he was one of maybe ten people on the road into town and everyone else was on the way out. He said it looked like a scene from an apocalypse movie."
I am so thankful my parents turned the car around 30 min in. What a huge waste of time and gas for so many people
"I lucked out sorta.  l knew someone who had gotten stuck trying to leave New Orleans a year before so understood probably better than most what a nightmare the roads could become. I convinced my husband at the time to leave work in Sugarland early so he got home before everyone got on the road. 

Myself was a teacher and had to go from Little York Road to my house at the time off of FM 1488 and 2978. Packed up the classroom hamsters and was gone by 3:15, my coworkers thought I was crazy. 45 N was empty until I hit south of The Woodlands and traffic just stopped so I got off at Woodlands Parkway to cut over to 2978…basically any road headed E-W was fine and any road headed northbound was stopped. 

Took me an hour to go the 2 miles on 2978 to get to my house, literally thought about stopping and walking the rest but since traffic was still creeping forward I eventually made it. Few hours later the stories of cars being abandoned, gas stations being over ran and people stranded on the road started pouring in….realized I missed being one of those folks by an hour or so."
"12 hours from Clear Lake to Cleveland Tx.  I got out and walked some while traffic was not moving.  We started with a full tank of gas and ended up with half a tank.  

When we stopped in Cleveland, there was a sense of lawlessness.   

We then boarded FEMA buses to take us to Austin.  We started out with a police escort but they bailed as soon as we got outside the city limits.  

That bus ride was something out of a dystopian movie."
"I was 15 years old. The adults were freaking out. All the moms were packing food in coolers and calling pharmacies and all of the dads on the block had maps spread out across the hoods of their trucks trying to get us all out of the city in one convoy.  I remember taking a walk the afternoon before we evacuated. I couldn’t take the noise of the adults anymore so I went out and just started walking. It was so quiet. I can still remember the trees rustling. I was nervous because I didn’t see a single animal in sight. Not a bird, not a stray dog. Not even a squirrel. Empty streets of nothing. Everyone was already gone, we were some of the last to leave. A family who stayed behind died when they accidentally put the generator in the house. I don’t think they knew any better. They just didn’t have the means to leave. It was a surreal time to be alive."
Had family off 1960 (house prone to flooding) and in the woodlands(not prone to flooding) at that time. As the youngin with a car I got to transport people and stuff a lot. Each round trip would take almost 8 hrs up kuykendahl and back.
Must have left at the worst possible time. I remember it took close to 24 hours to get from Friendswood to North Houston. Horrible traffic was around when the bus of nursing home patients caught fire and killed a bunch of people on I 45
"I didn't have to evacuate. I was working in the woodlands at a vet clinic / dog kennel on the freeway. There were so many people stranded on the freeway in front of our clinic. I can't remember the numbers but I remember being horrified by how.many people dropped their pets off, paid the deposit and never returned to pick them back up.
 
My normal 20 minute drive home from work took nearly 5 hours on the back roads and I almost ran out of gas because you couldn't find any."
"I was a young kid and we evacuated to a family members ranch. Was horrible and we got stuck for hours. my sibs and I ended up watching the simpsons over and over on one of those dvd players they used to put in cars. 

My grandpa died in the evacuation but he was not traveling with us. We have never evacuated since then"
we were leaving from the memorial / alief area and it took us about 6 hours to get to Katy. the most impactful memories I have are 1. a guy busted out a grill on the side of the road and was throwing down some burgers and hotdogs and 2. every single gas station was completely sold out of gas
Don't eat milk and grapes before evacuating.
It was trash. Took me 14 hours to get to Austin. My uncle from Galveston got stuck on the road for hours and that caused some kind of clotting in his leg from sitting so long and he died from the complications. I’ll never evacuate again. I’ll go on my roof and sit in the rain before I drive during all that mess.
"An old lady died on a shuttle in traffic behind us, they stopped at a small town and an ambulance took her away. Churches were giving out food and water to anyone who stopped. The road was so hot my shoes stuck to the asphalt. It was an honestly terrible time"
"Went from Sugar Land to Waco. We left like at 4 in the morning and got stuck on 99 when it was just a feeder road and a couple lanes. We were stuck in the same quarter mile for like 6 hours. I don’t remember how long it took us to get there or when we started moving but it was all so pointless in the end. 

I was like 13 at the time."
Looks like a normal day in LA :/
Took 8-9 hours to get to Austin from Spring. We got lucky that Rita made that last-minute turn. Rita was a firebreather with 160+ knot sustained wind.
I stayed home.
"We ended up on some back roads with my dad getting steadily angrier. A woman tried pulling in front of us and my pops wasn't having it and she almost ran us off the road. My dad pulled a cased shotgun across his lap and looked and nodded at the woman. She drove into the dirt and sped ahead. We moved about ten more feet and were then swarmed by police. An officer popped open my door and told me if I moved he'd drop me like a bad habit, (I was 15)."
I was just a kid but my dad took back roads with a map he printed out on Mapquest somehow and we made it to Kingwood in about 4 hours. They made the decision to ride out the storm back in Galveston County after the storm shifted. We drove back home with the freeways being completely empty. It was one of the eeriest things I've ever seen.
Wild to think more people died trying to leave than the hurricane itself
Lesson - the danger posed by weather is inversely proportional to the warnings on tv.
"Never to take a route through Houston. When Ike came, we drove straight west until we reached the Hill Country. Also, backroads are your friend."
"My chihuahua dog and I went to a friends house in New Braunfels from the Clear Lake area leaving the afternoon before, normally a 3 hour trip, took me 12.  I was on my flip phone with my friend while he was looking at mapquest and guiding me to use back roads where possible, instead of using i-10. Those back roads were still at a standstill. After moving 11 inches in an hour I decided to drive in the opposite lane of the 2 lane road which had not a single car going in any direction, and did so for as long as I could and it shaved off days of driving. Got to my friends took a nap, went out and stayed well after people returned to avoid the rush back. I did have to pee in a bottle and I dropped it and urine got on my person."
"The road was so hot that the tar was seeping up from the asphalt. If you got out, your shoes got it all over."
"At the request of my wife’s family, we agreed to evacuate from NE Houston to go stay with family in Lufkin( normally 2.5 hour drive tops). 

My, wife, two dogs and I loaded in my MILs Toyota Camry and started our journey. 26 hours later after a fender bender, at least two panic attacks, a 1 hour nap and bologna sandwich at a church refuge in the middle of the night, we arrived in Lufkin. Not long after we arrived we found out that the hurricane had changed course and was headed directly towards us. Luckily we were far enough inland that we didn’t get hot too hard. But, we did lose power for a couple days. 

To top it off, when we got home, we saw that the microwave time was still set, indicating the power never even went out at home. 

NEVER AGAIN!!!"
It took ~16 hours to get from the Beaumont area to my family's home in San Antonio.. fun times
3 hours from Sugar Land to Cinco Ranch. 2 digs and 3 cats and 4 people. One cat decided she needed to ride on my shoulder using her claws to balance. Said cat the took a shit on one of the other cats. That's when we said f this turned around in the median and was home in 30 minutes.  It was not my idea to evacuate. The husband insisted. I'd been through Alicia in 82 and knew we were 60 miles inland. Never felt so good as being right.
I was in it for about an hour and gave up. I went back home.
"We evacuated from a small town just outside Beaumont, about 20 minutes from High Island. There were 4 vehicles in our ""wagon train"" loaded with everything we could take. I was in my 98 Honda Civic, no AC, windows down for ~19 hours. It had a manual transmission. By the time we arrived at our destination, my clutch leg was cramping and when I blew my nose it was completely full of black soot from all the vehicles exhaust. The roads were lined with cars that had broken down or run out of gas. People were begging for food and water. It was pretty apocalyptic."
"I still have ptsd from that day.  Was planning to head North but made it to IAH and just left my car there and took a flight out.  After seeing what had happened with Katrina, no way I was staying in Houston."
20 hrs to San Antonio non stop
"We went to Waco/Rosebud from Houston. I was in the 9th or 10th grade. A 4 hr drive horrifically transformed into a 12 hr gridlocked clusterf***. Came home afterwards, house was fine. Everyone was afraid from Hurricane Katrina."
"I was in college 2 hrs away in East Texas, so I watched it on TV."
"It was insane…my family headed out earlier, got caught in traffic a few miles out of town. Nobody was moving. Someone’s dog died from overheating bc people were running out of gas to keep their cars on.

My mom called me and just told me to stay put, I ended up hanging with a buddy from my neighborhood, got some beer, decided we wanted smoke, so drove up ONE exit to my buddies house on the feeder…and it took like 2-3 hours to get up there…it was terrible. Annnnnd then Rita didn’t hit…"
"It was a 5 hour trip on the Hardy from downtown to Lake Conroe. Peed in a gatorade bottle. Probably could have just gotten out of the car, gone on the side of the road and gotten back in without missing a beat."
19 hours and made it 75 miles before we turned around and came home when we learned the storm shifted
"Took me 13 hrs. to get to Sealy from BW8 & I10. It was crazy.  Just bought my first manual car 2 days before. My clutch leg was tired.  Had plenty of snacks and water. It was hot & humid. I remember seeing a toddler walking around in just a diaper. There were some people who brought out their webber grill and were cooking food for people around.  Decided I was going to run out of gas if I stayed on my course so, left I10 and took back roads to Montgomery.  Took me 45 min."
Just like that picture (for people that don't know about back roads)
"I was a kid in my mom’s beat-to-hell Saturn and I was hoping we would just ride it out. We spent all day in traffic crammed in. We got to the place we were going to evacuate to and got told to fuck off by the police because they said it would be bad there too (near jasper, tx. I didn’t live in Houston then)   We ended up being taken in by strangers somewhere north of there, can’t remember. But spent even longer in traffic.


But ended up being a great thing we did leave after police told us because a really big tree fell and destroyed the place we were going to stay. Would have killed my grandparents probably"
"I was living in Conroe and working in Willis. Company at the time sent me all around town to pickup every single cell phone battery I could. Ended up having to sneak along back roads just to get back to the office. 

Still remember driving home on the feeder road laughing."
Took us 22 hours to get from Clear Lake to Austin. 290 in Waller County was brutal.
Me too
"I drove from Spring Branch to my parents place outside Conroe. Normally 45 minutes but took me 8 hours.

I remember being behind an 18 wheeler and an SUV with some sticker in the back window. Because traffic was insane, I figured it wouldn't hurt to pick up new music. So because it was 2005, I pulled off 59 and into the Best Buy in Humble to buy some CDs. When I left there and finally got back on the freeway I was literally behind that same truck and SUV"
Took us about 15 hours to get to ft worth from the woodlands. Came home just for a 3” diameter tree to be tipped over. So then we stayed in town during Ike and lost power for about 10 days
"I lived in Spring, so there was no need to evacuate, but we needed to get something from Lowe’s, on the other side of 45 from us. We ended up having to make do with what we had because the backup at the freeways were so bad that, while you could get to the west side of 45 (since the highway was south bound on that side), there was no getting back across because of the backup to get to the north bound lanes."
"Took us close to 40 hours to reach Dallas. We got so lucky to get gas at a gas station, people were crazy for gas, people fought for gas. Was pretty scary. Next hurricane, forgot the name of it(not Harvey), said fuck that, never again."
"I was in high school. We left on the Wednesday evening after school. One of the last groups to get out. We were able to find gas without much of a line at Sam’s Club. Packed the parents, three kids and two cats into a sage-colored Toyota Sienna and drove toward San Angelo, TX.

Earlier that night, my dad showed me a map and told me to pick any city away from the coast. I picked this lovely small town I had never heard of for a safe, weekend retreat. 

We drove single-digit mph for a while, but after passing through San Antonio, the roads were much clearer. Our hotel was next to a beautiful stream/river bank, and it was a dry heat that felt lovely compared to the bayou. We walked around the antique stores and saw advertisements for the local sheep run the next day.

Watched the news in the hotel breakfast area that the hurricane had avoided Houston, so we made our way home pretty quickly after that."
It took us 14hrs to get to San Antonio.
Luckily I was working out of town and was in College Station so just stayed put there in a hotel. As an example of the madness the gas stations in College Stations were out of gas like the day before already.
"I was stuck in traffic driving to Lubbock for over 24 hours. It normally takes 8, and the only reason it didn't take even longer is because we used a road atlas in the back of the car to take some more obscure back roads. I'm beyond thankful we didn't run out of gas, but we rode without air conditioning for as long as we could to try to save every last drop. 

It was miserable. People died, and if Rita would have actually hit, *so many* would have drowned."
"Controlled chaos. People were wild, we saw one guy hitting a car with a cane, heard a couple of stories of individuals pulling out knives over spots at gas stations, saw gas station bathroom conditions I can never unsee. We evacuated from the Galveston County area and traveled up to Dallas with my family. We left at night and traveled up 45, we were still in Houston by morning. We managed to find gas at a station a distance from the freeway and we had to wait in line (station only had premium left). We also stopped to nap since we spent all night inching up the freeway. Once we got to the point where the south bound lanes were open for driving north we moved faster. I was to switch between north and south bounds sides when there were slow downs. My brother and I were traveling separate from my parents and we were separated for most of the day. It was damn near impossible to make a call with a cell phone but texts were still working, and this led to my parents finally learning to text the old school way. We got to Dallas that night, took us over 24 hours to get somewhere that normally took 5.

We had extended family that we met up with and their trip was similar. A couple of them turned back around way early, and the others got stuck on the opened HOV lane iirc but made it to Dallas the morning after we did. They almost had to abandon a vehicle but found gas, and their beloved 15+ year old dog passed away during the trip :( 

When we got home, there was little to no damage to our house."
"I forgot what hurricane I evacuated, but we waited the day the hurricane hit. i10 had hundreds of cars on the side of the road that presumably ran out of fuel. It felt like those zombie apocalypse movies where you’re just driving past all the stalled cars. That experience and driving the day after Harvey hit and also during covid are becoming too common"
I only evacuated from Kingwood to River Plantation. Got there in less than 30 minutes taking back roads; Sorters Rd. to FM 1314. No one was using it so I was FLYING about 100mph the whole way. Drove over 59 looking like this though.
"Let's see.  12 hours to get out to Conroe from med center, 10 of those hours just sitting on 45 in the Woodlands.  No AC, hot as hell, stressing about finding gas. My dog looking like she was gonna die from hear exhaustion."
It took me 12 hours to make a drive that would typically take me 90 minutes.  Pretty insane.
"We had a hurricane party at a friends house, when all our “party supplies” ran out we headed the opposite direction of traffic to get more and laughed at all the losers in traffic"
"Didn’t leave, helped my dad board up some windows (waste of time), swam in my neighbors pool because they evacuated, then went to a Rita’s for Rita party and got hammered."
"We evacuated at three in the morning because my dad thought there wouldn't be as many people on the road in the middle of the night, but NOPE. We were headed to my sister's place in Denton, and what's normally a 4.5 hours trip took about 12 hours. All in all it could have gone worse. We didn't run out of gas and had the dog with us and the dog was great despite being stuck in the car for so long. I remember we were flabbergasted that they still hadn't closed down the southbound lanes for contraflow. I honestly don't remember if they ever even did that at any point. It was a total shitshow.  

Meanwhile our neighbors waited until the day the storm was gonna hit before they left for San Antonio, and it was smooth sailing for them. 

My parents stayed behind for Ike after that experience and ironically the house actually took some damage in that one."
"It was a younger time… we loaded up 4 cars worth of friends with no plan, but we did all have Nextel radio phones… took us 19 hours to get from Orange to Austin. No gas, no food in the gas stations, many more hours spent in park than in drive. Did most of the drugs we had on the way, to arrive at a friends cousin house that grew her own weed. Sat wasted and stoned glued to the weather channel it showed us in real time our city getting whacked."
I was on this bridge with my dad watching the traffic.. grew up in Oak Ridge..we had the silver suv near the middle. It was kinda a party up there.. my buddy rolled up and made margaritas in the bed of his truck
21 hours to get to Austin. Normally a 3 hour drive. Had 5 seniors over 70 with us in our caravan.
Really bad
It was driving 11 hrs to get to Austin. With no gas.
It took me 12 hours to get where I needed instead of the regular thirty minutes.
"I was 16. I was late getting out of town because a friend needed a ride home from school. Her carpool left without her when school shut down early. My parents hadn’t finished their work day yet but told me to start driving to Austin to stay with my older brother. Soooo yeah, did that drive in that traffic alone as a 16 year old. It took 7 hours to get to Austin I think?"
"I was at work down in Mo City, came out the door, looked at Hwy 6 stacked up, said Nope, took the cross streets home and stayed put. It was weird having this huge city all to myself like some zombie apocalypse.

Right after Ike I was working off I10, the streets were largely deserted yet some old lady managed to drive her car into the side of our building. Houston's finest were out directing traffic at intersections without power but the sheriff's boys somehow didn't have anything to do. I counted 17 deputy vehicles in our parking lot attending to this old lady."
"I was stuck on 290 in a two door Cavalier with my sister, her boyfriend, my cat and 90% of my stuff for like 36 hours. We moved 2 miles in 2 hours. Eventually we walked to a WalMart, found an unopened gallon of water, drank it and pissed behind the dumpster.

[edit] I was living next to NASA at the time."
We planned on staying but some people came through the neighborhood on loudspeaker and said it was an evacuation zone. We piled in to my mom’s suburban and took some weird ass alternative route to south Texas with some family. It took an extra 3-4 hours to make the drive but it wasn’t terrible compared to a lot of people that just got stuck on the roads.
"Litty, I remember playing snake on my Nokia sitting in my cousin ss Monte Carlo for hours, traffic was so backed up we sat on the trunk sometimes and jumped out and switch cars. Made it to Huntsville and these nice ass people who ran a bed and breakfast let us stay the night for free. Eventually ended up in a gym with sleeping bags at some church…simpler times man"
"I was a kid and my family left relatively early, made it to Dallas in about 18 hours. 

Most distinctive thing I remember was 94.5 playing nothing but requests on the radio. Heard some weird songs like Three Little Pigs by Green Jelly, but the most played song was Wake Me Up When September Ends by Green Day and I remember crying to that a lot. That song is forever tied to Rita for me."
Took my mother 21 hours to go from Leauge City to the Woodlands where I lived.
I live close to the coast and really need to evacuate in these situation. I remember being parked for 18 hours getting more and more pissed at people on the north side bugging out and creating the mess and then getting worried about getting stuck on the freeway when the weather came. So terrified mixed with angry.
Busy
Important to remember that it was the largest urban evacuation in human history. Crazy stuff.
"Horrible, I was leaving from Lake Jackson gulf coast area during that time. Took us 22 hours to get to college Station for a drive that is usually 2 and half hours. Forever grateful for A&M University for opening its doors to hurricane evacuations that year. 

During the drive we did try to get breakfast from jack in the box and the poor employee was trying to close the doors as the inside was already about 40 people deep. She just started throwing cups at everyone saying to take a drink and leave that business was closed."
"It wasn’t fun. We were new to Texas and had just seen what NO went through with Katrina a few weeks before. It took my wife, two kids (2 & 5), two dogs and two cats 16 hours to get to the first hotel we could find with an available room somewhere up near Dallas. A guy offered me $100 for five gallons of gas we were traveling with and when I told him it was not for sale he tried to steal it.  We haven’t tried to evacuate for any other storms since."
"We went to Mexico which was about a 6 hr drive and it took about twice that. After that and seeing Rita didn’t do anything we never evacuated again. Luckily for us, my parents house is raised so it’s never flooded"
"I was a kid at the time so I was chilling in the back seat with a gameboy and a fresh pack of batteries. Took about 10 hours to get from southwest houston to cypress. Not sure how far we were planning on going, but my dad’s friend who lives there wait to just stay with them.

Oh and I remember my uncle being like an hour or two behind just had his Rottweiler in the back without shade or water. When she died he just left her on the freeway. Dude’s a little different."
"I was a kid. We drove for 27 hrs from pearland, made it to the woodlands and my dad turned around and got home in 30 min when we realized gas was low and we weren’t going to make it to Dallas. The storm was uneventful"
"We stayed in and will always remember the call of ""oh hey it turned east right before landing"", RIP Beaumont and the people on  i10."
"We were going to stay with family outside Brenham. Took us 8 hours to get halfway there.

Turned around and were home in \~45 minutes."
"It fucking sucked. After 3 hours I was only in North Houston and going delirious it was my reality. Me and the cat took a nap then made it to family in OK after 24 hours. This is why I didn’t evacuate in Harvey, that traffic experience was horrible."
"Bruh took us 36hours to get from Alief To Tyler Texas, I never ever ever ever want to go through that again"
18 hours idling to Austin. Was a nightmare and so many people got stranded and ran out of gas. My father fell asleep at the wheel and bumped the car in front of us. That didn’t help with morale. And we ran out of water and had to feed our cat LaCroix. That was funny.
My friend drove from clear lake to Livingston and it took 13 hours lol
"I stayed in my apartment off 290 in Jersey Village and waited it out. We went “truck surfing” on a very empty 1960 to get gas before it was all gone. 

I would look out at 290 from my apartment complex to see how far the traffic had moved, and it effectively didn’t for 15-20 hours maybe? It felt like a whole day and then some."
"I worked at a car audio shop in Huntsville, 1st exit open on 45 and thry had both sides foing north. Was a wild time, gave out a bunch of free water and phone chargers... and then someone drove a truck through the shop at like 2am and stole all the JL equipment."
We didn’t leave because we were pretty sure evac was going to be a disaster. Boarded up and rode it out. We lived over by Hobby Airport and the water stopped rising 5ft from the front door. It was the right call but we had our doubts … until we heard about the snarls on the highway. We were fortunate.
I was so glad I rode this storm out lol
"11 hours to get from Meyerland to the Woodlands.  Parents wanted my sister and I to stay with my dad at their house.  My mom was a paramedic, so she had to be stay at her station."
"Well we lived in sugar land and took the country roads to Dallas but it was still slow moving, took us 13 hours. I found myself pissing in bushes on the side of the two lane roads we’d be on so a lot of people took pictures of me haha. My brother in law had access to private gas stations used for oil tanker trucks. So we never ran out"
"It was crazy. We left a day before the storm hit, it took my family 14 or more hours to get to Waco from League City. There were cars abandoned on the side of the road because people ran out of gas, people were outside their cars talking and walking around."
"Oh god that was terrible. That was the day I learned ""evacuate early or not at all"". 

I spent 14 hours in the car in one stretch going what felt like .5 miles per hour. Eventually made it through and made it all the way to Tuscaloosa since I figured if I'm evacuating I may as well evacuate to a good football game.

I got to see Darren McFadden and Felix Jones play so it wasn't all bad."
Took 11 hours to make it as far as Columbus when my dad said fuck it and turned around and drove 45 minutes back home. Gas stations were out of fuel and we didn’t pack enough food to drive that long so I guess he figures he’d rather gamble staying over running out of gas and being hungry on the side of the highway for the next day or two
We don't talk about that day.
Mass evacuations just can’t work
Does anybody remember that Michael Douglas movie ‘Falling Down’?
"Eh, just stayed home"
"I left work at 2pm that day, I didn't make it home till after midnight.   Greenspoint to The Woodlands."
Very very very boring. It took us 8 hours to go what normally takes about an hour. It was awful.
I was sleeping in the car. Parents told me they took 2 hours to travel only a few miles before they gave up and went back home.
I was blessed with a father who has a 6th sense for storms. We evacuated two days before Rita to Mexico and avoided being without power for god knows how long. Same thing with Harvey. I was like 24 and my dad told me to call into work for the rest of the week on Wednesday. We took the cars to get an oil change and headed to Mexico that night. Storm hits on sat/sun? And my best friend was texting me that the water was up to their knees at their house and they ended up on their roof trying to get rescued. Luckily nothing happened to our house but Houston was a very ugly place for weeks after Harvey so we stayed put until Harris County made me come back to work lol
"I remember being on the road for about twenty hours just to get to Dallas from southeast Texas. Also when the radio station started playing Rock You Like a Hurricane, I fucking Lost it and laughed during the whole song."
"I got laid, it was a pretty sweet day."
Unfathomably awful. It's a miracle that we somehow managed to make it to Austin in 16 hours.
Completely sucked
22 hours to get to Waco. It was a very terrible experience.
How much rain did Rita bring into Houston? It didn’t seem like much.
"We tried to head East. It took us 15 hours to get to Winnie, turn around and came home  now if we ever need to leave again we will leave days out."
Took us 14-16 hours to get to college station. What a waste of a day
"For one - totally unnecessary for us, but me & son took the 2 cats to Hillsboro where SO was working. Drove all night up Hwy 36 to Hwy 6 thru Waco. There was a stretch thru Rosenberg where the stop lights held up traffic for over an hour. There was no cross traffic and the local PD did not take over to get traffic flowing. Got home a few days later and one branch from one tree was on the road. No other damage on our block. No flooding either."
"Day? You mean days? Plural, not singular."
I was leaving with my dog and daughter head to San Antonio took 1.5 hours to drive in other times 15 minutes I was afraid of running out of gas turned around back home in 15 minutes didn’t even get a drop of rain had to water my outside plants the next day
We left and we were stuck in traffic for two days straights. Good thing is that we had three drivers in the car and we stopped in San Antonio and chilled out with some family.
"I wasn't evacuating, I had planned a road trip (going via Ft. Worth) departure for that date about a month beforehand, and stupidly thought I could beat the traffic if I left at 3am.  I honestly did not expect the mass evac that happened.  My friend and I sat in traffic for 8 hours to only make it as far as the woodlands.  I remember leaving my car to walk off the freeway and pee in the woods, came back to my car which hadn't moved an inch.

At one point we found a gas station that didn't have terrible lines, there was an unattended moto at the pump and then I would be next in line.  I looked for anyone in the register line wearing a shred of leather, found the motos owner, told him I would pay for his gas at the pump.  This was the only station we had seen all day that had not run out of gas, and I was worried it would run dry while I was waiting for that guy to pre-pay for fuel.  So we successfully got gas and back on the road.

We gave up around the woodlands.  My friend's parents had friends who lived up there but were out of town, and I guess they told us where the key was hidden because we stayed the night at their house.  The next morning I pulled out a paper map that I kept in my glove box and marked off some tentative routes that could get us to Ft. Worth without hitting the interstates (we were going much farther than that, but I knew traffic wouldn't be an issue after DFW area).  I called the sherrifs dept in each county we would be passing through to verify that the roads in question were open.  We made it out the next day with no hiccups, by sticking to surface roads.

Funny enough, it was that situation that opened my eyes to the fact that if there ever is a disaster affecting a mass area, *you aren't going anywhere.*  I subsequently moved to Chicago, where the avenues out of the city are even fewer (the lake blocks the entire East side of the city).  I had a decent emergency stash to ride out various emergencies that may arise, which meant I was sitting pretty on a pile of N95 masks when Covid hit."
"Lousy. It took us about 8 hours to get from the Heights area to where 290 and Highway 6 meet in Hempstead. That's where we turned on Highway 6 to head to College Station where we stayed with family until the storm passed. My wife was about 34 weeks pregnant, and we drove (on the rare occasions traffic moved) with the windows down and A/C off to conserve gas, just in case. There was another 3 hours or so of driving on Highway 6 to get from Hempstead to College Station, so 11 or so hours in the car, total.

This is TMI, but I put a 5 gallon bucket in the Suburban before we left. My wife kinda made fun of me, until we hit 3-4 hours of sitting on 290, she really needed to pee, and there was no bathroom in sight. Yay 5 gallon bucket.

0/10, do not recommend."
I was 15 years old and my grandfather lived in Galveston. I had to helped him bored up his house and then evacuate. Took us 30 hours to get to Austin to my uncles house. Absolutely miserable.
13 hours to get from 45 s/Edgebrook to Katy
"From east Houston to Livingston took us 16 hours, we got bounced around by an 18 wheeler driver who was tired, no damage thankfully, at night saw a car slam another car into an 18 wheeler and the driver come out and stuff the 24pack of beer box in the trunk, ended up in school shelter to ride out the storm, left first thing in the morning and made it back home in 50 mins, one of the first people in our neighborhood to be able to come back, saw a lot of cars abandoned all along i10 I was 10 at the time, so it was a pretty crazy thing to still remember"
Took my wife 14 hours to get from League City to Kingwood. I had a critical position at a natural gas pipeline company in the galleria area. Took me an hour to get there at 2 AM since I knew back streets. My wife was still stuck in traffic while I was heading to work.  I left there around 9 AM and using back roads made it to Kingwood in about an hour. She was ready to choke me when I said traffic wasn’t so bad. Lol
"It was miserable being stuck on I-45, I was only like 9 years old at the time but I’ll never forget thinking that it was chaotic. Cars being abandoned, people using the restroom out of their vehicles, and the scorching heat. After being in the vehicle with my family after so many hours, we only got to near Huntsville and couldn’t find any gas station without bags on the pumps. Now as an adult, I wish that I could say that I’d never evacuate for a hurricane but a tree ended up falling on top of our house so probably good that we left lol"
"Oof, reading this thread is bringing back so many memories of that day. We have family from New Orleans that evacuated for Katrina to Houston, and we were intimately aware of the situation there, so we tried to evacuate.

My mom is a public school teacher, and her district didn't let out until the day before Rita made landfall. Our neighbors left at like 5am, but we didn't leave until about 8-9am. No AC to conserve gas. We did stop once in the afternoon, just because we stumbled across one gas station that still had gas, and figured we should fill up again just in case we weren't able to fill up again. People were just standing on the side of the road, pissing, taking their dogs out, talking, abandoning cars. Our dog freaked out and crammed himself under the passenger side seat, and we couldn't get him to come out. 

Then our neighbors called us. We asked them how far they'd gotten, since they left about 3-4 hours before us. They said they were back home 😂 they hadn't gotten much further than us, before they gave up. So we decided to just go home and ride it out together. 

We were on 249 North for 8 hours, then turned around and got home in 15 min."
"Flew back in from North Carolina to Houston from a work event and saw the entire city of Houston lit up red from brake lights from the sky. Will never forget that, it was wild. We were late to the evac game since I had been out of town. So, by the time I got back and we packed up l, we were already screwed. We only left because we thought our crappy little area would be a war zone if shit went south and looting broke out. Woke up early the next morning, tried to pull money from 6 different ATMs with no luck and left 1960/45 area and headed west. Slept on the side of 1-10 with my the boyfriend, dog, 6 guitars, a full cab and other “essentials” in a 2001 Honda civic hatchback for a few hours. We tried every back road we could think of, and inevitably were routed right back to the I-10 contraflow hell. Spent 4 hours at a gas station somewhere outside Sealy waiting for gas. Had to drive another hour past San Antonio to find a hotel. Slept in a Walmart parking lot until the room was available. That was a total of about 32-36 hours. It’s also fuzzy because I had strep and an upper respiratory infection and was so doped up on OTC meds and struggled to stay awake. We ended up staying in that hotel for 4 days waiting for the traffic back INTO Houston to be manageable. 

I vowed then I would never leave again, and stuck with it until I left the area a few years ago for good. Stuck through all the others, including Ike (that was a rough week) and Harvey (lived in Montrose for that one)."
Had some friends who evacuated together as acquaintances. They’re now married.
Made it to my friend's brother's place I'm Dallas in 8 or 9 hours. We went the back way via College Station. Our friends who tried 45 made it 2 or 3 miles in those 8 hours. They turned around.
"It took my brother and I about 13 hours to get to Mexico when normally it would take about 6 hours. I was a freshman in high school and all I really remember was everything being at a complete standstill. Gas stations were out of gas, it was pretty hot out, and a part of me hoped that we’d all get out of our cars and have a party on the freeway (must’ve watched too many music videos growing up). Honestly I thought it was fun because it was out of the ordinary, but I was like 14 and had a small view of the world so I didn’t realize how much of a bad time it was for others."
"I was in high school and remember my dad saying we weren't leaving till a cop knocked on the door and told us to, which we did. It took us 30 minutes to drive from the southeast side to Atascocita, where we stayed with family friends for maybe 2 days."
"shit show.  but the choice was easy.  my bff's in-laws in Dallas had a 7 bedroom house, pool with a cabana and a fully stocked bar.  I emptied the freezer and we grilled and drank for 3 days.  the 10 hr drive to Dallas sucked....."
I turned on thr TV at 4 am and saw all that traffic.  We stayed in our home. One of the decisions I've ever made.
I remember sitting there with my parents headed north on 45 and traffic wasn’t moving at all. We had the radio on and the radio guy started saying that they had just announced all southbound lanes were available for heading north now. I saw a bunch of cars jump to the other lane right then and my dad did the same. We had barely made it to Willis from Conroe in about 2 hours at that point. What a fucking mess
"We took the HOV lane out, which some parts are on a ramp with cement dividers only made for one lane and an emergency shoulder. We couldn’t leave early because my boss made me work. Some asshole decided to bring his giant RV into the HOV lane and got stuck because his shit was too wide for the lane. So many cars were then stuck because there was no way to get out with hundreds of cars all backed up behind everyone. Spent 8 hours stuck there with two cats and a dog. I hope that asshole learned his lesson, though I’m sure he didn’t give a fuck."
"I was a kid and remember waking up at 4am. There was traffic in the freeways already. My dad decided to avoid huge roads and take back roads. We got to Oklahoma in 10 hours. Most hotels were booked along the way and we decided to get as far as possible.
We had Dennis for breakfast the next morning"
I was in the backseat playing Pokémon fire red without a care in the world
We were under a mandatory evacuation in Pearland. It took 9 hours to get to my mom’s house in Richmond. We took 90 the whole way. It would have been faster to walk.
"The school district closed at 2:00, I was on the road by 3:00.

I drove 45 mph or slower to Austin. Everyone on the road had either very small children or very old parents with them. Truck stops were very busy and I stopped for gas 3 times. It took hours, but it was ok. 

My parents left the next morning at 5am. They drove less than 5 miles in 2 hours, turned around and went home to ride out the storm.

We all live on the Northeast side of town."
Hell
Spent 16 hours in the car for a normally 4 hour drive
"Lol we evacuated to north Houston area for Rita. We lived in Texas City at the time 2 blocks from the water. It was hellish getting there for sure, despite leaving 3 days before."
Terrible. I had to pee in my dogs water bowl in front of my family.
I remember seeing dead dogs and pets lined up on the side of the road. It was hot that day. I had my dog in the car and got scared.
Took me 17 hours to drive from the Heights to my cousins house in College Station. 🥴
"Took me 6.5 hours to get to ColdSpring, TX where my parents lived. We bought the last gas in town and went to hunker down.

Then the storm went further east than anticipated and we experienced high winds and the full hurricane experience. At 3 AM the roof of the house next door came off and crushed my parents garage cover.

We waited until noon the next day and bugged out back to our house in League City where we had power and everything."
"We(high school me, my mother, and my grandmother) lived in Waller. The earlier projection had it coming SW of Houston and then heading towards College Station which would have put us in the direct path. My uncle came and picked up my grandmother to get her out of harm's way as she would have been very uncomfortable if we lost power for any extended time. They left Waller before sunrise and made it to my grandfather's house(they divorced 205 years prior) near Logansport, LA just before sunset. A normally 4 hour drive took over 12.
The next day, the storm shifted and ended up running straight up the state line and was still damaging even that far up. They ended up without power for a week at grandpa's. After about a day, uncle took them to a hotel in Tyler. I sat on the back porch in Waller and played internet games while watching the storm pass us well to the east."
"For those of you who experienced Rita, how bad did the weather end up getting? I wasn't here in Houston during Rita, so I don't really know."
"Absolutely miserable. 6 hour drive took 25. Felt like I could've walked faster.

Only saving grace was that nearly everyone else stuck in the mess was cool. Everyone was frustrated,  but seemed to miraculously realize that we were all in the same situation. 

Honestly, at this point anything less than a solid 4, and I'm not leaving again. I'll send the wife and kids inland, but days in advance. Personally, I'd rather ride it out. 

Trees are all trimmed, solid (new) roof, house didn't flood, even during Harvey, and plenty of supplies. I'm set."
Took 20 hours to get to Dallas from East Houston
Took my family and I 12 hours to get to Waco. I recorded the whole day on an old VHS.
"Left my office, car ran out of gas on 45 and I walked about 6 miles home in a suit and heels 😑"
"We were down in Webster in a mandatory evacuation zone. My parents had a camper and we took it. My mom for her birthday asked for one of those massive Texas map books that shows every road down to just about pig trails. 

We used that to wind our way south first then go through subdivisions, backroads,one road that was a dirt trail through a field that may have been private property, and managed to make it to San Antonio in about 8 hours because of that map book. 

It was extremely stressful and poorly thought out. We had packed the family photos and our computers because under the prediction our house was supposed to be 5ft under water. 

And then nowhere near the disaster predicted. Then of course Ike came next, no evac and ripped the roof off our house, and there were so many trees down my dad was driving around with his sawzall for days after it."
I was lucky to be in my car for only 12 hours with a cat and a dog.  Many were much less fortunate.
I was in Austin at the time but my friends that drove up from Htown to crash at my house had to detour from Sugar Land to College Station to Austin.  I can't remember the exact time it took anymore but it was either 8 hours or 12 hours.
"We like everyone else were trying to go to Dallas but we didn't even make it past Spring and i took hours. We had our pets, and my elderly grandmother in the car (RIP). She was getting really pale in the car and so we pulled over the first chance we got. We found a store near a gas station and begged them for any help for grandma we could get, and they actually let us stay with them!"
"We drove down to Houston from Austin to pickup my dog from my grandpas house and my aunt because we didn't know any better back then. We live near Mission Bend. We never did that again as leaving took too long lol.

I remember it took probably about 4 or 5 hours for us to make it to my uncles place in Cameron TX. 

Ike we lost power for about 5 days. Didnt lose power during Harvey. We got a generator during Ike and we still have it to this day."
36 hour drive to San Antonio
AWFUL. I believe we drive from clear lake to downtown in 7 hours.
"It was the closest I've come to experiencing a real zombie scenario.  It's also the only time I gave up following the rules and drove on the shoulder to escape the endless sea of cars running out of gas and becoming stranded in the middle of the highway.   Even after I escaped the mess, every single gas station I visited was closed or bone dry.  The last few were just full of panicked, desperate people who were getting dangerous.  The last gas station I drove by was actively being looted for supplies and I got out of there fast.   

It eventually occurred to me that most of the time, shipping roads will run parallel to highways, so as a last ditch effort to find gas, I took the first exit I saw and traveled perpendicular to the highway hoping to find a gas station that everyone had passed up.   It was the right decision because I found a calm, normal gas station less than a mile from the chaos I had left behind.  They had gas, moonpies and big-gulps, and I stocked up.   I ended just using the shipping highway as far as I could, because it was completely empty!  I guess no one had considered it for an evacuation route.  

I got all the way to college station and friends without further incident."
Stayed and drove ATV’s on Katy Freeway the next day because it was an absolute ghost town.
Fucking terrible
9 hours in the car and didn't even make it to Rankin road from katy.  Turned around
"I didn’t evacuate… I chose to stay. I remember I was on my way to work and decided to put gas in my car because there was a bit of a line and I am a freak about having gas in my car. 

I went to work and we closed early. We chose not to evacuate because my dad had a flight from Miami arriving and we didn’t want to leave without him…
Yes, his flight arrived and he drove home (southwest Houston).

I ended up loaning my car to a friend and her mom who wanted to evacuate and bc my car had gas.
It took them over 24 hours to get to Austin. Everything was gridlocked. I boarded up the house as best I could which was actually quite difficult. 

Lots of people and pets died. Cars were abandoned bc they broke down, ran out of gas. People were dumping their water out to fill the jugs with gas. 

Then it barely even rained."
"It was when my college parent's weekend was. So my mom was supposed to drive from Houston to Memphis that weekend to be with me but she decided that wasn't a good idea. 

I was little upset at the time (though I'd never tell her) but in the end I was glad she didn't because she would have been stuck in traffic and have never made it. 

As it was she stayed home and experienced slight rain and a small breeze.

What people forget is it was literally like right after Katrina so everyone who wasn't used to hurricanes was scared shitless."
Faster to walk. Could barely get out of neighborhood. Parentals decided they would rather die in the house than on the road and turned around.
"My own experience: we had a toddler and a baby. We had just moved into a new house, but the old one was still vacant and under contract. We had two cats. 
So: do you pack up kids & pets & worry about what you left behind? Or do you stay and hope you can endure? 
We decided to try to go to our relatives near Dallas. Packed the car with essential paperwork, a few items of emotional value. From the Heights, we immediately hit heavy traffic (it took hours), and before we reached Beltway 8, someone rear-ended us. It could have been SO much worse, and the driver was so apologetic. But with two tiny screaming kids and two cats in a damaged car, we decided to just turn around and stay home. As I recall, it stormed, but our area was spared the worst of it. 

What sticks in my mind about that period is the day or two before, and realizing what is critical in my life, and what is just replaceable stuff. And the fear and uncertainty making the decision to go or stay; even with plenty of resources and insurance, it’s terrifying to leave knowing you might never come back to what you left."
Hot minivan. Hours just to get to the freeway. Stopping at mattress Mac and getting the best hot dog of my life
Pure hell. Just tow end up right in the eye of the storm 🥴
Fucking terrible. I remember that
"I lived near Baytown at the time, and the forecast put me right on the edge of the flood zone. Plus I lived right on a creek in an area that was prone to flooding, so my wife and I made the decision to evacuate westwards, to friends we had living in Seguin. [I had a short blog post about it at the time](https://www.kpcnsk.com/?p=96), and the main takeaway was that it was a really long day. Fourteen hours for what should have been a three hour trip. But we also got really lucky. Our car was a diesel VW Jetta, so in addition to getting high MPG, we were able to fill up at a gas station where that's all they had left.

We got stuck for the longest time on an HOV overpass just east of Katy, and just east of where they eventually opened up the contraflow lanes. Our lanes started moving while the main lanes were still gridlocked, and when we had the opportunity, we jumped into the left lanes of I-10. It was surreal, not only because we were driving on the left, but also because we were moving while all the traffic on the right was stopped. I was grateful, but it also felt wrong. Lots of people jumped the median, so now they have the barricades stretching between Houston and San Antonio.

While we were stopped on the overpass I got out and walked around, talking to others like everyone else. I met someone who had their family in the car, as well as their dog. The guy claimed his dog had died. I was a bit in shock, but they guy shrugged his shoulders and said, ""that's the way it goes."" That was the most horrific part of my experience.

Mostly people were friendly and helpful. The day was a clusterfuck, but people made due."
Like hell.. took me 24 hrs to get from Clear Lake to North side of town & ended up in a hotel.
I was very young then. I learned that you get out as soon as possible when they very much mean a bad storm is coming.
This evacuation took me and my family 17 hours to make it from Galveston to Dallas. We left on evacuation day about noonish. I remember hitting the cuts in Houston. Some roads were blocked off with unattended barricades. Knowing the Houston roads put us several hours ahead most others that were stuck on I-45. This drive is the main reason I like 4X4 trucks. Watching the folks in Conroe exit the freeway and hit the feeder while I was stuck in traffic( in my front wheel drive) was an eye opener.
"Had a great GPS and was able to get off the highways and take the backroads to Livingston after only threeish hours, where we were promptly hit by the hurricane, all while our house south of Houston had seven small limbs downed and zero other damage."
My parents attempted to evacuate up 59. They left from the Alief area and after 9 hours they had almost made it to Humble. They turned around and stuck it out.
"It took 9 hours to get 35 miles only to end up in a parking lot just north of Greenspoint. We ran out of water, gas was dangerously low, and one of our 2 dogs died of the heat. Didn't run the a/c to save on gas and with the windows open the exhaust fumes made us sick. The drive back to Sugarland took 45 minutes. I'll never do it again. 

On the bright side everyone was kind to one another, and helped where they could. It brought out the best in people."
"My roommates left, while I stayed. They got stranded on a chunk of highway where some damn med transit bus... Blew up? The oxygen tanks or something went bad in them. Long story short, they were evacuating from a hurricane that barely touched our side, so they could get stuck in their van on the highway for like 13 hours."
"I drove around North Houston the day of ""landfall"". It looked like an apocalypse but you could get anywhere you wanted to go (nothing was open, there was no where to go) in a fraction of the time. You didn't even need to stop at lights or stop signs. It was like the beginning of COVID."
"It was WILD. I was working downtown as a tech at the BMW dealership. 

I had their roadside assistance vehicle and I started getting calls for people running out of gas. The operatorn would ask ""how long until I could arrive"" and I'd say something like ""between 2-7 days"" 😂 
I just ended up turning off the phone, as I knew I couldnt be useful with anything on that front. The dealership offered $500 cash to come down and help move cars into the shop. I had a motorcycle at the time so I figured I could bomb down there and back pretty easy. I decided to take Hardy down from spring, and the southbound lane was literally empty from 1960 all the way down to 59. I didn't pass one car.  People were just sitting on the center divider watching me- northbound lane was gridlocked, no one was moving for hours. I made it from 1960 to downtown  in less than 10 minutes 😁😁😁
Once we moved all the cars we could,  I decided to take the HOV back up 59.... The HOV turned into a log jam around the 610 area, so I backtracked to the last exit and street fought my way up 59 and back roads to 1960- all roads north and I mean *all roads* north were filled with traffic. Gas stations out of gas turned into refugee camps where people were essentially using the pump as a shelter. Cars were out of gas *everywhere*. I remember after the storm the national guard driving around filling all the cars up with the big tanker trucks. 

It took me over 2 hours of driving in the grass, over curbs, between cars, lanes, etc to get back home. 
People didn't see Intersections any longer, they were suggestions. There was no law anywhere. You could do whatever you wanted. It was bananas.

I went up to 45/Louetta bridge overpass and tried to help with people getting to the south side of 45 for contraflow- most cars got stuck in the grass trying to drive over it which was also very entertaining. 

Other than that, spring didn't get destroyed by the hurricane for the most part- obviously a ton of flooded cars .... For me short of a fence getting blown over and no power for a week it wasn't bad."
"Like everyone else in Houston, we were spooked by the recent events in Louisiana and so we joined the evacuation. It took us nine hours to get to Dallas, using mostly back roads. Four of us plus our dog. Finding time to stop and walk the dog was no problem because we were stopped all the time. 

Shoutout to the Plantersville police and fire departments. The firehouse near the 105 opened its doors to the public to provide shade, water, and restrooms. The police got officers out to the intersection to help move traffic faster. 

After it was over, I was amused by Houston leadership's declaration of the success of the evacuation. No, it was a debacle. More people died in the evacuation than from the storm."
"Took my husband 18 hours to drive from Spring Branch to Dallas. He was working in Houston and I was still in Dallas. He couldn’t go to work because his job was located in a mandated evacuation area. 

When Ike rolled around a few years later, we were both living in Spring and had my elderly mom living with use. Hubby couldn’t evacuate because of his job, but he insisted that my mom and me evacuate to Dallas. I said hell no, I’m not getting into a traffic mess like you did during Rita. Before I knew it, he had emailed a couple of plane tickets for us to fly to Dallas."
"Since this was 1 month after Katrina, my parents thought it would be a fabulous idea to evacuate to Louisiana where we had family. They kept reiterating that it was north Louisiana so its safer from a hurricane than south Louisiana. To me it was still Louisiana. What usually takes 5-6 hours took 26 hours and I developed a bad knee.

I was a freshman in high school and I remember my friends and I texting and IMing each other how much we love one another and to be safe. We were all fully prepared to never see each other again.

Random note: fast forward to 2020 and I'm ironically living in that same area we evacuated to and experienced my 1st cat2 w/ hurricane Laura and i got to be in the eye for the 1st time as well.

Coming back we saw many SUVs abandoned and every road and highway was empty. We came home and discovered we never lost power once. Then my poor cat got an upper respiratory infection since he was around my aunt's cat.

My parents never learned their lesson and forced me to evacuate with them for hurricane Ike. Pretty sure we were the only ones in Houston that evacuated for that one."
Oh. My. Goodness! I can't imagine being in that situation.
"My little brother had diarrhea. He was maybe 3 years old. We convoyed in two vehicles with about 10 people including the kids. By the time we got to my great grandparents' house in the Tyler area, he was wearing someone's shirt with safety pins somehow holding them on and all his clothes had been left roadside cause we had no other way to deal with that hell in the 12 or so hours we were on the highway in near standstill traffic."
21 hours in my F250 with a pregnant wife and 3 year old to only make it 40 miles from home. We finally turned around and went back. Worst trip ever.
"A 58 hour sleep deprived nightmare. Watch folks draw guns in each other. 

Shit on the side of the road

An ended up in a town that took the eye of the storm. 

Did CPR on some dude at the hotel
When we finally got there who decided to try and swim. Drunk. Even though he didn’t know how to swim 

PTSD."
"And do forget, it did not hit here.  People just freaked out post-katrina.  Evacuate Katy!"
"Spent 6 hours going from Seabrook to Montrose

We took back roads the entire way also, every freeway was pretty much at a stand still."
"it was scary… saw people driving (nay flying) in the oncoming traffic lane on country roads… other people with cars and families broke down on the side of the road… it was a dark dark day… and we were lucky ones, only took 4 hours to get somewhere safe"
"I tried to get out of town with my cat because my mom was panicking about me staying on my own in Meyerland. I didn't get far and was almost out of gas after several hours. I called a friend and he said I my cat and I could stay with him. He also let another friend come to stay as well (she's a chef which is important later). I picked her up and we cleaned out our refrigerators and went to our friend's place. When nothing happened, she cooked everything and we invited some other friends over and had a feast."
"I was very young but I could remember the chaos when evacuating. My parents ended up running out of gas , ditching our car on the side of the road & hitching a ride back home. Idk what happened to the car till this day but it was replaced. 

&#x200B;

So much for evacuating lol"
"I lived in the Galleria area at the time, it was wild watching everyone overreact to a cat3 cause cat5 Katrina had just wrecked NOLA. Galleria area is 60 miles inland! 

I bought a bunch of discount meat at Kroger, they were trying to clear inventory. Cooked some meat and enjoyed a rainy day at the house, wasn’t bad at all. 

I took a stroll down the middle of Westheimer before the storm made landfall cause there were almost zero people left in town, no cars. Felt like a zombie movie, was super surreal."
"We lived in Katy then in the Cinco Ranch area. It took us what seemed like 3 hours to get from our house to the Merrill Center which is usually about only 15 minutes away… 

I remember distinctly telling my dad that at this rate, we’ll be stuck in the car when it hits so worst case, we  either die in the car or die at home 😅 we drove home and roughed it out. While Katy got some damage, it wasn’t anywhere as bad as the coast - so we were honestly very blessed."
"I was a Junior at U of H, living on campus, while my family was back in Port Arthur.  There was initial hesitation to leave because the last time we had evacuated (can’t even remember the storm) we went all the way to Austin and the only weather they got in PA was a regular old thunderstorm.

Eventually my Mum decided it was prudent to get out of Dodge but she definitely didn’t leave as early as she should have.  It took longer than expected but eventually she and my 2 brothers & sister made it to the apartments to scoop me up.  

I had a backpack ready for a quick overnight stay, no entertainment readily available, but figured I’d just be sleeping the trip away.

To compress the longest part of the story, it took 17 hours to drive from UH to The Woodlands Mall.  Gridlock was an understatement - my brother and I were literally on 45 N dribbling a basketball, to get a reference for how thick traffic was.  Contraflow wasn’t even an idea it seemed so you had the  northbound lanes at 110% and southbound COMPLETELY empty with the exception of a random law enforcement vehicle every once in a while.

Mum had a used, not well maintained Ford minivan and several hours into the trip it overheated and we had to pull over for a good hour for it to recover.  Cell phones were useless paperweights, as every provider’s (2G at the time) network was at max capacity.

Eventually she was able to get through to my cousin who lived near 45/1960 and we were extended an invitation to ride it out at her apt.  The 5 of us occupied the living room and spent the night through what ended up just being moderate rainfall.

We found out Port Arthur was an absolute ghost town and many of the ones who stayed took pleasure starting arguments with the frustrated parties who chose to evacuate.

I’ll never forget that evacuation and have always strived to keep myself in a financial position to be able to leave at a moment’s notice in case of emergency."
We left a couple days ahead of time and watched the shit show from Dallas.  Unbelievably stressful even from a distance.
🤣
I went dove hunting. There was a line of cars evacuating as I got out of my truck dressed in camo with a shotgun. Got some scared looks and lots of windows rolled up.
"Late to this post, but I was a kid (7f) when we evacuated. I remember standstill traffic.  My dad was in his truck while my mom, me, my brother (2m), and 3 cats were in the car behind him. Nobody knew how long the traffic was going to last or when we'd be able to get gas again. We were on the highway not moving for many many hours, so eventually everyone turned their cars off. It was HOT, the cats pissed, my brother was crying, and I didn't understand why we couldn't just keep the car on for the AC. My parents were convinced we were still in danger of flooding where we were (ecavuating from Beaumont) so there was palpable anxiety. My mom was rationing water for us but didn't have enough for the cats (nobody planned to be stuck on the road this long) so she sent my dad to walk around and look for a puddle or something to get water for the cats. A pregnant lady came by and asked for water and food, I don't remember if my mom gave her some or not but they talked for a while. Eventually we started moving but I remember we left at like 5am and the sun was setting in my memory of us finally being on the highway but idk if that's totally accurate. 

I remember it being kinda scary but mostly annoyed that we couldn't turn on the AC or get out of the car to play, but looking back I feel so bad for how scared my parents must have been."
"Evacuating wasn’t too bad from what I remember, I was 13 at the time.  On the way back it was terrible.  In stalled traffic for like 2 hours I ended up having to get out of the car to go shit in the woods and use notebook paper"
"Agh don't even remind me! 

We were in dickinson Texas. It was my aunt, 2 female cousins, one was 7 months pregnant. And their 2 boyfriends. 

For some reason we were all scared it would flood like it had in Katrina in New Orleans. We put all our furniture high up as much as we could. Like the couch on top of the diner table etc. We were all scared our cars would flood too. And I think most people were thinking the same and added to the traffic. 

We left around 1pm to Livingston tx to one of my other male cousins who were staying there at the time with in-laws. But about an hr into traffic on i45, they called us saying we could come stay, idk some bs. So we decided to head all the way up to Dallas because every hotel room north of Houston was booked in advanced. So we headed from clear lake to Kemah to take hwy 146 because we thought somehow it would take less. But every road was the same. 

From there I just remember I was driving in bumper to bumper traffic. I was driving alone in my 97' blazer. We weren't the only ones traveling in groups. People would even put socks on their antennas so they would show how many of them were in a caravan. So people were getting very aggressive with the ones that wanted to drive on the shoulders or mediums to cut in front of people. One group in a pick up was threaten me because I didn't want to let them get in between me and my cousin in front of me. I didn't know where we were going, my cousins bf was leading and I was the last car. So I didn't want to loose sight of them. Some traffic lights were being respected, some barely. 

We were also worried about fuel. All gas stations were packed and a lot out of gas. We did get to refuel though a few times thankfully. Cell phone connection was a huge issue. Around that time most of my cousins had sprint phones that could work as walkie-talkies and those sometimes worked. Only my phone with Verizon worked for some reason. But would lose signal often. 

It took us about 30 hours, from 1pm to about 7pm the next day to get to tyler going through Crosby, up to Livingston then Nacadoches, taking back roads when we could. 

Once there we rented this old house from my cousins bf family for the night at least. Over night my truck got broken into and my phone stolen, because I only had a car charger. They went through all my stuff though that I had packed. 

The next day we left back when people started saying it didn't cause much damage around dickinson. And the way back it took us like 6 hrs, many people started heading back but many still stayed out at least another day or more because down south by the coasts it did cause more damage. 

The next evacuation for Ike wasn't as bad. The evacuationplan was better organized by then. We left to Austin and only took us about 5 hours, when normally would be about 3 or less. 

Hope I never get to go through another one. And I'm hoping we are at least as organized as last time, even though it was already a long ago if there is a next time."
"My friends and I tried to go on a roadtrip to visit our friend in Amarillo.

Didn't really work out so well. So we uh.....""entertained ourselves"" in our friend's van for several hours.

Then we went home, and it took us 5 minutes to get back.  
LOL"
"I was a young kid when Rita happened, but I still remember we managed to make it to La Grange and we ended up hunkering down there as a last resort. We left a bit later than we probably should've and the entire experience was absolutely miserable. Felt like we were in the damn car for eternity.

My family and I haven't evacuated for any other hurricane or tropical storm since, including Ike and Harvey, but we consider ourselves lucky that our street and house didn't flood during Harvey but some houses a few streets down did."
"Good example of the madness of crowds…. 

And how incompetent or malevolent “authorities” can scare people into endangering their lives - by following the directions of “experts” and “authorities”

Anyone else see a repeating pattern???"
"This pic alone brings gives me PTSD.... Driving and running out of gas was out biggest fear, it took us almost 9hrs to get to San Antonio from Katy... And that's normally a 2hr drive, I was prepared and had extra 5gal tanks in both cars. ... 

Looking back, we should have stayed home.  We were far enough inland, but it was our first hurricane since moving to Houston and the weather man made it out to be something it wasn't..."
"I was in 4th grade and the school us told the day before it hit and sent us home early. My dad had just left for the airport for a business trip. We called him, but he had already landed. He booked a flight the second he got off of the plane and came back home, we stayed home and didn’t evacuate. Then the next few days we found out it missed Houston and turned into Katrina."
"It was shit. Hot as hell, had the dog in the car, the car died. Ended up in Hockley."
I left Sugar Land w my kids at 7 am. No traffic. Stayedin Waco. (Nice little zoo there btw.) Neighbors sat in traffic five miles from here overnight. No damage. Didn’t even lose power. We never do. Must have a big shot in the neighborhood?
That looks like every day houston traffic
So much traffic. Took a day to drive to Austin. I was small so I can’t remember much but I should have evacuated for Ike because Rita didn’t do much damage where I’m living at.
"Stayed during hurricane Alicia 1982.  The eye passed right over the house.  Seeing the wind stop, things got real quiet and when the wind reversed trees went down and all wooden fences.  No flooding or damage to my home.  Lived in Sugar Land during hurricane Ike, 2008.  Amazingly house was very quiet inside during storm.  Trees broke apart and my neighbor across the street had a really big tree go down and did immense damage to their house.  I had no damage to house.

Moved to the coast and was living right on the water during Hurricane Harvey in 2017.  Was a cat 4 hurricane  when it made landfall over Texas and Louisiana.  We got 55""-65"" of rain in a fairly short time.  Lived on a canal that fed right into Galveston Bay and the water never accumulated."
It was hell on Earth.  Over 24 hours to get to Dallas.
16 hours on the road due north on 45 and we made it to Huntsville. We slept in the parking lot of the Walmart in Conroe.
"I spent eight hours on 59 just going from the Beltway to Will Clayton (that’s like 3.5-4 miles). We could’ve literally crawled on our hands and knees faster than traffic was moving. 

I said fuck it, turned around and went back home. Rita blew over like a fairly intense thunderstorm— but we had no damage, no flooding, no loss of utility service."
*days
"10 hours to get to Livingston. I remember coming home right after and seeing thousands of cars on the sides of the roads, from so many running out of gas. It was an awful experience."
"It felt about how it looks. Rush hour traffic all the way to Dallas, took like 16 hours from Spring. 

It was our first hurricane so we had no idea what we were in for. Even with a direct hit we should have stayed put, and we did for Ike."
We hunkered down. Lost power. Everything in town was shut down.
6 hours from hwy 6 in sugar land to Kingwood. 24 total hours to Little Rock - storm was worse there than home. Fuckin hell
8hr drive from Texas city to Baytown driving up 146.
My family drove for 10 hours before turning back around and making it home in under an hour
Wouldn't have been as bad if the State Troopers would have stopped opening up the Houston inbound lanes to outbound traffic only for every other municipality to force all traffic back to outbound lanes only. Traffic would free up for 10 miles and then you wouldn't move again for a few hours. If they would have kept them open a certain distance and then force everyone back to normal lanes and leave it alone traffic would have been MUCH better. I swear we split and merged I45 6 times on the way to Dallas. We left from the Woodlands and it took 24 hours to get to Dallas.
"Drove in a convoy with my folks. They had packed their shit up. I basically had nothing. My Grandma rode with me and had to pee the instant we started moving on the beltway. 

We're in the Bay Area and headed towards friends in the Woodlands via the beltway. That route kept us clear of the absolute nightmare that was 45. Truthfully, it wasn't that bad for us. My buddy and his family went north up 45 and got stuck in the shit. Lost two cats. Ran out of gas."
Hope yall stay safe out there
"Was at home, woke up to my mom telling me to get in bed with her and my dad I had a huge hole in my ceiling"
"Left for Austin at 6 am. Made it in 2.5 hours. Friends that left at 10 am, took a whole 24 hours."
I super lucked out and already had plane tickets to Dallas for a wedding. Left my husband at our apartment alone. He said it was awesome though. Empty streets. Only place open was Specs.
[deleted]
"My friend spent over 12 hours getting to San Antonio which was apparently speedy at the time. My late husband and I sat on the covered patio drinking wine, calling friends to see how far they had gotten, and guessing the speed of the wind gusts. 

It would have to be a massive storm for me to evacuate. Rita taught us all a huge lesson."
"Got 2 miles out after 2 hours, gave up and figured we’d rather drown at home than on the road."
Sat in traffic with my mom and sisters for 24 hours over 2 days to get to my grandparents house in Shreveport. Normally this drive took just under 4 hours. We got hit harder by the storm in Shreveport than our house in Houston did. Fun times
Just like that picture
I remember being on the road for 18hrs and only making it 30mins from our house.
Spent 28 hours to get to Austin. We waited for our evacuation time too. Last timeme and my family do that.
"We decided to go stay with family friends in Little Rock, which is an 8 hour drive from here. All I remember is that we left from home around 8/9 pm and reached the Brookshire Brothers in Livingston, only an hour and a half away, the next morning. Bumper to bumper traffic."
Took 12 hours to get to San Antonio. No where to park at gas stations. Men peeing on the side of the road in the wide open.
"My parents drove for two days and ended up just over the border in Louisiana, I forget the city. Of course Rita turned and they ended up being closer to the eye than if they just stayed in Houston."
"I was with my parents who were living in Brazoria County at the time and looking a direct hit.  I drove one car with my brother and my parents drove another with the dogs and the camper. We took back roads through Fortbend county over to 71 and I went to Austin and my parents and brother went to canyon lake. 

It took 5 hours to get to Austin, which isn’t great, but wasn’t crazy either. We left early enough we didn’t see any of the true craziness. I remember being completely stopped on alt. 90 for a bit. 

I had family members who left the same time we did, but took the interstate and ended up taking 10+ hours to get out."
"You had to decide between turning on the car to stay cool but running out of gas, or keeping it off and scorching in the heat.

I want to say more people died from the evacuation than from the actual hurricane."
Spent 8 hours in traffic where it normally takes MAYBE 30 minutes the same distance. Ended up turning around and going home before we run out of gas with 6 kids in the car.
"12-ish hours from Pearland to Austin. We left on the last evacuation day, which I want to say was a Wednesday. I just remember how eerie and still it was. I’d never seen Houston so empty."
Memorable
"I remember it being humid af and spending the entirety of the daylight hours in my car, only to say fuck this, turn around at Gallery Furniture and get back to Alief in 20 minutes."
Drove for 12 hours to get from Montrose area to about “1 hour” north on 59. About 800PM Rita was turned right so I busted a U turn and it was amazing being the only one driving the opposite way and going 70 after going 5 for 12 hours.
"We waited until the morning it was supposed to hit to leave. So much on the news about traffic, people running out of gas, cars catching fire etc. By the time we left, all the traffic was gone. It only took us 3 hours to get to Austin, but we drove with the windows down to save on gas."
It was hell. We left I thought early enough but I was wrong. A 6 hour trip turned into a 36 hour or 48 hour trip. All gas stations closed. The state of Texas dropped the ball in not closing I 45 south in a timely fashion and have people evacuating  on both sides. The state of Texas closed rest room facilities in rest areas. I saw a young girl sitting in a vehicle holding a small baby crying. I saw an old man trying to get an over heated car cranked. One major lesson is evacuate early. Have plenty of water and food. Before you leave clean out your refrigerator and freezer.
"I consider myself lucky, since I came home to Houston in 2018, the worst I’ve dealt with was the freeze in 2021"
"I was a kid then, we had a full tank of gas, but we spent so much time on the road that we eventually had to turn off the A.C. We were a family of seven so all of us, plus bags, PLUS my dog...It was hot cramped, miserable... Add to that, our dog (RIP ReyRey!), started getting nervous farts due to the overall energy of the car😭🫠. It was bad! 

Eventually, my dad couldn't take it anymore and gave up on fully evacuating. I'm not sure how we got out of the traffic (my dad might have done some not so legal maneuvers), but we managed to get to my aunt's house who was closest to where we were. They had planned to ride it out from the beginning. Once we got there it was actually a lot of fun, my cousins were our age, and we were childhood friends, so it was like one big sleep over (I have so many stories and fond memories of that night).
 
Eventually the house lost power, and my parents made the decision to leave as soon as the rain lightened up. The roads were abandoned, a ghost town. It usually took us 30-45 minutes to drive back from my aunt's house in the suburbs of Cyfair, but that day it takes like 15 minutes. Ironically, our house still had power."
"My husband was a teen and said they sat in traffic for 6 hours, then turned around and was home in 20 minutes."
"I waited a couple of days, then did the speed limit all the way to Dallas. 45 looked like a disaster movie."
"We used the back roads to get to the north-west of town. It felt like we were a mile or two ahead of every warning of heavy traffic that we heard as we made our way to family in College Station.  Even afterwards, when all the gas stations along the major routes were out of gas, we managed to find a place on a lesser-used road and got back home with no problems."
Took us 8 hours to get to Dallas.  Through the back towns and such. Coming back to Houston everything was pitch black.  We didn’t have light for 2 weeks.
We were on the road 14 hours and made it 20 miles. Turned around and tried again the next day lol
Nightmare. Evacuated to some friends in Arkansas. Normally a 6-7 hour drive took me about 20
Took 6 to 7 hrs to get to Austin took a lot of super small back roads normally takes 2 hr 40 min.  I had my laptop with a Microsoft map program and was able to take the back roads with this program.
"From Pasadena to Katy: 14 hours

Turning right around and going back to Pasadena? 45 minutes."
"My spouse was overseas on business. I called him to say come home now about three days before, but he was busy and didn’t realize how bad it would be. So he came home two days later as the storm was about to make landfall.  The buses to parking had already closed at IAH which was also closing, but he was lucky to hitch a ride to his car with a business associate. By the time he got home, the roads were already packed and he wanted to sleep. I was watching the freeway cameras for Hwy 290 to Austin, and around 1am the road looked clear. We loaded up our two teen sons and dog, got my elderly mother to drive to our house (heavily treed Willowbrook area) and left in a three car convoy around 2 am.

It worked fine until about 15 miles out, then looked like the apocalypse.  Standing still traffic—we moved about 3 miles in an hour. Cars on the side of the road out of gas, people sitting on their trunks wondering what to do, all of it under sodium lights that made it look hellish. Everything was jammed up to the bridge over the Brazos. There’s only one in that area, so it was the clogging point. After a few hours we finally made it over the bridge, the took the next backroad and hightailed it over washboard dirt roads at 3-4 am. Finally made it to Austin about 9 hours later where we stayed with a friend. 

Came home three days later to find (thankfully) no damage. Ike dropped a tree on the house and Harvey flooded us just enough to gut the lower half of the house though."
"It was stupid.  I moved a mile and a half over a couple of hours.  Did the math, realized I'd be halfway to austin when the storm intersected with me, turned around and enjoyed the gentle thunderstorm in my apartment."
We saw the traffic and hunkered down. My oldest was only 6 months and very impatient.
"We left the house, made it 4 blocks and into a traffic jam.  The guy on the radio said I-10 is solid all the way to San Antonio so I went by the liquor store and back home.  Lost 1 branch off of a magnolia tree."
"We live northwest of town in a rural area and we had decided to just hunker down. I went with my mom to go check nearby convenience stores for ice. We got near 249 and were gobsmacked to see it was a parking lot, people walking up and down the side of the road, cars stopped all over. We turned and went home, figuring if there was any ice available those folks would need it more than we did."
12 hours to college station. The chicken express was a beacon in the night. My 88 year old grandmother was a damn trooper.
"It took me 22 hours to drive to Dallas. Almost ran out of gas, spent the night in a Taco cabana parking lot, and enjoyed driving north in a southbound lane. My mom was freaking out about a ""prophetic"" dream she had of a giant tidal wave crushing our house. Nothing ended up happening aside from a power outage and some downed branches."
Imagine that situation with todays ev’s
Family friends drove up from Alvin to my house when I lived in Central Texas for a time. They were on the road for 25 hours straight IIRC.
"I had a broken foot at the time and my mom had no interest being in the house with teenage me during a hurricane when I couldn't walk. 

So we went to stay with family north of Dallas, I can't remember which day exactly we left but I do remember it took us ""only"" 8 hours and I vividly recall listening to traffic reports about the wave of cars behind us. Like we were in Conroe and the report was 4 hours from Galveston to downtown, just past Madisonville the reports were 3 hours from beltway 8 to the Woodlands - things like that. We didn't stop for gas until we were in Dallas proper. If we had left even an hour later I'm pretty sure we would've been caught in the traffic jam."
"14 hours to Denton Texas, bumper to bumper even on county roads, something that would normally take 3 hours. Just chaotic overall, it was like a scene from an apocalypse movie."
"I stayed lol, had fun tho"
"We were scheduled to fly out of IAH for vacation right when it was supposed to be hitting Houston. Got our departure flight changed to DF/W and planned to drive there to catch our flight. Tried taking back roads, gave up after about 10 hours and turned around, I think it took us about 20 minutes to get back home."
"I left a couple days before absolutely nothing happened, early in the morning. Took me 14 hours to get just south of Fort Worth. I saw cars overheating, assholes blocking emergency lanes, and regular joes with big trucks moving concrete barriers to open up the southbound lanes on 45 to northbound traffic. I had put a leash on my cat's collar, attached to the backseat, so she wouldn't crawl under the brake pedal, and made a mini-box for litter from an old baking pan in the back floorboard. Next time, I'm staying put."
It took 8 hrs to get to Austin on 290. And ppl where driving in the shoulders and ditches.
12 hours from Angleton to Conroe
"I had co-workers who lived north of Woodlands - basically 100 miles from the gulf - who didn't even lose power for a minute, but spent 24 hours sitting in their suburvigator because they tried to evacuate to ""anywhere but here"".

If that picture was taken from a couple exits further up, I probably would be able to pick them out LOL"
"We went east, didn't know Rita would turn late. Every county we hit turned in mandatory evacuation. I had to go back to get work friends that stalled out in Lumberton, and when I exited to go get them, they turned 69 into all going north. We were on the road in 2 vehicles for 26 hours with a 5 yr old, a freaked out cat, 2 extra passengers and their stuff that we could fit into my vehicle plus all of our stuff. We made it to Fairfield. 26 hours...... to get about 2.5 hours away from our home. We didn't let that deter us from Ike evacuation. We just left later, smooth sailing to San Antonio that time."
"It took us 4 hours to get from Katy to Sealy 

Edit: I don’t remember when we left. I was a teen at the time"
23 hours Houston to Austin
"Group panic happens.
Learn multiple ways through the city.
Plot your Texas tour based on needs. My tía needed dialysis. We toured multiple dialysis centers across Dallas, Taylor, Austin, San Antonio, and Victoria before we returned to Houston."
Awful. My family headed towards south central Texas but not before boarding up or home here. My father sliced his hand open on those hurricane clips in the process but refused to get it looked at until we had made it to safety. Hours and hours on the road going nowhere fast. I believe he finally got stitches at a hospital near Victoria. I took a nap on a bench in a Walmart pharmacy at one point. When we finally made it to our destination many hours later we sat around with family and watched it miss our home completely. Haven't evacuated for a storm since (Ike/Harvey/Imelda) and probably won't again unless staying behind is almost assured of death and destruction.
"I stayed in my garage apartment in Montrose and I was grateful it was a nothing burger. But then there was Harvey, which damaged my home and I had to sell it at a loss because I couldn't afford to repair it."
"Oof. Many many hours sitting in a car. We left earlier than most, and it took like 8ish hours to get to Austin."
"This submission has been randomly featured in /r/serendipity, a bot-driven subreddit discovery engine. More here: /r/Serendipity/comments/18l24ob/people_that_evacuated_for_hurricane_rita_what_was/"
18 hours of misery to San Antonio. We were maybe 10 miles away from an empty tank + going full Mad Max
I remember driving for 23 hours straight that day and I believe we made it to Tulsa
Took 15 hours to get to San Antonio and my college roomate and I were in Huntsville. Everyone fled to Huntsville and it got some damage and was a wreck after people left. Then we had rolling blackouts for a month…. Fml
"Hell. Ran out of gas midway heading to Tyler,Tx"
I was in Willis watching from an overpass.
"It took me like 10 hours to ""drive"" to Conroe from south Houston. While sitting in the i45 parking lot I ran into a band I used to see weekly at last concert cafe and smoked a joint with them. The freeway was at a standstill it was like a tailgate"
"Watching Tim Heller ABC13 weatherman draw a straight line on the map, that showed it was coming directly towards Houston... Great day indeed."
19hrs from Houston to Dallas in a sedan with 3 adults and 3 children aged 10-13. We didn’t turn the AC on to save gas. I was one of the kids. I just would have rather be hit by the hurricane at home. We never evacuate anymore.
We drove to Corpus. Took 4hrs on backroads from Dickinson.
I stayed home.
We were in clear lake.  We waited till the storm was making landfall and drove to our hotel in downtown.  The city was completely empty.  We didn't see a car from nasa road to downtown...wild.
I was a kid but iirc it took us like a day and some change to get to Dallas. Three big things happened. One was a guy on a bike pulled up beside us and turned out he was an emt from an ambulance parked on a service road. He gave us water. Second was my dad got into a fist fight with some guy road raging lol. Third was at one point my dad’s leg cramped up so my mom drove and my dad laid on top of the car. Not fun
We left early and it still took six hours to get to San Antonio.
"It was horrible. I was working for a law firm at the time. And we were expected to stay till the end of work day. Meanwhile, people everywhere were frantic. The stores were bare. Gas stations had long lines and ended up running out of fuel. There would be “end of times” signs posted. It was so chaotic!

I originally was planning to stay home and ride out the storm But my fiancé wanted to leave. Unfortunately, what is usually a 30 minutes drive, turned into a 4 hour bumper to bumper stall and stop. We ended up at a family’s house in Tomball, Texas to ride out the storm."
"I was 6 and we evacuated from Port Arthur. The traffic was terrible, just like this pic. It took us about 18 hours just to get to college station. A lot of roads that would have been less trafficked were closed off and everyone was forced to take the designated evacuation route. Most gas stations on the way were out of gas. Also, FEMA had booked up the majority of available hotel rooms in Texas to help Katrina evacuees, so we ended up staying in cots at a church in CStat for a while. At the same time, my grandmother was in the hospital and was about to have her leg amputated. The National guard was transporting all the hospital patients and they refused to let families know where they were taking them. My grandfather worked hard to convince them to let him go with her, but he didn’t have a cellphone to communicate with us. So the whole time we were evacuating, my parents/family were trying to track them down. Eventually my grandfather called from a hospital in Little Rock, and after we were able to go home, my parents went to take care of them. I was a carefree 6 year old happy playing with a toy monster truck the whole time, but my parents were stressed tf out lol"
So horrible we moved to Dallas 6 months later so we’d never have to do that again.
Chaos
Took 17 hours to get to Dallas… more people died on the road that year than casualties from the hurricane itself. I’ll never evacuate again lol
"I don’t know why this showed up in my feed, but I lived in Aransas Pass during Katrina and Rita. For Rita, we evacuated towards San Antonio. I don’t really remember much, but I do remember we had the hardest time finding a hotel, and traffic was a nightmare."
"I can't say how long it took as I was just a kid at the time, but I do remember the traffic. My parents, our dog and I were loaded up in a vehicle.  I remember we had pulled off the road just to sleep because traffic was at a standstill. Left from closer to the gulf, not a houstonianian here but had to take houston evacuation routes ofc. We went to Palestine, TX to stay with relatives and our neighbor (who didn't evacuate) called to check on us and invite us to a BBQ. My family stopped evacuating for hurricanes after this, we stayed for Ike and Harvey."
"I was in college in a northern state. I was calling my family every 10 minutes because the news were making Rita more catastrophic than what it turned out to be and I had a really severe storm phobia so I was really worried.

Finally my aunt had to tell me to stop calling, they're fine. I didn't sleep a wink either that night for fear of what could happen."
Took four times as long to get to San Antonio. But at least we made it.
"I credit my dad for his navigations skills. Evacuated to Dallas, waited till a day or two before it was supposed to hit, took may be 7 hours or so to get to Dallas (normally take \~4). Once we got to i-45, passed Conroe, which took forever, my dad pulled his ATLAS (anyone even remember that?) and a giant map of Texas, and took us away from the interstate into backroads and there was hardly any traffic and gas stations had gas where we filled up.

I had family that stuck to I-45 and it literally took them 22 hours to get to Dallas."
13 hours to fort hood from east Houston. Paper maps and back roads. We had a 4 car caravan and it honestly was not that bad compared to other’s experiences.
Went to a family friends house to wait it out. Ended up being the right and fun choice lol
"I was doing real estate at the time so I had maps in my trunk. After sitting in traffic for 2 hours and only getting to 290, we used the maps to take side roads to Dallas. Took 12 hours."
"We did not evacuate for Rita. We had already driven to Biloxi MS to evacuate hubby's elderly aunt and uncle for Katrina, had them at our house in Houston. We felt pretty safe, and we had no issues during the storm.

But I watched the news (big mistake, talk about upsetting and stressful!). The traffic jams of people evacuating were so bad, people were running out of gas on the road, abandoning their vehicles, creating a worse traffic jam. Then people started dying from the heat/humidity. The final estimate of deaths from the evacuation was over 100.

The reason the jam was so bad was there was no order to the evacuation. Everyone from Beaumont to Katy started out at the same time, hit the roads, and came to a screeching halt.

This is why we have evacuation zones now. All of the variables are tracked -- where the storm might come ashore, where the storm surge will be bad, what roads may flood early, etc. Then evacs are called by zone. This does two things -- helps get the people at highest risk out first, and helps prevent the gridlock of Rita."
We had the windows down to conserve gas coz we didn’t know If we were gonna make it and gas was on short supply. It was a hot day but I spent most of my time playing Gameboy and crossword puzzles
"Was stuck on a city chartered evac Greyhound bus for the better part of a week.  
Mom didn't have a reliable car at the time, and we lived very close to the coast.  
Took 2 days just to get to Conroe, then the bus continued on to Lufkin, then a Christian Dude Ranch(a story in and of itself) for a day or two, then finally to Orange until we were dropped off at a Red Cross Shelter.  
At that point my mom and several other folks from our area managed to pool enough money to rent a van to drive back home.  
Prior to experiences in my military career, it was one of the shittiest adventures of my life, and the dirt in the wound was that Rita didn't even really have much impact in our area.  
The only reason the evacuation was so out-of-hand was because Katrina was so recent, so everyone panicked."
Katy should evacuate now!
"I worked at the Star of Hope at the time and I had to take a busload of residents on a bus to San Antonio. It took 18 hours. Before we were out of Houston (but had already been on the road about three hours) someone on the bus had a seizure. I directed the bus driver to pull off to the nearest hospital and when we pulled up, all the women started to get off to have a smoke break. I had always tried to be the chill staff member who didn't pull rank, I was in my mid-20s and most of the clients were my age or older, but I found my voice that day. I said ""Listen to me. I am taking her inside, signing her in and dropping her off. When I get back on this bus, it will leave. I am not counting heads, I am not taking names. If you aren't on the bus when it leaves, you will weather this hurricane on your own."" They all took their cigarette breaks with one hand on the bus. When we finally got to San Antonio, I got off the bus and vomited from stress.

&#x200B;

We were gone for 8 days and I was on the Nancy Grace show talking about it. We had an outbreak of scarlet fever. We were staying at a convent with nuns. It was a nightmare. It's also some of the most fun I ever had."
I stayed home and it was a bit breezy 😂
We didn’t evacuate specifically for this photo.  I cleared out the closet under the stairs and we slept in it.  That is the strongest part of the house.
"I didn't evacuate. Instead, I was burying my grandfather the day the storm was to make landfall, down near Galveston."
"My son was born 9 months later June 22nd.  The few days after Rita in Houston were the best,  no trafffic, no people, no noise.  Then everyone slowly came back."
Brooooo THE Worst!!! Spent about 30 hours on the road from I45 @ Scott until we hit maybe Huntsville. Slept in a Walmart parking lot 45 minutes outside of Dallas  the next night due to a flat tire. Stayed in Dallas two days and when I get back found my apartment robbed and ransacked.
Didn’t evacuate. Dad was a building engineer at a mall. We spent the time in their engineering room in the parking garage with our dog… actually went on the roof while it passed over… rather uneventful
"Took 17 hours to get to Austin. Departure from Eldridge and 6.

I will always respect Home Depot on the way. They were the only shop that kept their restrooms open for the people fleeing Houston."
"I really want to know what was at the front of that line. I have been it that type traffic, and still don’t understand what people are doing when they drive."
We halted out at the ford stadium. Got out played football exchanged snacks with other Houstonians after about an hour of a complete stop reality set in.. we were 5 hours from being hit with absolutely no movement. The Same small family we exchanged snacks with decided to drive off of the freeway into the feeder.. my dad frustrated & life long road rager decided to follow our 5 car fulls of family jumped off as well.. we drove the opposite direction and made it to our home in about 15min.. we live an hour away from that location 🤦🏽‍♂️.. decided if we were going to die it would be as a family… we didn’t die.. we were literally outside during the eye of the storm….
I'm from Surfside and as a kid it was chaos coming up 288. We went to Tomball and found a hotel. I remember my dad driving on the exit embankments to get up in traffic.
"We never made it to Dallas. After 15 hours, we ended up in a small ass town called Crockett and met up with some people out there. It was like 9 adults and too many kids in a 3 bedroom house. Somebody was sleeping on every sq ft of that place."
“A day of hell”
Chaos. I remember it like it was yesterday.
That was a terrible experience. Nobody wanted to take a chance after Katrina. I saw some things that I wish I hadn’t being stuck on the road. 6 hours and we only made it about 40 minutes outside of Houston.
I stayed home and got pregnant
"I was a kid, but I remember being stuck in traffic crying thinking the hurricane will get us if we don’t hurry. We went to my dad’s cousin’s house down in the RGV. It barely rains over there. A hurricane is rare."
"I remember that. It was anarchy on the north side, Conroe area. 5 gallon limit of gas. Chaos!"
