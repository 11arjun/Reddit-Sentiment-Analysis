This hurricane is a monster. We are so lucky it didn‚Äôt hit us. Everyone be ready to help our friends to the East. They will need it.

Man not even a little windy in NW Houston. Weird to be so close but so far.
ate all of my hurricane snacks...time to re-up before heb close at 6
Crazy to think Laura could strengthen to Cat 5 per SpaceCity
"From Canada here,  


Just wanted to wish all of you the safest of safe possible through all of this. The news coming in up here sounds scary."
Houstonians very lucky right now but doesn‚Äôt put me in a celebratory mood.  Horrible for those on the Louisiana coast who get displaced for probably months. I can‚Äôt imagine. Be safe everyone
We should collectively buy the guys at SpaceCityWeather some beer for the work they've put in to keep us all informed.

My girlfriend overnight shipped me my old glasses but they won‚Äôt arrive until 3 pm. I need to be out the door by 9 am the latest to go cover the rescue efforts.

I'm glad Houston isn't getting hit but feel bad for Beaumont and surrounding areas. üôè
Just a reminder to my fellow potheads: Now is a good time to re-up.
LA has the Cajun Navy and they saved our ass. Where can we look at whats needed for these people? They are getting hit rn but they will need money and personal labor soon. Where can we sign up to go help? An hour/two hour drive isn't shit to go help these people that saved us during harvey

Joel Osteen locking the doors up right now.
"It's been said elsewhere over and over again, but holy crap are the public comments on all the major news outlet websites disappointing.  If you never explored beyond those comment sections, you'd think Houston was just overrun with the biggest illiterate, unscientific, non-critical-thinking population imaginable.  I've read over and over and over again from every news-affiliated meteorologist stating that we wouldn't know enough about Laura's track until Wednesday, so do what's best for your family and heed the warnings of local officials.  Err on the side of caution since ""we just don't know yet.""  But every moron seems to be popping out of the woodwork declaring ""I knew this would be a non event,"" and loads of fun </s> blatantly racist remarks about BLM and ""Dora"" ruining everyone's week.   Maybe it's unsurprising that the most vocal among us are also the dumbest among us, but man is it depressing seeing the trash spewing out of people's virtual mouths in situations like this."

"Seeing how powerful this kind of storm is made me realize I need to consider finding some place besides home to safely ride out a direct hit Cat 4/5 hurricane. After Rita, I'm just not sure it is possible to evacuate a city the size of Houston, but would not feel comfortable staying in my home, even though its a sturdy townhome complex. 

Was watching Piotrowski last night and they seemed relatively safe inside a multi-level concrete parking garage. I might keep my eyes open and try to find something similar in my area, in the event that I don't feel comfortable staying home, and evacuation is impossible.

Any ideas? Where would you go if you had no choice but to ride out the storm?"

Should we rule out power outages for North/ North East Houston? There was a huge hype over this possibility earlier this evening but it seems like Houston will not get any effects at all.

Sooo... has it rained around y‚Äôall yet?
Well looks like we're safe.
Anyone else just experience a strong gust of wind near the medical center? For a few seconds the rain was going almost horizontal and my deck table ended up in the pool

Is it looking like the bulk of the storm is going to mainly hit Louisiana now?
"Watching all the tornado warning from the lake Charles nws kind of reminds of Harvey's dirty side. Iirc only a couple weak tornados actually touched down. (I remember one north of bush? And one in sienna?)

Oh man. Jennings is in the warning? I actually stopped there a while back on a road trip at a taco bell."
There is a lot of water down in the Strand in Galveston https://www.galveston.com/webcams/strandvideocam/

So are we in the clear for sure now or is there still a chance it turns back towards us?
"Of course, the hurricane with the same name as me is the one that is apparently rivalling Katrina. Yaaaaaaaay"
"Coming from South Florida, it is baffling how blase everyone in this city is about hurricanes. We don't panic in Florida either but we take storms very seriously. Yes, Harvey flooding was awful but its a completely different threat from true hurricane force winds. Not that winds are worse, they're just completely different. But everyone around me was 'we didn't flood during Harvey we are fine'. I think I was the only one in my neighborhood who actually got plywood despite there being 50 million trees everywhere. Do people really think their buildings built under the shitty Texas code will hold up to a hit from a Cat 3 eyewall? Come on..."
So it's no longer going to hit Houston it seems like?

So I am supposed to go on a business trip tomorrow and fly back Friday. What are the odds flights get cancelled? i dont mind going but I also dont want to be stuck in a hotel with no way home till everythings clear.
"Bellaire, clear skies as of 9:32pm. I anticipate some rain tomorrow or Friday with the backside tail."
Anybody heard anything about Port Neches/Groves?
"My lady friend was mentioning on the phone last night british news outlets were reporting this storm as a cat 4, but that american tv stations were only reporting cat 1-2 to not get the general public panicking. Welp, woke up this morning to forecasts saying ""potential"" development into a cat 4 storm. What happened between 7pm last night and 6 am this morning? -_-"
I‚Äôm in central Louisiana. Hands down the worst fucking hurricane Louisiana has ever seen. Luckily NOLA missed it because I believe it would‚Äôve wiped that bitch out completely
"I'm in alvin, which is probably closer than most of you.  The wind jussst picked up a little but it just mainly is making it nice to sit outside with all the neighbors.   Stay safe everyone"
Stay safe houston fam. With love from Austin
Can anyone elaborate on why it is spinning northwest but all the models I have seen say once it hits land the path is going northeast. How does it change that drastically and miss us?

Are tolls still waived? Heading back from Dallas today.
Are we only on the outskirts of the hurricane? It‚Äôs not hitting is directly? I still have Harvey PTSD

Why are all of these comments immature?
Planning to head to bed early and catch some middle of the night action. What time do you guys think would be best to set an alarm if I wanted to see some wind here and watch the weather channel people in lake Charles? I know landfall is around midnight but I‚Äôm guessing it won‚Äôt reach any place where the weather channel is hunkered down until several hours later.
Is it out of the question that it turns towards Houston?
"Dumb question but when will this ""clear"" the houston area. Thursday afternoon?"
"I live on the west side of downtown Houston, and was planning on flying out tomorrow morning at noon. I have up until an hour before the flight to cancel and have been trying to gauge the best course of action, because I'll be leaving my cat home alone for a few days until someone an come check on him. 

It's sounding like I shouldn't have anything to worry about at this point? I can reschedule the flight but it's gonna cost an extra like $240. It also sounds like we should know by tomorrow morning if this thing is really going to affect us any more at that point, yeah?"

Does anyone want to tell a story about a hurricane that shared your name so you had to endure stupid jokes about it?
"Hey All, greetings from from smokey Northern California.  My wifes aunt lives in Cullen Park.  She is elderly and lives alone, does she need to evacuate? Thanks for the help, and stay safe!"
Watching channel 2 right now and it‚Äôs starting to get pretty crazy in Lake Charles.
So did it pass yet?
when would it be safe to travel back to galveston? i just moved in this week and i start school monday and i just wanna officially move and unpack :(
Figured y‚Äôall would enjoy this mad man in the eye of the hurricane. The legendary Jeff Piotrowski. [live stream ](https://twitter.com/jeff_piotrowski/status/1298843535089647616?s=21)
I have been watching the hurricane progress on [Ventusky.com](https://Ventusky.com). It is so fascinating looking at the wind speeds from different altitudes. Some really crazy swirly things going on that would be down right pretty if not so down right terrifying and destructive.

What happened to all those evacuation routes?
Southwest Here. Nothing at all besides some low winds.
If you have a car consider moving it somewhere that doesn't flood
"I am in South Florida where we have seen our fair share, just curious, are there any codes or insurance you have to adhere to like impact windows/shutters and strong roofs? Just wondering.............. i have a bomb shelter basically at this point but have evacuated for storm surge before. I don‚Äôt mess around. Hope everyone stays safe."
Does anyone know how bad it will hit harris county

"Well, I guess something finally beat Audrey, and about the same path as well."
Does anyone know if i10 east and west thru lake charles is open?
"About how accurate is the projected path of this hurricane? I know no one could have a definite answer to that. But I live in a house that probably isn't too stable, not enough to withstand a hurricane. I live in southern Pennslyvania. The hurricane is supposed to brush by, but I'm scared it'll go up further. Is this likely?"
"So, is there a map app that shows the roads in Houston that are flooded?"
We just survived the unsurvivable.
"I have an online exam at a Pearson Center on Saturday in Uptown, what do ya'll think I should expect? I called the center and they said they would let me know as soon as they do, but won't give me an idea of the likelihood. Is it likely centers of the sort would close down or there would be power loss that prevents testing?"
Hey y‚Äôall. Does inside the loop have power? I‚Äôm deciding whether or not I want to head back tonight or tomorrow.

I think someone needs to stop Eric and Matt. At this point I think it's kind of a point-of-pride street cred thing that the hurricanes all aim at Houston because they know that this is where Eric and Matt live. It would be better for them to just shut down their website.

"What‚Äôs all the fuss with this storm? ‚ÄúIt will disappear on its own. Keep the economy open. Go to the beach. You can‚Äôt make people evacuate, it is unconstitutional.

Looks like we dodged this hurricane. No rain at all on the northwest side so far.

it's not even raining here lol.
The maps for this hurricane make it look like it's going north and won't even really hit Houston. There's going to be a lot of disappointed people who bought stacks of water bottles.

Anyone think it‚Äôs going to hit Houston and they didn‚Äôt want to tell us because evacuating 7 million people during COVID is unrealistic? They put the cone just close enough to say oops.
