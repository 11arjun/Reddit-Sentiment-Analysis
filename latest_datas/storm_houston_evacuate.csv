"As a Houstonian I've learned, you either leave way earlier or you're not leaving at all."
"Went to east TX. Normally takes about 6 hours. I spent 21 hours driving a manual transmission vehicle, never getting past 1st. It was difficult to find fuel and there were vehicles being abandoned on the sides of the road. This is probably why they won't call for a mass evacuation again."
26 hours to Dallas. I was a kid so I don’t know the route we took but still it was something I’ll never forget. Left in the middle of the night
"We lived just off 45 near UH. We loaded up the day before landfall and tried to get to Austin with our cat. Over the next 7-8 hours we inched from 45 and Cullen to Beltway and 290. Finally called it quits and u turned to get back home. Went to grocery store which suprisingly wasn’t empty, stocked up on supplies and stayed up the next night to watch the storm completely miss us."
"My sister was living in Waco back then and I thought about heading up to her place, but I had the news on and saw how horrific the traffic was and decided to stay put. I don't blame folks for hitting the road, what had just happened in New Orleans with Katrina was scary as fuck."
I stayed home and watched the Lost season 2 premiere.
We left at 2am the day before and it still took us 13 hours to get to my Uncle’s house in Dallas.
"Fucking horrible, there was 7 of us in a minivan and we didn’t turn the AC on because we wanted to conserve gas. It took us almost a day to get to Hutto. Never again, I’ll just take my chances and stay at my house from now on."
"My gf and I spent 7 hellish hours driving from Clear Lake to Cypress. Our two cats, who hated the car, spent the entire time screaming and puking and shitting in their carriers. We ended up just going back after realizing it probably would have taken us 20+ hours to get to Austin. You could feel the collective white knuckle tension from the tens of thousands of people around you also stuck in traffic. In 45 years never felt anything else like it. There was also a worry that if we didn’t make it further quickly enough we could get caught on the road in the storm. 

They hadn’t opened contraflow lanes so it took us less than 30 minutes to get home. Spent the next day drinking beers and riding our bikes around the ghost town of our neighborhood."
I lost one of my best friends due to his stress levels when stuck in the Freeway. His heart gave out. Had a 1 year old too. Tragic.
"This shit was why I always laugh at disaster movies where they're telling people to evacuate, cus I know what it would really look like. I never want to experience that again. 

The entire freeway was full including people using the shoulder, there was nowhere to go. No gas available anywhere. People just getting out and walking their dogs, talking and shit, because traffic wasn't moving at all."
"My family and I evacuated to San Antonio from Dickinson Tx in a kind of caravan fashion. It was the most brutal, apocalyptic 36hrs I’ve ever been through and the reason I won’t evacuate anymore unless I’m forced. And that’s 36 hrs hours spent on the road to go to San Antonio, a normally 4 hour trip. I peed in diapers because as an 8 year old I just couldn’t handle going on the side of the road. My aunt lost both of her dogs to stress. My uncle totaled his car bc he fell asleep behind the wheel, thank god he was okay. It was just really unorganized and frightening. My mom bought me shark boy and lava girl after because I was such a “trooper” through the whole thing."
"I’m convinced that part of the reason why no one evacuated during Harvey was because of how bad traffic was during the evacuation for Rita. 

also part of the reason why no one from the City of Houston or OEM sent out a mandatory evacuation for Harvey."
"My flip flop molded to the shape of my clutch. 13 hours to get from Lake Jackson to Cy Fair. I was in high school and my parents were out of town, my grandparents were watching me for the weekend. They wanted to ride it out but didn’t cause I was with them."
"13 hours from Richmond to San Antonio. Got there and went to Pat O’s. Drank Hurricanes and margaRita’s. Threw up in a urinal. Good times, 2/10 don’t recommend."
"Fucking terrible. My dog over heated in my car and threw up on me. Took me 6 hours to get out of Houston . Took me 12 hours to get to San Marcos.  Should’ve just stayed home. On the plus side I ended up meeting my ex wife who became my kids mom, so that was a plus sort of"
"I was a vet tech at the time. The amount of people's pets that died from heatstroke during the evacuation was really sad.

People were low on gas and with no gas available too scared to run their car's AC and some breeds just don't handle the heat well.

Also, my mom made the mistake of eating Taco Bell and got diarrhea and had to shit on the side of 59 with nothing by my dad holding up a towel to try to give her some privacy from the other drivers."
"I didn't evacuate, but I was working at a home depot on I-45 that day. Traffic was at such a standstill that people would leave their cars on the freeway and walk into the store to use the restroom and buy water. One woman was lying face down on the cold concrete floor. When I went to check on her, she said she was fine, but her car had no AC and the concrete floor was cooling her off. Her family was still in the car on 45 while she was in the store. 

When I drove home around 5 that evening, the backroads were completely empty. I'd never seen it that empty, complete ghost town. Such a contrast to the mass of cars sitting on the highway all morning and afternoon."
"My wife got a bladder infection because she wouldn't pee ducked down behind the car. 

It made me realize how few bridges there are across the Brazos River.  (Coming from Austin)"
Drove 12+ hours heading north on 59. Ended up on Palestine and stayed at an evacuation center there since my mom’s car overheated.
6 hour drive using nothing but back roads to San Marcos. 0/10 wouldnt recommed
"I tried to get out of town but after 8 hours and only 1960 to show for it, I said fuck it, I'mma go home. Turned around at Townsend and made it back the way I came in less than 20 minutes. I was resigned to letting the storm rage around me and let the chips fall where they may. Ended up getting a slight breeze and no rain. I watched TV until I got tired and went to bed."
I got to 45 with my dog and turned around.  Facing Rita was preferable to that bullshit.
"I evacuated my 83 year old grandmother who was in not great health. I had already spent time in Mississippi working the relief effort after Katrina and saw the fallout. I knew my grandmother could not survive that. My father and I rented a minivan and filled the back with gas cans and brought non-perishable food and water. I drove all night from Louisiana to pick her up. I took a 30 minute nap on her bed and said “let’s go.” 
It was pure hell. It took us over 28 hours to get back to North Louisiana. I only saw ONE cop car the entire way. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cars out of gas on the side of the road. No contra flows.  Every person for themselves. We got out to pee on the side of the road. People were wanting to hijack our gas cans. Thank God Dad brought the gun. It was pure lawlessness. The news did not report all of that, obviously. I was pissed they were saying how much law enforcement were helping out. Nope!"
This gave me instant ptsd. I was 17. It was hell on earth. It was hot as hell. It took 23 hrs to get from Houston to Austin. I got hit by an 18 wheeler out of anger. Ran out of gas at hour 18. Bathrooms and roadways were insane. I’ve never evacuated again after that. I’ve also relocated to Los Angeles.
"My parents got onto 45, took the next exit turned around and went home."
"Omg so not worth it. We went to my grandmother’s in San Antonio and the 3 hour drive took about 15. My brother had just badly broken his leg during football the week before and had to sit in the trunk of our Ford Escape the entire ride to stretch out his leg. Every bump we hit he screamed in pain.

Came home to barely a chair tipped over"
"26 hours to Brownwood. It was an absolute journey into madness. Broken down cars, people stealing gas from running vehicles. Urine bottles lining the road. My uncle lost his two Pomeranians because of the sweltering conditions. We pulled into a Walmart parking lot and I let my wife sleep. I was supposed to do the same but everything was so sketchy I stayed awake."
"I was about 13 years old riding in my mom’s minivan with our dog in the back and our cat in a cat kennel. I have a vivid memory of the cat kennel accidentally getting open in a gas station and I had to panic chase my cat under cars trying to not lose her. 

And while stuck in standstill bumper to bumper traffic, our minivan gave out and we had to call my Dad and brother, who were hours ahead of us after having taken backroads and thus had to backtrack to come save us. I ended up falling asleep in a fast food parking lot waiting for help to arrive and when I woke up, my uncles and cousins had arrived and I was in a Harley Davidson pickup truck driving through the grass medians all the way to San Antonio. 

Spent the remainder of the evacuationvacation playing Gauntlet Dark Legacy with other family friends that joined up with us."
"Absolutely surreal. We were some of the first to go through 45 in Conroe when they made it all one way and almost got in a head on collision. Took 12 hours to get to Dallas. People peeing on the side of the road, broken down, garbage everywhere. Slightly worse than today I suppose…"
I saw an old woman shit in the evac lane on i10
"Car overheated in traffic downtown Houston. Was a AAA member, they refused to tow or cover the tow I paid for (later claimed they never did that... still wouldn't cover expense when called on that - not a fan or customer of AAA since). Was also insured by them, had just renewed. Found out later they 'revised' my application for coverage to be liability only so if the car flooded it wasn't covered, then raised the liability cost to take all the money. Niiice. Nursed the car back to the south side of town, switch to another cramped two seater/no back seat car (that didn't overheat!). Got back downtown around 1am, traffic had cleared out until around the 610 loop on the North side on 45. It still took \~20 hours to a relatives house just South of Dallas (aching from the car with no room to stretch). I was awake around 48 hours. Luckily I had enough gas in my car to get 2/3 to Dallas, past the point where there was no gas. A friend went towards Beaumont then North, and as everyone in Houston was going North or West he had a much better experience.   


If a similar storm were heading here, I'd leave again even knowing it'd be a similar Fubar situation. Rita had a record breaking storm surge, something that'd have put more homes underwater than Harvey did (though different areas), with added wave destruction. We got lucky. Rita's low pressure bubble popped just before landfall (I'm very thankful for that), so Rita came ashore as a 'normal' hurricane and also missed Houston. I don't have a crystal ball, so I'd leave as it'd be hell to stay if it hit without more than normal weakening.  
As tangled as everything was, the only real fault was that plans for evacuation hadn't been updated to account for the huge increase in population. Until the Fubar happened there wasn't the political will to fix things so the folks who knew, couldn't. It took time to get it done, but the road situation (South bound lanes used for North) and getting Gas trucks and gas delivery to help stranded folks all did get done before the storm hit. That was really an epic and quick turn around from the mess at the beginning. I'm really sad for the elderly folks in the evac bus that burned. That's the tragedy I remember."
"My mom worked at Conroe Regional and wasn’t allowed to leave. They were bringing in people from heat stroke and CO2 poisoning from I45. 

I remember how TRASHED everything was afterward. Like wtf why do people just throw trash out their car window in a crisis? It was so trashed up in Willis."
"Unless you can leave Houston four days, maybe three days, in advance you're screwed."
"I happened to leave before the evacuation order and was annoyed it took 8 hours to get to Dallas. By the time I made it there and saw the news, it was already up around 14 hours...

I heard from a few friends that ended up stuck on the highway when the storm hit and just rode it out in their cars on the side of 45, one of them ended up doing CPR on an older guy that had a heart attack on the side of the road and EMS couldn't get to them. 

Our house lost a few tree branches and one broken window."
"I live in Sugar Land and was working outside Minneapolis at the time.  My wife was at home by herself, unsure whether or not to evacuate.  My supervisor had approved everyone from the Houston office leave to get home early, so I caught a flight about 10 am.  It’s a three hour flight from MSP to IAH, so arrival was around 1 pm.  The flight was nearly empty, with most of the passengers going through to other destinations.  As the flight was passing over 45, the pilot told everyone to look out the windows, either side, to see the traffic headed north.  IIRC, the southbound side hadn’t been opened yet as contraflow, but the northbound side was bumper to bumper as far as you could see.  There was a woman on board that, the closer we got to Houston, cried and sobbed louder and louder, such that a flight attendant sat next to her for comfort.

That’s the happy part of the story.  Once we landed, getting a taxi to Sugar Land was impossible for one passenger.  After about 2 hours waiting for a cab, eight of us banded together to take a taxi van to different destinations and share the fees.  The first stop was near 290 and BW8, next was a little farther south on BW8, then Highway 6 near Copperfield, then 6 and 10.  When we got to 6 south at 10, it was just in time to have the intersection shut down so people going north on 6 could make a left onto the westbound feeder for 10 to make turns without stopping, to get onto the freeway entry ramp.  We had to wait about 20 minutes, at the light, before the sheriff would allow us to make a right turn.  We u-turned at Barker Cypress and made a right onto 6 south again.  There was one stop on 6 around Westheimer, then the rest of us agreed to ride to the Fountains in Stafford and pay for the remainder of the fare.  At each stop, the driver picked up whatever was on the meter at that stop from each customer.  If more than one got off, they split the fare.  On the way to The Fountains, we passed within a couple of hundred yards of my house; rather than pay the full fare, I just rode on and split it with the other riders.  

Unfortunately for all of us, everything in the shopping center was closed.  When my wife showed up, there was one older lady left, so we sat and waited for her ride to show up.  It wound up taking over 5 hours to get from IAH to my house in Sugar Land, and we were going against the traffic flow most of the way.  My wife still talked about evacuating, but after seeing all of the traffic, I told her we were staying put.  Neighbors that lived around us had stories about driving west on 90A  and it taking 4 to 5 hours just to get to Richmond, which is normally less than 30 minutes."
"I live in a flood zone that was told to evacuate. Left southeast side of Houston at 3AM, got to the Northwest side of Houston 14 hours later.

The people in Katy that decided to evacuate and plug our evacuation routes can eat a bag of shit."
"It was an absolute shitshow. I didn't want to leave but my husband did. I lived in Clear Lake City when Alicia hit in 1983 and figured if I could make it through that one, I'd be fine, but we packed up and hit the Katy Freeway which was at a standstill. We finally managed to got off the freeway in Columbus and take back roads to Austin where we stayed until it was ""safe"" to go home. Never again will I leave."
Drove for 7hours but my elderly grandma couldn’t take it anymore - turned around and got home in 10 minutes
"My mother-in-law worked in Missouri City but lived in Willis (northern Montgomery County) and she went to work when we asked not to. I called to check on my in-laws, father-in-law answered, said that M-n-L just got home. She'd been stuck on I-45 for 22hrs in traffic getting home. 60 miles of absolute gridlock.

After Rita the state started creating hurricane evacuation routes, allowing both left and right shoulders to be used for evacuation and creating contra-flow lanes. That's also when we started seeing lots of hiway and interstate improvement projects."
"I was 21 during Katrina and Rita. Luckily, I was more interested in hurricane parties than evacuating. Did take us four hours to get food and booze, though."
This was also was about a month after Katrina. That contributed to the panic for Rita and people that wouldn’t normally evacuate wound up leaving that year.
"It took me 36 hours to get from Galveston to Tyler. We had to abandon one car in Trinity due to lack of gas. I created a pee device using a Swiss army knife and a plastic sport water bottle. I am a woman, btw. I was pleased with my innovation."
"Was driving limos back then. Spent the last two days ferrying rich people to private airports to leave.

We decided to ride it out until we realized that afternoon we had no food and everything was closed. 

Rolled a couple of joints with my brother and roommate and hit i10 in our cars that evening heading to our friends apartment in Austin.

I10 was a ghost town littered with cars. We never drove under 90mph. At one point we were getting passed by  state trooper doing almost 100mph. He waved and kept going. The most surreal part of that whole ordeal for us.

Spent the weekend partying and went back when things started opening up.

God I miss my college days."
"I stayed, and it was phenomenal. The entire metro area turned into a ghost town.  I drove through Pasadena and ran like 5-6 lights just for the hell of it, and we all know how present Pasadena police typically are, lol. I also drove to Sugarland from the east side in a little over 20 min. I was just hauling ass on the freeway, and there were very few vehicles on the road. I never lost power and had plenty of food at home, it was awesome. 

It was pretty baffling to me how the entire area vastly overreacted to Rita. I guess everyone was paranoid because Katrina had just happened. However, they all failed to realize that New Orleans geography is distinct and that it was bound to happen there unless they addressed their infrastructure.
There are most certainly areas of the Houston area that needed to be evacuated, but the way it was handled by local meteorologists was ridiculous and the entire thing turned into a clusterfuck for anyone who tried to leave."
"One of my classmates died from Heat stroke in his car trying escape, left a wife a baby behind in the car with him.

My family stayed put and were fine."
It sucked.  My youngest kid was like 3 months old.  It took us 8 hours to get to our friend’s place in Austin.
"I was only 7, but I remember the stress on my parents faces while we were lining up at a gas station near Dallas."
"I didn’t even leave, but it took me somewhere around 3 hours to make it to Tomball from 290/Hollister. Backroads the whole way, 249 was a parking lot. 

Told my boss I was working from home after that. 

Every gas station / ATM / grocery store around me was empty, managed to get lucky and catch a late night delivery at Walmart and get some food. 

Absolute shit show. Lost power for most of a day, bit of fence fell down, and a really crappy nights sleep. 

Pretty crazy watching all the transformers popping in the neighborhoods nearby from my 2nd story window."
Rita taught us not to ever evacuate the city en masse again.
"Just stayed and watched on news the cluster fuck then took a nap and woke up and saw the cluster even worse then turned of TV and watched DVD and drank and partied with neighbors and a few friends.

Been through too many hurricanes since the early 60's to panic and freak out. Did stock up on fuel for generator and batteries and ammo and water at beginning of season as always anyway as always be prepared."
"It took me 24 hours to get from Galveston to Spring. In the truck with two screaming cats. I packed bottled water, a few sodas and some granola bars. I kept headphones on to drown out the cats. Cut the top off of a water bottle to pee in, then I dumped it out the window. Luckily I didn’t need to poop. Not sure what I would have done for that. 

Mom left Clear Lake a few hours before I did, but really was only a few miles ahead of me. She stopped a few times for gas, snacks & bathroom break. I stopped once for gas and waited in line for over an hour. Didn’t even bother to go in the store. 

I saw the sun set at south 610 and sunrise at north 610. I never ever will evacuate again for a hurricane. Stayed home for Ike & Harvey. Sold my house and moved to the north after Harvey."
Local news was to blame. The repeated messaging was “if you can get out then might as well get out.” They changed their tune later.
My parents were walking around on 45 handing out apples and water bottles to people.. quite a few people died just sitting in traffic.
I didn't evacuate but boarded up the windows. It was so hard to find plywood so I wasted so much time and energy. After that I decided I will never board up the windows even if the hurricane is coming straight for me. That's why we have insurance.
"We left the house around three.

We had barely hit Conroe at midnight.

Also my grandma from Mexico was visiting for the first time in years so at least she got to experience the whole thing with us lol."
Does anyone else try to spot their car in these Rita traffic pictures?
"Lord, it was a shitshow. My inlaws lived near Galveston Bay in the mandatory evacuation zone. They packed up their RV, picked up my grandpa in law, and headed to a private campground somewhere outside of Huntsville. We lived in Southwest Houston then but I was recovering from surgery and my doctor said that I needed to evacuate too because of the potential loss of infrastructure. My husband and I were going to leave the next day because he couldn't get off work, and meet them at the campground. The inlaws took the freeways and main roads and were stuck in the evacuation gridlock for like a day and a half. I had my road atlases and Key map and we took the back roads, even cutting through forestry service roads in the Sam Houston forest at one point. We got there in about 5 and a half hours. They had only been at the campground for about an hour when we got there, and they had left a day earlier."
"Got shot at(kinda).

We lived in Katy, and Grandfather lived in La Grange, so we went northwest. Took 2 vehicles, Dad driving my truck ahead while I drove with Mom and the pets behind. Stuck to the back roads, north of 10, and made decent progress for a couple hours to about halfway point then stopped. Two lane road backed up going into a little town for miles.

One thing that sticks out from there, our progress measured in yards per hour, was all the water from the air conditioning, combined with the sun, started to melt a strip from the asphalt. Every car wound up with asphalt stuck to their tires there. 

Eventually a group of people started to go contraflow, hopping into the other lane to just make progress. My dad pulled the truck out, my mom and I following behind. Suddenly Ahead of us a guy gets out of his truck, lifts a rifle and starts firing rounds above the incoming traffic, pissed we were bypassing the line. Mom screams, because she saw in the truck ahead of us my Dad lifting his shotgun and point it at the man thru the wind shield.

They had a stare down as he drove past, then quickly we followed behind and headed down the road.

All in all it took around 8 or 9 hours to make it to La Grange."
"Getting into the MadMax evac was waaaay more dangerous than the storm. 

A lot of people died on the road. No one was killed by the storm."
"I live about 30 ft from Galveston bay 

Rita evacuated to grandma’s via back roads. Wasn’t too bad drove behind trailer full of lions part the way 

Ike evacuated to Sugarland,  stayed in friend’s pool house. Was like a party 

Ike stayed at home"
"Well, we had a caravan going to my dad's mother's. 

Car behind us needed water and he had a shit ton, my dad told me to get in the back of the truck and get some bottles for the people around us. 

So I hop out the Truck, jump on the tailgate bumper and bend over for my pants to fall around my knees and I'm not wearing any underwear. 

I45 saw my pastie white ass."
"I was in high school and lived in Spring Branch at the time, left at 5am and took 15 hours to get to San Antonio (like 7 of those were just getting to Katy)- IIRC it took until early-mid afternoon for TXDOT to figure out the contraflow logistics for the freeways. People had their cars in park on I-10, I got out and walked my dog near the beltway. Also, zero phone reception, since everyone was trying to use their phones. My family was in two cars, I would get out and walk to our other car to relay messages. It was wild.

It’s easy to say we shouldn’t have evacuated in retrospect, but here’s the thing a lot of people who weren’t here at the time forget about that hurricane: Rita was like three weeks after Katrina and was a bigger storm, that looked for a time like it was going to directly hit houston. Everyone was on edge with good reason."
This was the largest peace time evacuation in the history of mankind.
"So my story is very different. My brother lived in Shore Acres a coastal neighborhood on Galveston bay. He asked me to come help him get his belongings out of his house. So I did. When we left his house, the nightmare of traffic congestion, and there were roads being blocked by police. We rolled up to a police road block, ""I grew up here and know all of Houston like the back of my hand"" I told the officers that we were headed to my sisters to help get her and her kids ""she has no kids lol"" out. They let us go on through. That little white lie saved us hours if not days of being stuck on the freeway system. We went u to my mothers house in Spring. We had east west access to grocery stores and restaurants, but north south was completely grid locked. It was sweltering hot, cars on 45 were a dead stop. People had exited their vehicles parked in parking lots and were seeking shade under the awnings of businesses. We made sandwiches and cold drinks and went up and handed the out to the people we could get to.. We were limited to only a mile or so north of us, as all north south traffic was at a dead stop and south of us was Spring creek with only the freeway to cross over it. We used back roads and side streets to access as many people as we could.. And then,,,, NOTHING HAPPENED!!! Of course this was all the fault of Rita and the media and the general ignorance of the public. I heard a call on a radio station with people asking what to do if they got flooded out,,,,,,, IN CONROE!! If you dont know the area, Conroe is about 100 miles from Galveston and WAY ABOVE sea level.. I thought what an idiot.. But thats what caused that nightmare. People not having any real understanding of why NO flooded and having no clue of how a hurricane acts when it makes shore. People  IN COASTAL AREAS were told to evacuate. The problem was that people no where near coastal areas evacuated too, for no reason at all. It was a blatant ignorance panic fueled human stampede."
"I worked at a grocery store at the time and it was HORRIBLE. Everyone was such an asshole about the purchase limits for water, etc. After one shift, I ended up telling my boss we evacuated even though we hadn’t because $5.25/hr was not worth it. 

After Rita is when they added the evacuation lanes to the highway and I believe they open up the southbound lanes for northbound traffic."
"It was hell, eight hours and we made it three miles"
Windy
"We lived on the very north side of Houston, I think my dad saw it coming and we left before most everyone, because I remember it only being like 4-7hours to Austin (usually a 2 hour drive) instead of the 20 hours other people had. That and he knew all the back roads so we didn’t even drive on a major highway"
Just stuck on the highway for hours
"Houston and the suburbs were a ghost town. I remember going to Lowes theaters in Stafford and there was no one checking tickets no concessions but all the movies were playing. I saw Wedding Crashers and Lord of War then I drove down 59 S going 140 mph because there wasnt a soul on the road. Of the friends that stayed we partiesld our ass off, one of my fondest memories in high school."
"Had no cell phone reception - the cell networks went bonkers. So had to call family in India who then called my cousins in California who called my cousins in sugar land to see if they had space to pick me up. Left Sugarland with my cousins - I didn’t have a car. We left around midnight and progressed about 200-300 meters in the next 12 hours. Realized we were sitting ducks if the hurricane ever came our way. By then the news reported it was weakening than originally expected, so we turned around and went to a friend’s place and boarded their place up. 

The storm came and took a 90 degree turn towards Lake Charles and we all escaped. But the whole evacuation process by the city was a CLUSTER FUCK. 

That said, the city was prepped by the time Ike came in 2008 - no chaos and smooth evacuations for those who wanted to."
"I had to sequester at work, our building was on Hwy 6 and there’s some angled signs in front.  All day long we watched people pee behind them.  My husband and daughter went to Nacogdoches and left before the traffic got bad.  Everyone else just said screw it and stayed at home."
My mom was getting remarried on lake Livingston and they drove back roads to there from east Houston and it took them about 9 hours. I was fortunately watching it on tv and at her advice I just stayed put in tanglewilde. So I missed my moms second wedding but she said that was ok because I wasn’t there for the first one either lol
"28+ hours to the Dallas area from Galveston. Saw many people dead on the road with sheets over them, broken down cars for days, 3 hour waits for gas and watching fist fights in those parking lots, and terrible gas stations just gouging so much. 

I also remember once I got into the Dallas area how gracious and kind everyone was(weird to say). Everyone thought this was gonna be our big one, and I had more than a few gas stations up north slip a few extra supplies in my bag as I left."
"Left at about 4am; took 18 hours to get from Clear Lake to the Woodlands. Our original destination was Dallas, but it wasn’t feasible. We ended up staying with a friend of a friend in a house with 23 people and 5 dogs."
"It was hell. 9 hours just to get to Austin. Family stayed at a friend's house. Got back a few days later, and the house was totally fine. Wish we all stayed. Harvey was an absolute shit show compared to Rita."
"Be nimble. FEMA types need to make some kind of call ( almost always the wrong call) min 12-24 hrs before landfall. 

They’re using terrible (still best available) info to make their calls. 

Button up your house, fill up the car and spare gas cans if you can safely take them with you and watch the storm like a hawk.

Plan evacuating in @ least 3 different directions. During Rita I did well driving to the coast and the SW along the shore instead of north on I45…. Where everyone was directed to go.

Be sensible, responsible  and use your own head. Don’t be a lemming."
"I was just a kid but I remember being shoved in the back seat of my dad's old pos red chevy pickup. It was so hot and there were blankets all around me. We never moved fast enough to create a breeze inside the cabin and the AC didn't work. Eventually we'd been stuck in the same spot on the interstate for so long that everyone shut off their engines and got out to stretch and get some air. It was such a bizzare experience to see everyone out of the cars on a 3 lane road like that. I remember someone had a camping stove and just started cooking some food for their family while we waited. Eventually we made it to San Antonio after what must have been like 24 hours. Stayed with some people I'd never met, and have still no idea who they were. Watched Cat in the Hat a bunch of times until it was time to go back. The power was out for a couple weeks and we kept the boards up on the windows that whole time. We ate MREs that my grandpa had picked up from FEMA. Our chicken coop had a big branch fall right on it so we had to repair that."
"Got to Austin in about 3.5 hours.  Since everyone was driving North, I drove South to US 90, took that West to 36 North, and took back roads from there to Austin.  Easy sauce."
"Had tickets for ACL festival that weekend in Austin. Decided we likely weren’t going on Thursday but Friday things looked a bit better. We siphoned gas from one car to the smaller more fuel efficient car and set out at 9 pm taking Westheimer as far west as we can to FM362 and then cut north. Took us about two hours to get to 290. When we crossed I10 it was just a solid line of headlights. We hit 290 probably 1am and it was also just jam packed. So we headed back to Houston and got home around 3am. The next morning however i10 cleared and we set out around 11am and made it to Austin by around 3. We enjoyed Saturday and Sunday at ACL festival although it was like 109 degrees. I remember the Arcade Fire on the Funeral tour playing Five Years by Bowie and they were wearing vests and sweaters and I was legit worried for their safety. 

My wife was 8 months pregnant. By Sunday she joined us in Austin because there was no gas little power and no shopping open in Houston. We stayed for about three days extra and headed home."
Anarchy. Law Enforcement was MIA. Preparation and planning was nonexistent.
"14 hours from the Heights to Irving.   By the time we got to FM 1960 we said fuck it, got off the highway and did backroads the majority of the way - using a paper map.  Got to my uncles house and spent a few days lounging by the pool, drinking margaritas and, as it turned out, making a baby.

A few days after we got home we were still trying to locate a great aunt who was evacuated from Beaumont to Alto.  I went and fetched her, drove to Beaumont so she could get some things and as we were going thru Woodville and Lumberton - I have never seen anything like it - hundreds of giant loblolly pines (3-4’ diameter) all snapped off about 10’ up and all pointed toward the coast like the back side of the hurricane got em.  Can you imagine to noise all that made?"
"Evacuation vacation! It was miserable driving for some 20 hours to get from Rosenberg to Love. I was a recent high school graduate, and I was very disheartened with how terribly people acted; when the whole community needed to come together to help everyone, far too many people acted completely selfishly. It was a real wake-up call to me about the nature of people."
"My family and I evacuated. I was pretty young so I don't remember a lot of the details. But we must have left at about 4:00 am three days before it was supposed to hit houston. We were planning on going to Muskogee because that was the closest hotel that had a room available to us. Traffic was at an almost standstill on 45N. We slept in the car when we could. Gas was pretty hard to come by. If you could find a station that had any left, there was a line of 10 cars in front of you waiting to get gas as well. Tempers flared and I saw multiple fights gas, we even had some full gas cans in the back of the SUV chained up, and they got stolen.


After three days we had made it as far as Plano. We got lucky and were able to get a hotel room for one night there. All 12 of us, plus 14 dogs were in this cramped hotel room watching the TV when we saw the news it had changed course and was no longer hitting Katy (where we lived). 


Tempers were hot, days were long, resources were scarce. At the time I felt like I was living a nightmare. Now we look back on it and laugh at all the crazy things we saw (or did). With all that being said, I haven't evacuated for a hurricane since."
"We thought about leaving because my grandma was pretty frail and we weren't sure she could ride out a week without A/C. But we're in a higher area of town, didn't flood during Allison and survived Alicia fine. After hearing about the people stuck on the routes outbound, we were staying put no matter what.

Neighbors ran out of gas on 290 and called us, hoping we could do a rescue. We called some dude my dad worked with who lived in Waller hoping he could get to them. That guy called a cousin who was closer still. Epic game of telephone to get them help. 🤣"
"Lots of traffic.

I admit I got off super easy. I only left because my mother would not chill out even though I was certain I would be fine, since I lived in spring. So I went to their house in LaGrange.

It took me 4 hours, instead of the usual hour and a half to two. But here's what I did:
I bought a road atlas and had printed directions (back in the day before GPS). I knew the freeway was going to be a mess. 
I left at 4:00 a.m. on the Thursday.  Drove out 2920 until I hit 290, then I took 290 to Brenham (not bad about 20 mph but consistently moving). I got off the freeway in Brenham and took country roads the rest of the way into LaGrange. I almost hit cows and drove across a one lane wooden bridge. The slowest part of the trip was crossing highway 6 on 2920, that took at least an hour because people were blocking half of 2920. I was lucky enough to be in the left lane so I was able to get through easily.

My now husband went to his mom's house in The Woodlands from Webster, but he went there two days before the evacuation got crazy.

My now in-laws tried to evacuate their house in Manvel, and after 2 hours not going anywhere, they turned around and went home.


I can say that it was wild in LaGrange too. People went to hand out gas to cars along I10. One of my mom's friends owned an RV park and she had to start asking very specific questions when people called to reserve spaces since one person asked if they accepted animals, and then brought cows."
A day that you realized the layout of this city is a death trap if shit really did hit the fan.
"21 hours for my father and I to reach Waco. 

Along our travels, we witnessed….


1. A BBQ place give us a free onion+pickle+bun sandwich because all other food items had run out. Not even togo boxes, napkins, straws, sodas/bottled water were left. Just veggies and buns lol

2. We got gas 1 time and we were super lucky to get it. Some saint from the heavens stood at the members only gas pump and Sam’s or Kroger (I don’t remember the name of the gas station) and was swiping a member card to either get everyone discounts or to allow us to get gas from the member only pumps.

3. At the same gas station^ there was a man who tried to fill up 10 red containers of gas but was held up at gunpoint after he filled up his 6th or 7th one and robbed of 4 red containers of gas by 2 men in broad daylight in front of hundreds of people in line. Not one person got out to assist lol. We are all waiting for gas and he’s filling up his truck and 10 containers. Selfish. 

4. Some cars over heated or broke down and so the owners pushed the cars under a overpass or on the grass in the median and set up a tent using the roof and doors and blankets to ride out the storm (which never came thankfully).

5. An Ambulance ran out of fuel and the patient died. Our relative was the patient. 

6. What “contra flow” meant and how it can be created on (out of?) roads that were not meant for it. 


Overall, it was a life changing experience. Largest mass migration of humans at once in the USA (at the time) all for a storm that never hit. To this day, I know people who have refused to leave for anything because of the Rita evacuation."
"From Cypress, it took us 3 hours to reach Brenham. Parents, 3 kids under 10, 2 dogs, and a cat. Took around 10 hours total to reach Austin- we ran out of gas once in the gridlock and I nearly fainted from the heat, but there was a wonderful samaritan nearby who had the foresight to bring several tanks. I know I was lucky- many people died that day. I remember seeing people peeing and pooping on the sides of the roads, and an ambulance unable to pass."
"Insanity, I was 15 at the time and my parents saw a cat 5 headed for us after what they just saw happened to NOLA and freaked out. Drove with my mom and little brother 100mph the wrong way in the 45 contraflow north of Conroe and every time traffic backed up on one side would drive across the median to the other. My dad worked near 610 and Airline at the time and it took him over 9 hours to drive to our home in Spring that evening."
"Took us 10 hours to get to cleavland. After that, we were done with trying freeways, so we got off and cut through backroads. It took us 24 hrs to get to Dallas. Thankfully some of the small towns off the freeway still had gas"
My mom and I drove to Plano with our dogs. Took both cars. We got up early and it was still hectic and chaotic.
About 24hrs to get to Austin. Left around 7 or 8 and got to Austin 7am the next day.
"My family left the West Houston area (think Barker Cypress and I-10 / Cullen Park / Addicks Dam) the early morning before Rita was supposed to make landfall. 

The pressure in the air was eerie. Everything was telling me to leave. My animal pals wanted to leave. There air outside was incredibly silent and still. No bugs nor frogs nor birds sang. Just stillness. 

My parents did not want to evacuate, but I bargained with them. I personally brought in all of the patio furniture. I taped up the large windows. *And I mapped out backroads for us to evacuate to San Antonio.* Our one and only stop was in Shiner to let our 2 dogs relieve themselves. We got to rural San Antonio just in time for breakfast. 

Somehow, the only damage my house sustained was my washing machine broke. I still don’t understand how that happened. 

My boyfriend’s (now husband’s) mom evacuated from a flood prone area in Pasadena. She got stuck on a freeway. Her car died on the latter part of the first day."
I drove from Montrose to Spring (steubner airline/louetta) and it took me about 5 hours
"We left much earlier than most people, and it still took us almost 8 hours to get to the Huntsville area, taking back roads to bypass 45 as much as we could. 

And I was stuck with my mildly insane mother-in-law and no antidepressants.

Rita, that bitch, wound up doing more damage up that way than she did back at our house south of Houston. Once we figured this was happening, we said, ""Fuck all THIS"", left, and went home. 

It was a fucking nightmare that I never want to experience again."
I live in the city of So Houston and the law was driving around with a speaker bellering MANDATORY EVACUATION. We started towards the Valley and it took us 2 hours to get to Rosenberg. It was hot and muggy and cars on the highway were overheating because they sat for so long without moving. Many travelers were in vehicles with no air conditioning and they were suffering. I saw a flatbed trailer with a goat in a cage along with chickens and dogs in cages sitting in that stifling heat. I decided that we could not continue and went back to South Houston. I didn’t care WHO said it was a mandatory evacuation. I was not leaving and we all know the outcome of the storm.
We left Friendswood at like 10 that morning.   We reached a hotel in Dallas that would accept our dog at like 2AM.  We left at 8 am to finish our trip to Kansas.   Listening to the radio it took 4 more hours to get to Dallas for every hour later people left.
As close to SHTF day as I can imagine. The heat didn’t help either. Katrina scared the shit out of all of us.
"I remember walking down I45 passing out water with my sister, was surreal. Any time I hear the Faint I am reminded."
Drove for 20 hours and decided to turn around and drove 25 minutes
"We were in a mandatory evacuation zone. 

I was 9 months pregnant and thought I would have my daughter on the side of the road. 

We took back roads from Conroe to Huntsville, but had to get on I-45 for a couple miles and that took several hours. 

We ended up going to Arkansas, out of necessity, because all of the hotels in Texas were full with Katrina evacuees. 

Overall, we were lucky.  But it was a super scary time."
"I did that. 14 hours to get to San Antonio, which is usually 3.

Ppl had run outta gas and were stranded in the side of the road. I saw old ppl just laying down on the grass by the interstate as we drove past at 5 mph.

I saw a sign that said ""need water for baby formula,"" ppl that looked like they were passed out on the grass. More people seemed stopped than moving. 

I had a 1 yr old in a car seat. We couldn't run the AC because there was no gas. The news told us babies overheat easier so we were fanning her the whole time. 

I pulled into a gas station 1 mile from my mom's house at exactly 0.0 miles left in my tank."
I live in Conroe. The freeway was a sea of parked cars.  My boyfriend and I went to hand out water along the road.
"Oof.  Twelve hour drive to Austin with two dogs, one who kept getting car sick.  Stressing over finding a gallon or two of gas at a time to keep going.  Such a long day."
I convinced my family to head south to Corpus Christi. It barely took any extra time and we stayed there for a week. Came back and the only damage was the roof had been torn off our barn (assuming a tornado came through at some point as the house was fine). My best friend’s family ended up stuck on 288 for 24 hours and barely got anywhere. They ended up just going home.
"My mom and brother live in Galveston County. I moved to Oregon, but I heard all about it. My brother and his grown kids kinda drove as a caravan, with my mom included. They were on the road for over 6 hours and never made it past 610 south. My brother said people were falling asleep at the wheel. Occasionally, someone might bump the person in front of them accidently. He saw someone pull out a gun, more than once. Lots of people got out of their cars to pee or poop on the side of the road. He said it was awful.  My mom said she will never leave again, even if it's a cat 5."
"My dad was coming back from a work trip in Atlanta. He said on his way INTO town from IAH, he was one of maybe ten people on the road into town and everyone else was on the way out. He said it looked like a scene from an apocalypse movie."
I am so thankful my parents turned the car around 30 min in. What a huge waste of time and gas for so many people
"I lucked out sorta.  l knew someone who had gotten stuck trying to leave New Orleans a year before so understood probably better than most what a nightmare the roads could become. I convinced my husband at the time to leave work in Sugarland early so he got home before everyone got on the road. 

Myself was a teacher and had to go from Little York Road to my house at the time off of FM 1488 and 2978. Packed up the classroom hamsters and was gone by 3:15, my coworkers thought I was crazy. 45 N was empty until I hit south of The Woodlands and traffic just stopped so I got off at Woodlands Parkway to cut over to 2978…basically any road headed E-W was fine and any road headed northbound was stopped. 

Took me an hour to go the 2 miles on 2978 to get to my house, literally thought about stopping and walking the rest but since traffic was still creeping forward I eventually made it. Few hours later the stories of cars being abandoned, gas stations being over ran and people stranded on the road started pouring in….realized I missed being one of those folks by an hour or so."
"12 hours from Clear Lake to Cleveland Tx.  I got out and walked some while traffic was not moving.  We started with a full tank of gas and ended up with half a tank.  

When we stopped in Cleveland, there was a sense of lawlessness.   

We then boarded FEMA buses to take us to Austin.  We started out with a police escort but they bailed as soon as we got outside the city limits.  

That bus ride was something out of a dystopian movie."
"I was 15 years old. The adults were freaking out. All the moms were packing food in coolers and calling pharmacies and all of the dads on the block had maps spread out across the hoods of their trucks trying to get us all out of the city in one convoy.  I remember taking a walk the afternoon before we evacuated. I couldn’t take the noise of the adults anymore so I went out and just started walking. It was so quiet. I can still remember the trees rustling. I was nervous because I didn’t see a single animal in sight. Not a bird, not a stray dog. Not even a squirrel. Empty streets of nothing. Everyone was already gone, we were some of the last to leave. A family who stayed behind died when they accidentally put the generator in the house. I don’t think they knew any better. They just didn’t have the means to leave. It was a surreal time to be alive."
Had family off 1960 (house prone to flooding) and in the woodlands(not prone to flooding) at that time. As the youngin with a car I got to transport people and stuff a lot. Each round trip would take almost 8 hrs up kuykendahl and back.
Must have left at the worst possible time. I remember it took close to 24 hours to get from Friendswood to North Houston. Horrible traffic was around when the bus of nursing home patients caught fire and killed a bunch of people on I 45
"I didn't have to evacuate. I was working in the woodlands at a vet clinic / dog kennel on the freeway. There were so many people stranded on the freeway in front of our clinic. I can't remember the numbers but I remember being horrified by how.many people dropped their pets off, paid the deposit and never returned to pick them back up.
 
My normal 20 minute drive home from work took nearly 5 hours on the back roads and I almost ran out of gas because you couldn't find any."
"I was a young kid and we evacuated to a family members ranch. Was horrible and we got stuck for hours. my sibs and I ended up watching the simpsons over and over on one of those dvd players they used to put in cars. 

My grandpa died in the evacuation but he was not traveling with us. We have never evacuated since then"
we were leaving from the memorial / alief area and it took us about 6 hours to get to Katy. the most impactful memories I have are 1. a guy busted out a grill on the side of the road and was throwing down some burgers and hotdogs and 2. every single gas station was completely sold out of gas
Don't eat milk and grapes before evacuating.
It was trash. Took me 14 hours to get to Austin. My uncle from Galveston got stuck on the road for hours and that caused some kind of clotting in his leg from sitting so long and he died from the complications. I’ll never evacuate again. I’ll go on my roof and sit in the rain before I drive during all that mess.
"An old lady died on a shuttle in traffic behind us, they stopped at a small town and an ambulance took her away. Churches were giving out food and water to anyone who stopped. The road was so hot my shoes stuck to the asphalt. It was an honestly terrible time"
"Went from Sugar Land to Waco. We left like at 4 in the morning and got stuck on 99 when it was just a feeder road and a couple lanes. We were stuck in the same quarter mile for like 6 hours. I don’t remember how long it took us to get there or when we started moving but it was all so pointless in the end. 

I was like 13 at the time."
Looks like a normal day in LA :/
Took 8-9 hours to get to Austin from Spring. We got lucky that Rita made that last-minute turn. Rita was a firebreather with 160+ knot sustained wind.
I stayed home.
"We ended up on some back roads with my dad getting steadily angrier. A woman tried pulling in front of us and my pops wasn't having it and she almost ran us off the road. My dad pulled a cased shotgun across his lap and looked and nodded at the woman. She drove into the dirt and sped ahead. We moved about ten more feet and were then swarmed by police. An officer popped open my door and told me if I moved he'd drop me like a bad habit, (I was 15)."
I was just a kid but my dad took back roads with a map he printed out on Mapquest somehow and we made it to Kingwood in about 4 hours. They made the decision to ride out the storm back in Galveston County after the storm shifted. We drove back home with the freeways being completely empty. It was one of the eeriest things I've ever seen.
Wild to think more people died trying to leave than the hurricane itself
Lesson - the danger posed by weather is inversely proportional to the warnings on tv.
"Never to take a route through Houston. When Ike came, we drove straight west until we reached the Hill Country. Also, backroads are your friend."
"My chihuahua dog and I went to a friends house in New Braunfels from the Clear Lake area leaving the afternoon before, normally a 3 hour trip, took me 12.  I was on my flip phone with my friend while he was looking at mapquest and guiding me to use back roads where possible, instead of using i-10. Those back roads were still at a standstill. After moving 11 inches in an hour I decided to drive in the opposite lane of the 2 lane road which had not a single car going in any direction, and did so for as long as I could and it shaved off days of driving. Got to my friends took a nap, went out and stayed well after people returned to avoid the rush back. I did have to pee in a bottle and I dropped it and urine got on my person."
"The road was so hot that the tar was seeping up from the asphalt. If you got out, your shoes got it all over."
"At the request of my wife’s family, we agreed to evacuate from NE Houston to go stay with family in Lufkin( normally 2.5 hour drive tops). 

My, wife, two dogs and I loaded in my MILs Toyota Camry and started our journey. 26 hours later after a fender bender, at least two panic attacks, a 1 hour nap and bologna sandwich at a church refuge in the middle of the night, we arrived in Lufkin. Not long after we arrived we found out that the hurricane had changed course and was headed directly towards us. Luckily we were far enough inland that we didn’t get hot too hard. But, we did lose power for a couple days. 

To top it off, when we got home, we saw that the microwave time was still set, indicating the power never even went out at home. 

NEVER AGAIN!!!"
It took ~16 hours to get from the Beaumont area to my family's home in San Antonio.. fun times
3 hours from Sugar Land to Cinco Ranch. 2 digs and 3 cats and 4 people. One cat decided she needed to ride on my shoulder using her claws to balance. Said cat the took a shit on one of the other cats. That's when we said f this turned around in the median and was home in 30 minutes.  It was not my idea to evacuate. The husband insisted. I'd been through Alicia in 82 and knew we were 60 miles inland. Never felt so good as being right.
I was in it for about an hour and gave up. I went back home.
"We evacuated from a small town just outside Beaumont, about 20 minutes from High Island. There were 4 vehicles in our ""wagon train"" loaded with everything we could take. I was in my 98 Honda Civic, no AC, windows down for ~19 hours. It had a manual transmission. By the time we arrived at our destination, my clutch leg was cramping and when I blew my nose it was completely full of black soot from all the vehicles exhaust. The roads were lined with cars that had broken down or run out of gas. People were begging for food and water. It was pretty apocalyptic."
"I still have ptsd from that day.  Was planning to head North but made it to IAH and just left my car there and took a flight out.  After seeing what had happened with Katrina, no way I was staying in Houston."
20 hrs to San Antonio non stop
"We went to Waco/Rosebud from Houston. I was in the 9th or 10th grade. A 4 hr drive horrifically transformed into a 12 hr gridlocked clusterf***. Came home afterwards, house was fine. Everyone was afraid from Hurricane Katrina."
"I was in college 2 hrs away in East Texas, so I watched it on TV."
"It was insane…my family headed out earlier, got caught in traffic a few miles out of town. Nobody was moving. Someone’s dog died from overheating bc people were running out of gas to keep their cars on.

My mom called me and just told me to stay put, I ended up hanging with a buddy from my neighborhood, got some beer, decided we wanted smoke, so drove up ONE exit to my buddies house on the feeder…and it took like 2-3 hours to get up there…it was terrible. Annnnnd then Rita didn’t hit…"
"It was a 5 hour trip on the Hardy from downtown to Lake Conroe. Peed in a gatorade bottle. Probably could have just gotten out of the car, gone on the side of the road and gotten back in without missing a beat."
19 hours and made it 75 miles before we turned around and came home when we learned the storm shifted
"Took me 13 hrs. to get to Sealy from BW8 & I10. It was crazy.  Just bought my first manual car 2 days before. My clutch leg was tired.  Had plenty of snacks and water. It was hot & humid. I remember seeing a toddler walking around in just a diaper. There were some people who brought out their webber grill and were cooking food for people around.  Decided I was going to run out of gas if I stayed on my course so, left I10 and took back roads to Montgomery.  Took me 45 min."
Just like that picture (for people that don't know about back roads)
"I was a kid in my mom’s beat-to-hell Saturn and I was hoping we would just ride it out. We spent all day in traffic crammed in. We got to the place we were going to evacuate to and got told to fuck off by the police because they said it would be bad there too (near jasper, tx. I didn’t live in Houston then)   We ended up being taken in by strangers somewhere north of there, can’t remember. But spent even longer in traffic.


But ended up being a great thing we did leave after police told us because a really big tree fell and destroyed the place we were going to stay. Would have killed my grandparents probably"
"I was living in Conroe and working in Willis. Company at the time sent me all around town to pickup every single cell phone battery I could. Ended up having to sneak along back roads just to get back to the office. 

Still remember driving home on the feeder road laughing."
Took us 22 hours to get from Clear Lake to Austin. 290 in Waller County was brutal.
Me too
"I drove from Spring Branch to my parents place outside Conroe. Normally 45 minutes but took me 8 hours.

I remember being behind an 18 wheeler and an SUV with some sticker in the back window. Because traffic was insane, I figured it wouldn't hurt to pick up new music. So because it was 2005, I pulled off 59 and into the Best Buy in Humble to buy some CDs. When I left there and finally got back on the freeway I was literally behind that same truck and SUV"
Took us about 15 hours to get to ft worth from the woodlands. Came home just for a 3” diameter tree to be tipped over. So then we stayed in town during Ike and lost power for about 10 days
"I lived in Spring, so there was no need to evacuate, but we needed to get something from Lowe’s, on the other side of 45 from us. We ended up having to make do with what we had because the backup at the freeways were so bad that, while you could get to the west side of 45 (since the highway was south bound on that side), there was no getting back across because of the backup to get to the north bound lanes."
"Took us close to 40 hours to reach Dallas. We got so lucky to get gas at a gas station, people were crazy for gas, people fought for gas. Was pretty scary. Next hurricane, forgot the name of it(not Harvey), said fuck that, never again."
"I was in high school. We left on the Wednesday evening after school. One of the last groups to get out. We were able to find gas without much of a line at Sam’s Club. Packed the parents, three kids and two cats into a sage-colored Toyota Sienna and drove toward San Angelo, TX.

Earlier that night, my dad showed me a map and told me to pick any city away from the coast. I picked this lovely small town I had never heard of for a safe, weekend retreat. 

We drove single-digit mph for a while, but after passing through San Antonio, the roads were much clearer. Our hotel was next to a beautiful stream/river bank, and it was a dry heat that felt lovely compared to the bayou. We walked around the antique stores and saw advertisements for the local sheep run the next day.

Watched the news in the hotel breakfast area that the hurricane had avoided Houston, so we made our way home pretty quickly after that."
It took us 14hrs to get to San Antonio.
Luckily I was working out of town and was in College Station so just stayed put there in a hotel. As an example of the madness the gas stations in College Stations were out of gas like the day before already.
"I was stuck in traffic driving to Lubbock for over 24 hours. It normally takes 8, and the only reason it didn't take even longer is because we used a road atlas in the back of the car to take some more obscure back roads. I'm beyond thankful we didn't run out of gas, but we rode without air conditioning for as long as we could to try to save every last drop. 

It was miserable. People died, and if Rita would have actually hit, *so many* would have drowned."
"Controlled chaos. People were wild, we saw one guy hitting a car with a cane, heard a couple of stories of individuals pulling out knives over spots at gas stations, saw gas station bathroom conditions I can never unsee. We evacuated from the Galveston County area and traveled up to Dallas with my family. We left at night and traveled up 45, we were still in Houston by morning. We managed to find gas at a station a distance from the freeway and we had to wait in line (station only had premium left). We also stopped to nap since we spent all night inching up the freeway. Once we got to the point where the south bound lanes were open for driving north we moved faster. I was to switch between north and south bounds sides when there were slow downs. My brother and I were traveling separate from my parents and we were separated for most of the day. It was damn near impossible to make a call with a cell phone but texts were still working, and this led to my parents finally learning to text the old school way. We got to Dallas that night, took us over 24 hours to get somewhere that normally took 5.

We had extended family that we met up with and their trip was similar. A couple of them turned back around way early, and the others got stuck on the opened HOV lane iirc but made it to Dallas the morning after we did. They almost had to abandon a vehicle but found gas, and their beloved 15+ year old dog passed away during the trip :( 

When we got home, there was little to no damage to our house."
"I forgot what hurricane I evacuated, but we waited the day the hurricane hit. i10 had hundreds of cars on the side of the road that presumably ran out of fuel. It felt like those zombie apocalypse movies where you’re just driving past all the stalled cars. That experience and driving the day after Harvey hit and also during covid are becoming too common"
I only evacuated from Kingwood to River Plantation. Got there in less than 30 minutes taking back roads; Sorters Rd. to FM 1314. No one was using it so I was FLYING about 100mph the whole way. Drove over 59 looking like this though.
"Let's see.  12 hours to get out to Conroe from med center, 10 of those hours just sitting on 45 in the Woodlands.  No AC, hot as hell, stressing about finding gas. My dog looking like she was gonna die from hear exhaustion."
It took me 12 hours to make a drive that would typically take me 90 minutes.  Pretty insane.
"We had a hurricane party at a friends house, when all our “party supplies” ran out we headed the opposite direction of traffic to get more and laughed at all the losers in traffic"
"Didn’t leave, helped my dad board up some windows (waste of time), swam in my neighbors pool because they evacuated, then went to a Rita’s for Rita party and got hammered."
"We evacuated at three in the morning because my dad thought there wouldn't be as many people on the road in the middle of the night, but NOPE. We were headed to my sister's place in Denton, and what's normally a 4.5 hours trip took about 12 hours. All in all it could have gone worse. We didn't run out of gas and had the dog with us and the dog was great despite being stuck in the car for so long. I remember we were flabbergasted that they still hadn't closed down the southbound lanes for contraflow. I honestly don't remember if they ever even did that at any point. It was a total shitshow.  

Meanwhile our neighbors waited until the day the storm was gonna hit before they left for San Antonio, and it was smooth sailing for them. 

My parents stayed behind for Ike after that experience and ironically the house actually took some damage in that one."
"It was a younger time… we loaded up 4 cars worth of friends with no plan, but we did all have Nextel radio phones… took us 19 hours to get from Orange to Austin. No gas, no food in the gas stations, many more hours spent in park than in drive. Did most of the drugs we had on the way, to arrive at a friends cousin house that grew her own weed. Sat wasted and stoned glued to the weather channel it showed us in real time our city getting whacked."
I was on this bridge with my dad watching the traffic.. grew up in Oak Ridge..we had the silver suv near the middle. It was kinda a party up there.. my buddy rolled up and made margaritas in the bed of his truck
21 hours to get to Austin. Normally a 3 hour drive. Had 5 seniors over 70 with us in our caravan.
Really bad
It was driving 11 hrs to get to Austin. With no gas.
It took me 12 hours to get where I needed instead of the regular thirty minutes.
"I was 16. I was late getting out of town because a friend needed a ride home from school. Her carpool left without her when school shut down early. My parents hadn’t finished their work day yet but told me to start driving to Austin to stay with my older brother. Soooo yeah, did that drive in that traffic alone as a 16 year old. It took 7 hours to get to Austin I think?"
"I was at work down in Mo City, came out the door, looked at Hwy 6 stacked up, said Nope, took the cross streets home and stayed put. It was weird having this huge city all to myself like some zombie apocalypse.

Right after Ike I was working off I10, the streets were largely deserted yet some old lady managed to drive her car into the side of our building. Houston's finest were out directing traffic at intersections without power but the sheriff's boys somehow didn't have anything to do. I counted 17 deputy vehicles in our parking lot attending to this old lady."
"I was stuck on 290 in a two door Cavalier with my sister, her boyfriend, my cat and 90% of my stuff for like 36 hours. We moved 2 miles in 2 hours. Eventually we walked to a WalMart, found an unopened gallon of water, drank it and pissed behind the dumpster.

[edit] I was living next to NASA at the time."
We planned on staying but some people came through the neighborhood on loudspeaker and said it was an evacuation zone. We piled in to my mom’s suburban and took some weird ass alternative route to south Texas with some family. It took an extra 3-4 hours to make the drive but it wasn’t terrible compared to a lot of people that just got stuck on the roads.
"Litty, I remember playing snake on my Nokia sitting in my cousin ss Monte Carlo for hours, traffic was so backed up we sat on the trunk sometimes and jumped out and switch cars. Made it to Huntsville and these nice ass people who ran a bed and breakfast let us stay the night for free. Eventually ended up in a gym with sleeping bags at some church…simpler times man"
"I was a kid and my family left relatively early, made it to Dallas in about 18 hours. 

Most distinctive thing I remember was 94.5 playing nothing but requests on the radio. Heard some weird songs like Three Little Pigs by Green Jelly, but the most played song was Wake Me Up When September Ends by Green Day and I remember crying to that a lot. That song is forever tied to Rita for me."
Took my mother 21 hours to go from Leauge City to the Woodlands where I lived.
I live close to the coast and really need to evacuate in these situation. I remember being parked for 18 hours getting more and more pissed at people on the north side bugging out and creating the mess and then getting worried about getting stuck on the freeway when the weather came. So terrified mixed with angry.
Busy
Important to remember that it was the largest urban evacuation in human history. Crazy stuff.
"Horrible, I was leaving from Lake Jackson gulf coast area during that time. Took us 22 hours to get to college Station for a drive that is usually 2 and half hours. Forever grateful for A&M University for opening its doors to hurricane evacuations that year. 

During the drive we did try to get breakfast from jack in the box and the poor employee was trying to close the doors as the inside was already about 40 people deep. She just started throwing cups at everyone saying to take a drink and leave that business was closed."
"It wasn’t fun. We were new to Texas and had just seen what NO went through with Katrina a few weeks before. It took my wife, two kids (2 & 5), two dogs and two cats 16 hours to get to the first hotel we could find with an available room somewhere up near Dallas. A guy offered me $100 for five gallons of gas we were traveling with and when I told him it was not for sale he tried to steal it.  We haven’t tried to evacuate for any other storms since."
"We went to Mexico which was about a 6 hr drive and it took about twice that. After that and seeing Rita didn’t do anything we never evacuated again. Luckily for us, my parents house is raised so it’s never flooded"
"I was a kid at the time so I was chilling in the back seat with a gameboy and a fresh pack of batteries. Took about 10 hours to get from southwest houston to cypress. Not sure how far we were planning on going, but my dad’s friend who lives there wait to just stay with them.

Oh and I remember my uncle being like an hour or two behind just had his Rottweiler in the back without shade or water. When she died he just left her on the freeway. Dude’s a little different."
"I was a kid. We drove for 27 hrs from pearland, made it to the woodlands and my dad turned around and got home in 30 min when we realized gas was low and we weren’t going to make it to Dallas. The storm was uneventful"
"We stayed in and will always remember the call of ""oh hey it turned east right before landing"", RIP Beaumont and the people on  i10."
"We were going to stay with family outside Brenham. Took us 8 hours to get halfway there.

Turned around and were home in \~45 minutes."
"It fucking sucked. After 3 hours I was only in North Houston and going delirious it was my reality. Me and the cat took a nap then made it to family in OK after 24 hours. This is why I didn’t evacuate in Harvey, that traffic experience was horrible."
"Bruh took us 36hours to get from Alief To Tyler Texas, I never ever ever ever want to go through that again"
18 hours idling to Austin. Was a nightmare and so many people got stranded and ran out of gas. My father fell asleep at the wheel and bumped the car in front of us. That didn’t help with morale. And we ran out of water and had to feed our cat LaCroix. That was funny.
My friend drove from clear lake to Livingston and it took 13 hours lol
"I stayed in my apartment off 290 in Jersey Village and waited it out. We went “truck surfing” on a very empty 1960 to get gas before it was all gone. 

I would look out at 290 from my apartment complex to see how far the traffic had moved, and it effectively didn’t for 15-20 hours maybe? It felt like a whole day and then some."
"I worked at a car audio shop in Huntsville, 1st exit open on 45 and thry had both sides foing north. Was a wild time, gave out a bunch of free water and phone chargers... and then someone drove a truck through the shop at like 2am and stole all the JL equipment."
We didn’t leave because we were pretty sure evac was going to be a disaster. Boarded up and rode it out. We lived over by Hobby Airport and the water stopped rising 5ft from the front door. It was the right call but we had our doubts … until we heard about the snarls on the highway. We were fortunate.
I was so glad I rode this storm out lol
"11 hours to get from Meyerland to the Woodlands.  Parents wanted my sister and I to stay with my dad at their house.  My mom was a paramedic, so she had to be stay at her station."
"Well we lived in sugar land and took the country roads to Dallas but it was still slow moving, took us 13 hours. I found myself pissing in bushes on the side of the two lane roads we’d be on so a lot of people took pictures of me haha. My brother in law had access to private gas stations used for oil tanker trucks. So we never ran out"
"It was crazy. We left a day before the storm hit, it took my family 14 or more hours to get to Waco from League City. There were cars abandoned on the side of the road because people ran out of gas, people were outside their cars talking and walking around."
"Oh god that was terrible. That was the day I learned ""evacuate early or not at all"". 

I spent 14 hours in the car in one stretch going what felt like .5 miles per hour. Eventually made it through and made it all the way to Tuscaloosa since I figured if I'm evacuating I may as well evacuate to a good football game.

I got to see Darren McFadden and Felix Jones play so it wasn't all bad."
Took 11 hours to make it as far as Columbus when my dad said fuck it and turned around and drove 45 minutes back home. Gas stations were out of fuel and we didn’t pack enough food to drive that long so I guess he figures he’d rather gamble staying over running out of gas and being hungry on the side of the highway for the next day or two
We don't talk about that day.
Mass evacuations just can’t work
Does anybody remember that Michael Douglas movie ‘Falling Down’?
"Eh, just stayed home"
"I left work at 2pm that day, I didn't make it home till after midnight.   Greenspoint to The Woodlands."
Very very very boring. It took us 8 hours to go what normally takes about an hour. It was awful.
I was sleeping in the car. Parents told me they took 2 hours to travel only a few miles before they gave up and went back home.
I was blessed with a father who has a 6th sense for storms. We evacuated two days before Rita to Mexico and avoided being without power for god knows how long. Same thing with Harvey. I was like 24 and my dad told me to call into work for the rest of the week on Wednesday. We took the cars to get an oil change and headed to Mexico that night. Storm hits on sat/sun? And my best friend was texting me that the water was up to their knees at their house and they ended up on their roof trying to get rescued. Luckily nothing happened to our house but Houston was a very ugly place for weeks after Harvey so we stayed put until Harris County made me come back to work lol
"I remember being on the road for about twenty hours just to get to Dallas from southeast Texas. Also when the radio station started playing Rock You Like a Hurricane, I fucking Lost it and laughed during the whole song."
"I got laid, it was a pretty sweet day."
Unfathomably awful. It's a miracle that we somehow managed to make it to Austin in 16 hours.
Completely sucked
22 hours to get to Waco. It was a very terrible experience.
How much rain did Rita bring into Houston? It didn’t seem like much.
"We tried to head East. It took us 15 hours to get to Winnie, turn around and came home  now if we ever need to leave again we will leave days out."
Took us 14-16 hours to get to college station. What a waste of a day
"For one - totally unnecessary for us, but me & son took the 2 cats to Hillsboro where SO was working. Drove all night up Hwy 36 to Hwy 6 thru Waco. There was a stretch thru Rosenberg where the stop lights held up traffic for over an hour. There was no cross traffic and the local PD did not take over to get traffic flowing. Got home a few days later and one branch from one tree was on the road. No other damage on our block. No flooding either."
"Day? You mean days? Plural, not singular."
I was leaving with my dog and daughter head to San Antonio took 1.5 hours to drive in other times 15 minutes I was afraid of running out of gas turned around back home in 15 minutes didn’t even get a drop of rain had to water my outside plants the next day
We left and we were stuck in traffic for two days straights. Good thing is that we had three drivers in the car and we stopped in San Antonio and chilled out with some family.
"I wasn't evacuating, I had planned a road trip (going via Ft. Worth) departure for that date about a month beforehand, and stupidly thought I could beat the traffic if I left at 3am.  I honestly did not expect the mass evac that happened.  My friend and I sat in traffic for 8 hours to only make it as far as the woodlands.  I remember leaving my car to walk off the freeway and pee in the woods, came back to my car which hadn't moved an inch.

At one point we found a gas station that didn't have terrible lines, there was an unattended moto at the pump and then I would be next in line.  I looked for anyone in the register line wearing a shred of leather, found the motos owner, told him I would pay for his gas at the pump.  This was the only station we had seen all day that had not run out of gas, and I was worried it would run dry while I was waiting for that guy to pre-pay for fuel.  So we successfully got gas and back on the road.

We gave up around the woodlands.  My friend's parents had friends who lived up there but were out of town, and I guess they told us where the key was hidden because we stayed the night at their house.  The next morning I pulled out a paper map that I kept in my glove box and marked off some tentative routes that could get us to Ft. Worth without hitting the interstates (we were going much farther than that, but I knew traffic wouldn't be an issue after DFW area).  I called the sherrifs dept in each county we would be passing through to verify that the roads in question were open.  We made it out the next day with no hiccups, by sticking to surface roads.

Funny enough, it was that situation that opened my eyes to the fact that if there ever is a disaster affecting a mass area, *you aren't going anywhere.*  I subsequently moved to Chicago, where the avenues out of the city are even fewer (the lake blocks the entire East side of the city).  I had a decent emergency stash to ride out various emergencies that may arise, which meant I was sitting pretty on a pile of N95 masks when Covid hit."
"Lousy. It took us about 8 hours to get from the Heights area to where 290 and Highway 6 meet in Hempstead. That's where we turned on Highway 6 to head to College Station where we stayed with family until the storm passed. My wife was about 34 weeks pregnant, and we drove (on the rare occasions traffic moved) with the windows down and A/C off to conserve gas, just in case. There was another 3 hours or so of driving on Highway 6 to get from Hempstead to College Station, so 11 or so hours in the car, total.

This is TMI, but I put a 5 gallon bucket in the Suburban before we left. My wife kinda made fun of me, until we hit 3-4 hours of sitting on 290, she really needed to pee, and there was no bathroom in sight. Yay 5 gallon bucket.

0/10, do not recommend."
I was 15 years old and my grandfather lived in Galveston. I had to helped him bored up his house and then evacuate. Took us 30 hours to get to Austin to my uncles house. Absolutely miserable.
13 hours to get from 45 s/Edgebrook to Katy
"From east Houston to Livingston took us 16 hours, we got bounced around by an 18 wheeler driver who was tired, no damage thankfully, at night saw a car slam another car into an 18 wheeler and the driver come out and stuff the 24pack of beer box in the trunk, ended up in school shelter to ride out the storm, left first thing in the morning and made it back home in 50 mins, one of the first people in our neighborhood to be able to come back, saw a lot of cars abandoned all along i10 I was 10 at the time, so it was a pretty crazy thing to still remember"
Took my wife 14 hours to get from League City to Kingwood. I had a critical position at a natural gas pipeline company in the galleria area. Took me an hour to get there at 2 AM since I knew back streets. My wife was still stuck in traffic while I was heading to work.  I left there around 9 AM and using back roads made it to Kingwood in about an hour. She was ready to choke me when I said traffic wasn’t so bad. Lol
"It was miserable being stuck on I-45, I was only like 9 years old at the time but I’ll never forget thinking that it was chaotic. Cars being abandoned, people using the restroom out of their vehicles, and the scorching heat. After being in the vehicle with my family after so many hours, we only got to near Huntsville and couldn’t find any gas station without bags on the pumps. Now as an adult, I wish that I could say that I’d never evacuate for a hurricane but a tree ended up falling on top of our house so probably good that we left lol"
"Oof, reading this thread is bringing back so many memories of that day. We have family from New Orleans that evacuated for Katrina to Houston, and we were intimately aware of the situation there, so we tried to evacuate.

My mom is a public school teacher, and her district didn't let out until the day before Rita made landfall. Our neighbors left at like 5am, but we didn't leave until about 8-9am. No AC to conserve gas. We did stop once in the afternoon, just because we stumbled across one gas station that still had gas, and figured we should fill up again just in case we weren't able to fill up again. People were just standing on the side of the road, pissing, taking their dogs out, talking, abandoning cars. Our dog freaked out and crammed himself under the passenger side seat, and we couldn't get him to come out. 

Then our neighbors called us. We asked them how far they'd gotten, since they left about 3-4 hours before us. They said they were back home 😂 they hadn't gotten much further than us, before they gave up. So we decided to just go home and ride it out together. 

We were on 249 North for 8 hours, then turned around and got home in 15 min."
"Flew back in from North Carolina to Houston from a work event and saw the entire city of Houston lit up red from brake lights from the sky. Will never forget that, it was wild. We were late to the evac game since I had been out of town. So, by the time I got back and we packed up l, we were already screwed. We only left because we thought our crappy little area would be a war zone if shit went south and looting broke out. Woke up early the next morning, tried to pull money from 6 different ATMs with no luck and left 1960/45 area and headed west. Slept on the side of 1-10 with my the boyfriend, dog, 6 guitars, a full cab and other “essentials” in a 2001 Honda civic hatchback for a few hours. We tried every back road we could think of, and inevitably were routed right back to the I-10 contraflow hell. Spent 4 hours at a gas station somewhere outside Sealy waiting for gas. Had to drive another hour past San Antonio to find a hotel. Slept in a Walmart parking lot until the room was available. That was a total of about 32-36 hours. It’s also fuzzy because I had strep and an upper respiratory infection and was so doped up on OTC meds and struggled to stay awake. We ended up staying in that hotel for 4 days waiting for the traffic back INTO Houston to be manageable. 

I vowed then I would never leave again, and stuck with it until I left the area a few years ago for good. Stuck through all the others, including Ike (that was a rough week) and Harvey (lived in Montrose for that one)."
Had some friends who evacuated together as acquaintances. They’re now married.
Made it to my friend's brother's place I'm Dallas in 8 or 9 hours. We went the back way via College Station. Our friends who tried 45 made it 2 or 3 miles in those 8 hours. They turned around.
"It took my brother and I about 13 hours to get to Mexico when normally it would take about 6 hours. I was a freshman in high school and all I really remember was everything being at a complete standstill. Gas stations were out of gas, it was pretty hot out, and a part of me hoped that we’d all get out of our cars and have a party on the freeway (must’ve watched too many music videos growing up). Honestly I thought it was fun because it was out of the ordinary, but I was like 14 and had a small view of the world so I didn’t realize how much of a bad time it was for others."
"I was in high school and remember my dad saying we weren't leaving till a cop knocked on the door and told us to, which we did. It took us 30 minutes to drive from the southeast side to Atascocita, where we stayed with family friends for maybe 2 days."
"shit show.  but the choice was easy.  my bff's in-laws in Dallas had a 7 bedroom house, pool with a cabana and a fully stocked bar.  I emptied the freezer and we grilled and drank for 3 days.  the 10 hr drive to Dallas sucked....."
I turned on thr TV at 4 am and saw all that traffic.  We stayed in our home. One of the decisions I've ever made.
I remember sitting there with my parents headed north on 45 and traffic wasn’t moving at all. We had the radio on and the radio guy started saying that they had just announced all southbound lanes were available for heading north now. I saw a bunch of cars jump to the other lane right then and my dad did the same. We had barely made it to Willis from Conroe in about 2 hours at that point. What a fucking mess
"We took the HOV lane out, which some parts are on a ramp with cement dividers only made for one lane and an emergency shoulder. We couldn’t leave early because my boss made me work. Some asshole decided to bring his giant RV into the HOV lane and got stuck because his shit was too wide for the lane. So many cars were then stuck because there was no way to get out with hundreds of cars all backed up behind everyone. Spent 8 hours stuck there with two cats and a dog. I hope that asshole learned his lesson, though I’m sure he didn’t give a fuck."
"I was a kid and remember waking up at 4am. There was traffic in the freeways already. My dad decided to avoid huge roads and take back roads. We got to Oklahoma in 10 hours. Most hotels were booked along the way and we decided to get as far as possible.
We had Dennis for breakfast the next morning"
I was in the backseat playing Pokémon fire red without a care in the world
We were under a mandatory evacuation in Pearland. It took 9 hours to get to my mom’s house in Richmond. We took 90 the whole way. It would have been faster to walk.
"The school district closed at 2:00, I was on the road by 3:00.

I drove 45 mph or slower to Austin. Everyone on the road had either very small children or very old parents with them. Truck stops were very busy and I stopped for gas 3 times. It took hours, but it was ok. 

My parents left the next morning at 5am. They drove less than 5 miles in 2 hours, turned around and went home to ride out the storm.

We all live on the Northeast side of town."
Hell
Spent 16 hours in the car for a normally 4 hour drive
"Lol we evacuated to north Houston area for Rita. We lived in Texas City at the time 2 blocks from the water. It was hellish getting there for sure, despite leaving 3 days before."
Terrible. I had to pee in my dogs water bowl in front of my family.
I remember seeing dead dogs and pets lined up on the side of the road. It was hot that day. I had my dog in the car and got scared.
Took me 17 hours to drive from the Heights to my cousins house in College Station. 🥴
"Took me 6.5 hours to get to ColdSpring, TX where my parents lived. We bought the last gas in town and went to hunker down.

Then the storm went further east than anticipated and we experienced high winds and the full hurricane experience. At 3 AM the roof of the house next door came off and crushed my parents garage cover.

We waited until noon the next day and bugged out back to our house in League City where we had power and everything."
"We(high school me, my mother, and my grandmother) lived in Waller. The earlier projection had it coming SW of Houston and then heading towards College Station which would have put us in the direct path. My uncle came and picked up my grandmother to get her out of harm's way as she would have been very uncomfortable if we lost power for any extended time. They left Waller before sunrise and made it to my grandfather's house(they divorced 205 years prior) near Logansport, LA just before sunset. A normally 4 hour drive took over 12.
The next day, the storm shifted and ended up running straight up the state line and was still damaging even that far up. They ended up without power for a week at grandpa's. After about a day, uncle took them to a hotel in Tyler. I sat on the back porch in Waller and played internet games while watching the storm pass us well to the east."
"For those of you who experienced Rita, how bad did the weather end up getting? I wasn't here in Houston during Rita, so I don't really know."
"Absolutely miserable. 6 hour drive took 25. Felt like I could've walked faster.

Only saving grace was that nearly everyone else stuck in the mess was cool. Everyone was frustrated,  but seemed to miraculously realize that we were all in the same situation. 

Honestly, at this point anything less than a solid 4, and I'm not leaving again. I'll send the wife and kids inland, but days in advance. Personally, I'd rather ride it out. 

Trees are all trimmed, solid (new) roof, house didn't flood, even during Harvey, and plenty of supplies. I'm set."
Took 20 hours to get to Dallas from East Houston
Took my family and I 12 hours to get to Waco. I recorded the whole day on an old VHS.
"Left my office, car ran out of gas on 45 and I walked about 6 miles home in a suit and heels 😑"
"We were down in Webster in a mandatory evacuation zone. My parents had a camper and we took it. My mom for her birthday asked for one of those massive Texas map books that shows every road down to just about pig trails. 

We used that to wind our way south first then go through subdivisions, backroads,one road that was a dirt trail through a field that may have been private property, and managed to make it to San Antonio in about 8 hours because of that map book. 

It was extremely stressful and poorly thought out. We had packed the family photos and our computers because under the prediction our house was supposed to be 5ft under water. 

And then nowhere near the disaster predicted. Then of course Ike came next, no evac and ripped the roof off our house, and there were so many trees down my dad was driving around with his sawzall for days after it."
I was lucky to be in my car for only 12 hours with a cat and a dog.  Many were much less fortunate.
I was in Austin at the time but my friends that drove up from Htown to crash at my house had to detour from Sugar Land to College Station to Austin.  I can't remember the exact time it took anymore but it was either 8 hours or 12 hours.
"We like everyone else were trying to go to Dallas but we didn't even make it past Spring and i took hours. We had our pets, and my elderly grandmother in the car (RIP). She was getting really pale in the car and so we pulled over the first chance we got. We found a store near a gas station and begged them for any help for grandma we could get, and they actually let us stay with them!"
"We drove down to Houston from Austin to pickup my dog from my grandpas house and my aunt because we didn't know any better back then. We live near Mission Bend. We never did that again as leaving took too long lol.

I remember it took probably about 4 or 5 hours for us to make it to my uncles place in Cameron TX. 

Ike we lost power for about 5 days. Didnt lose power during Harvey. We got a generator during Ike and we still have it to this day."
36 hour drive to San Antonio
AWFUL. I believe we drive from clear lake to downtown in 7 hours.
"It was the closest I've come to experiencing a real zombie scenario.  It's also the only time I gave up following the rules and drove on the shoulder to escape the endless sea of cars running out of gas and becoming stranded in the middle of the highway.   Even after I escaped the mess, every single gas station I visited was closed or bone dry.  The last few were just full of panicked, desperate people who were getting dangerous.  The last gas station I drove by was actively being looted for supplies and I got out of there fast.   

It eventually occurred to me that most of the time, shipping roads will run parallel to highways, so as a last ditch effort to find gas, I took the first exit I saw and traveled perpendicular to the highway hoping to find a gas station that everyone had passed up.   It was the right decision because I found a calm, normal gas station less than a mile from the chaos I had left behind.  They had gas, moonpies and big-gulps, and I stocked up.   I ended just using the shipping highway as far as I could, because it was completely empty!  I guess no one had considered it for an evacuation route.  

I got all the way to college station and friends without further incident."
Stayed and drove ATV’s on Katy Freeway the next day because it was an absolute ghost town.
Fucking terrible
9 hours in the car and didn't even make it to Rankin road from katy.  Turned around
"I didn’t evacuate… I chose to stay. I remember I was on my way to work and decided to put gas in my car because there was a bit of a line and I am a freak about having gas in my car. 

I went to work and we closed early. We chose not to evacuate because my dad had a flight from Miami arriving and we didn’t want to leave without him…
Yes, his flight arrived and he drove home (southwest Houston).

I ended up loaning my car to a friend and her mom who wanted to evacuate and bc my car had gas.
It took them over 24 hours to get to Austin. Everything was gridlocked. I boarded up the house as best I could which was actually quite difficult. 

Lots of people and pets died. Cars were abandoned bc they broke down, ran out of gas. People were dumping their water out to fill the jugs with gas. 

Then it barely even rained."
"It was when my college parent's weekend was. So my mom was supposed to drive from Houston to Memphis that weekend to be with me but she decided that wasn't a good idea. 

I was little upset at the time (though I'd never tell her) but in the end I was glad she didn't because she would have been stuck in traffic and have never made it. 

As it was she stayed home and experienced slight rain and a small breeze.

What people forget is it was literally like right after Katrina so everyone who wasn't used to hurricanes was scared shitless."
Faster to walk. Could barely get out of neighborhood. Parentals decided they would rather die in the house than on the road and turned around.
"My own experience: we had a toddler and a baby. We had just moved into a new house, but the old one was still vacant and under contract. We had two cats. 
So: do you pack up kids & pets & worry about what you left behind? Or do you stay and hope you can endure? 
We decided to try to go to our relatives near Dallas. Packed the car with essential paperwork, a few items of emotional value. From the Heights, we immediately hit heavy traffic (it took hours), and before we reached Beltway 8, someone rear-ended us. It could have been SO much worse, and the driver was so apologetic. But with two tiny screaming kids and two cats in a damaged car, we decided to just turn around and stay home. As I recall, it stormed, but our area was spared the worst of it. 

What sticks in my mind about that period is the day or two before, and realizing what is critical in my life, and what is just replaceable stuff. And the fear and uncertainty making the decision to go or stay; even with plenty of resources and insurance, it’s terrifying to leave knowing you might never come back to what you left."
Hot minivan. Hours just to get to the freeway. Stopping at mattress Mac and getting the best hot dog of my life
Pure hell. Just tow end up right in the eye of the storm 🥴
Fucking terrible. I remember that
"I lived near Baytown at the time, and the forecast put me right on the edge of the flood zone. Plus I lived right on a creek in an area that was prone to flooding, so my wife and I made the decision to evacuate westwards, to friends we had living in Seguin. [I had a short blog post about it at the time](https://www.kpcnsk.com/?p=96), and the main takeaway was that it was a really long day. Fourteen hours for what should have been a three hour trip. But we also got really lucky. Our car was a diesel VW Jetta, so in addition to getting high MPG, we were able to fill up at a gas station where that's all they had left.

We got stuck for the longest time on an HOV overpass just east of Katy, and just east of where they eventually opened up the contraflow lanes. Our lanes started moving while the main lanes were still gridlocked, and when we had the opportunity, we jumped into the left lanes of I-10. It was surreal, not only because we were driving on the left, but also because we were moving while all the traffic on the right was stopped. I was grateful, but it also felt wrong. Lots of people jumped the median, so now they have the barricades stretching between Houston and San Antonio.

While we were stopped on the overpass I got out and walked around, talking to others like everyone else. I met someone who had their family in the car, as well as their dog. The guy claimed his dog had died. I was a bit in shock, but they guy shrugged his shoulders and said, ""that's the way it goes."" That was the most horrific part of my experience.

Mostly people were friendly and helpful. The day was a clusterfuck, but people made due."
Like hell.. took me 24 hrs to get from Clear Lake to North side of town & ended up in a hotel.
I was very young then. I learned that you get out as soon as possible when they very much mean a bad storm is coming.
This evacuation took me and my family 17 hours to make it from Galveston to Dallas. We left on evacuation day about noonish. I remember hitting the cuts in Houston. Some roads were blocked off with unattended barricades. Knowing the Houston roads put us several hours ahead most others that were stuck on I-45. This drive is the main reason I like 4X4 trucks. Watching the folks in Conroe exit the freeway and hit the feeder while I was stuck in traffic( in my front wheel drive) was an eye opener.
"Had a great GPS and was able to get off the highways and take the backroads to Livingston after only threeish hours, where we were promptly hit by the hurricane, all while our house south of Houston had seven small limbs downed and zero other damage."
My parents attempted to evacuate up 59. They left from the Alief area and after 9 hours they had almost made it to Humble. They turned around and stuck it out.
"It took 9 hours to get 35 miles only to end up in a parking lot just north of Greenspoint. We ran out of water, gas was dangerously low, and one of our 2 dogs died of the heat. Didn't run the a/c to save on gas and with the windows open the exhaust fumes made us sick. The drive back to Sugarland took 45 minutes. I'll never do it again. 

On the bright side everyone was kind to one another, and helped where they could. It brought out the best in people."
"My roommates left, while I stayed. They got stranded on a chunk of highway where some damn med transit bus... Blew up? The oxygen tanks or something went bad in them. Long story short, they were evacuating from a hurricane that barely touched our side, so they could get stuck in their van on the highway for like 13 hours."
"I drove around North Houston the day of ""landfall"". It looked like an apocalypse but you could get anywhere you wanted to go (nothing was open, there was no where to go) in a fraction of the time. You didn't even need to stop at lights or stop signs. It was like the beginning of COVID."
"It was WILD. I was working downtown as a tech at the BMW dealership. 

I had their roadside assistance vehicle and I started getting calls for people running out of gas. The operatorn would ask ""how long until I could arrive"" and I'd say something like ""between 2-7 days"" 😂 
I just ended up turning off the phone, as I knew I couldnt be useful with anything on that front. The dealership offered $500 cash to come down and help move cars into the shop. I had a motorcycle at the time so I figured I could bomb down there and back pretty easy. I decided to take Hardy down from spring, and the southbound lane was literally empty from 1960 all the way down to 59. I didn't pass one car.  People were just sitting on the center divider watching me- northbound lane was gridlocked, no one was moving for hours. I made it from 1960 to downtown  in less than 10 minutes 😁😁😁
Once we moved all the cars we could,  I decided to take the HOV back up 59.... The HOV turned into a log jam around the 610 area, so I backtracked to the last exit and street fought my way up 59 and back roads to 1960- all roads north and I mean *all roads* north were filled with traffic. Gas stations out of gas turned into refugee camps where people were essentially using the pump as a shelter. Cars were out of gas *everywhere*. I remember after the storm the national guard driving around filling all the cars up with the big tanker trucks. 

It took me over 2 hours of driving in the grass, over curbs, between cars, lanes, etc to get back home. 
People didn't see Intersections any longer, they were suggestions. There was no law anywhere. You could do whatever you wanted. It was bananas.

I went up to 45/Louetta bridge overpass and tried to help with people getting to the south side of 45 for contraflow- most cars got stuck in the grass trying to drive over it which was also very entertaining. 

Other than that, spring didn't get destroyed by the hurricane for the most part- obviously a ton of flooded cars .... For me short of a fence getting blown over and no power for a week it wasn't bad."
"Like everyone else in Houston, we were spooked by the recent events in Louisiana and so we joined the evacuation. It took us nine hours to get to Dallas, using mostly back roads. Four of us plus our dog. Finding time to stop and walk the dog was no problem because we were stopped all the time. 

Shoutout to the Plantersville police and fire departments. The firehouse near the 105 opened its doors to the public to provide shade, water, and restrooms. The police got officers out to the intersection to help move traffic faster. 

After it was over, I was amused by Houston leadership's declaration of the success of the evacuation. No, it was a debacle. More people died in the evacuation than from the storm."
"Took my husband 18 hours to drive from Spring Branch to Dallas. He was working in Houston and I was still in Dallas. He couldn’t go to work because his job was located in a mandated evacuation area. 

When Ike rolled around a few years later, we were both living in Spring and had my elderly mom living with use. Hubby couldn’t evacuate because of his job, but he insisted that my mom and me evacuate to Dallas. I said hell no, I’m not getting into a traffic mess like you did during Rita. Before I knew it, he had emailed a couple of plane tickets for us to fly to Dallas."
"Since this was 1 month after Katrina, my parents thought it would be a fabulous idea to evacuate to Louisiana where we had family. They kept reiterating that it was north Louisiana so its safer from a hurricane than south Louisiana. To me it was still Louisiana. What usually takes 5-6 hours took 26 hours and I developed a bad knee.

I was a freshman in high school and I remember my friends and I texting and IMing each other how much we love one another and to be safe. We were all fully prepared to never see each other again.

Random note: fast forward to 2020 and I'm ironically living in that same area we evacuated to and experienced my 1st cat2 w/ hurricane Laura and i got to be in the eye for the 1st time as well.

Coming back we saw many SUVs abandoned and every road and highway was empty. We came home and discovered we never lost power once. Then my poor cat got an upper respiratory infection since he was around my aunt's cat.

My parents never learned their lesson and forced me to evacuate with them for hurricane Ike. Pretty sure we were the only ones in Houston that evacuated for that one."
Oh. My. Goodness! I can't imagine being in that situation.
"My little brother had diarrhea. He was maybe 3 years old. We convoyed in two vehicles with about 10 people including the kids. By the time we got to my great grandparents' house in the Tyler area, he was wearing someone's shirt with safety pins somehow holding them on and all his clothes had been left roadside cause we had no other way to deal with that hell in the 12 or so hours we were on the highway in near standstill traffic."
21 hours in my F250 with a pregnant wife and 3 year old to only make it 40 miles from home. We finally turned around and went back. Worst trip ever.
"A 58 hour sleep deprived nightmare. Watch folks draw guns in each other. 

Shit on the side of the road

An ended up in a town that took the eye of the storm. 

Did CPR on some dude at the hotel
When we finally got there who decided to try and swim. Drunk. Even though he didn’t know how to swim 

PTSD."
"And do forget, it did not hit here.  People just freaked out post-katrina.  Evacuate Katy!"
"Spent 6 hours going from Seabrook to Montrose

We took back roads the entire way also, every freeway was pretty much at a stand still."
"it was scary… saw people driving (nay flying) in the oncoming traffic lane on country roads… other people with cars and families broke down on the side of the road… it was a dark dark day… and we were lucky ones, only took 4 hours to get somewhere safe"
"I tried to get out of town with my cat because my mom was panicking about me staying on my own in Meyerland. I didn't get far and was almost out of gas after several hours. I called a friend and he said I my cat and I could stay with him. He also let another friend come to stay as well (she's a chef which is important later). I picked her up and we cleaned out our refrigerators and went to our friend's place. When nothing happened, she cooked everything and we invited some other friends over and had a feast."
"I was very young but I could remember the chaos when evacuating. My parents ended up running out of gas , ditching our car on the side of the road & hitching a ride back home. Idk what happened to the car till this day but it was replaced. 

&#x200B;

So much for evacuating lol"
"I lived in the Galleria area at the time, it was wild watching everyone overreact to a cat3 cause cat5 Katrina had just wrecked NOLA. Galleria area is 60 miles inland! 

I bought a bunch of discount meat at Kroger, they were trying to clear inventory. Cooked some meat and enjoyed a rainy day at the house, wasn’t bad at all. 

I took a stroll down the middle of Westheimer before the storm made landfall cause there were almost zero people left in town, no cars. Felt like a zombie movie, was super surreal."
"We lived in Katy then in the Cinco Ranch area. It took us what seemed like 3 hours to get from our house to the Merrill Center which is usually about only 15 minutes away… 

I remember distinctly telling my dad that at this rate, we’ll be stuck in the car when it hits so worst case, we  either die in the car or die at home 😅 we drove home and roughed it out. While Katy got some damage, it wasn’t anywhere as bad as the coast - so we were honestly very blessed."
"I was a Junior at U of H, living on campus, while my family was back in Port Arthur.  There was initial hesitation to leave because the last time we had evacuated (can’t even remember the storm) we went all the way to Austin and the only weather they got in PA was a regular old thunderstorm.

Eventually my Mum decided it was prudent to get out of Dodge but she definitely didn’t leave as early as she should have.  It took longer than expected but eventually she and my 2 brothers & sister made it to the apartments to scoop me up.  

I had a backpack ready for a quick overnight stay, no entertainment readily available, but figured I’d just be sleeping the trip away.

To compress the longest part of the story, it took 17 hours to drive from UH to The Woodlands Mall.  Gridlock was an understatement - my brother and I were literally on 45 N dribbling a basketball, to get a reference for how thick traffic was.  Contraflow wasn’t even an idea it seemed so you had the  northbound lanes at 110% and southbound COMPLETELY empty with the exception of a random law enforcement vehicle every once in a while.

Mum had a used, not well maintained Ford minivan and several hours into the trip it overheated and we had to pull over for a good hour for it to recover.  Cell phones were useless paperweights, as every provider’s (2G at the time) network was at max capacity.

Eventually she was able to get through to my cousin who lived near 45/1960 and we were extended an invitation to ride it out at her apt.  The 5 of us occupied the living room and spent the night through what ended up just being moderate rainfall.

We found out Port Arthur was an absolute ghost town and many of the ones who stayed took pleasure starting arguments with the frustrated parties who chose to evacuate.

I’ll never forget that evacuation and have always strived to keep myself in a financial position to be able to leave at a moment’s notice in case of emergency."
We left a couple days ahead of time and watched the shit show from Dallas.  Unbelievably stressful even from a distance.
🤣
I went dove hunting. There was a line of cars evacuating as I got out of my truck dressed in camo with a shotgun. Got some scared looks and lots of windows rolled up.
"Late to this post, but I was a kid (7f) when we evacuated. I remember standstill traffic.  My dad was in his truck while my mom, me, my brother (2m), and 3 cats were in the car behind him. Nobody knew how long the traffic was going to last or when we'd be able to get gas again. We were on the highway not moving for many many hours, so eventually everyone turned their cars off. It was HOT, the cats pissed, my brother was crying, and I didn't understand why we couldn't just keep the car on for the AC. My parents were convinced we were still in danger of flooding where we were (ecavuating from Beaumont) so there was palpable anxiety. My mom was rationing water for us but didn't have enough for the cats (nobody planned to be stuck on the road this long) so she sent my dad to walk around and look for a puddle or something to get water for the cats. A pregnant lady came by and asked for water and food, I don't remember if my mom gave her some or not but they talked for a while. Eventually we started moving but I remember we left at like 5am and the sun was setting in my memory of us finally being on the highway but idk if that's totally accurate. 

I remember it being kinda scary but mostly annoyed that we couldn't turn on the AC or get out of the car to play, but looking back I feel so bad for how scared my parents must have been."
"Evacuating wasn’t too bad from what I remember, I was 13 at the time.  On the way back it was terrible.  In stalled traffic for like 2 hours I ended up having to get out of the car to go shit in the woods and use notebook paper"
"Agh don't even remind me! 

We were in dickinson Texas. It was my aunt, 2 female cousins, one was 7 months pregnant. And their 2 boyfriends. 

For some reason we were all scared it would flood like it had in Katrina in New Orleans. We put all our furniture high up as much as we could. Like the couch on top of the diner table etc. We were all scared our cars would flood too. And I think most people were thinking the same and added to the traffic. 

We left around 1pm to Livingston tx to one of my other male cousins who were staying there at the time with in-laws. But about an hr into traffic on i45, they called us saying we could come stay, idk some bs. So we decided to head all the way up to Dallas because every hotel room north of Houston was booked in advanced. So we headed from clear lake to Kemah to take hwy 146 because we thought somehow it would take less. But every road was the same. 

From there I just remember I was driving in bumper to bumper traffic. I was driving alone in my 97' blazer. We weren't the only ones traveling in groups. People would even put socks on their antennas so they would show how many of them were in a caravan. So people were getting very aggressive with the ones that wanted to drive on the shoulders or mediums to cut in front of people. One group in a pick up was threaten me because I didn't want to let them get in between me and my cousin in front of me. I didn't know where we were going, my cousins bf was leading and I was the last car. So I didn't want to loose sight of them. Some traffic lights were being respected, some barely. 

We were also worried about fuel. All gas stations were packed and a lot out of gas. We did get to refuel though a few times thankfully. Cell phone connection was a huge issue. Around that time most of my cousins had sprint phones that could work as walkie-talkies and those sometimes worked. Only my phone with Verizon worked for some reason. But would lose signal often. 

It took us about 30 hours, from 1pm to about 7pm the next day to get to tyler going through Crosby, up to Livingston then Nacadoches, taking back roads when we could. 

Once there we rented this old house from my cousins bf family for the night at least. Over night my truck got broken into and my phone stolen, because I only had a car charger. They went through all my stuff though that I had packed. 

The next day we left back when people started saying it didn't cause much damage around dickinson. And the way back it took us like 6 hrs, many people started heading back but many still stayed out at least another day or more because down south by the coasts it did cause more damage. 

The next evacuation for Ike wasn't as bad. The evacuationplan was better organized by then. We left to Austin and only took us about 5 hours, when normally would be about 3 or less. 

Hope I never get to go through another one. And I'm hoping we are at least as organized as last time, even though it was already a long ago if there is a next time."
"My friends and I tried to go on a roadtrip to visit our friend in Amarillo.

Didn't really work out so well. So we uh.....""entertained ourselves"" in our friend's van for several hours.

Then we went home, and it took us 5 minutes to get back.  
LOL"
"I was a young kid when Rita happened, but I still remember we managed to make it to La Grange and we ended up hunkering down there as a last resort. We left a bit later than we probably should've and the entire experience was absolutely miserable. Felt like we were in the damn car for eternity.

My family and I haven't evacuated for any other hurricane or tropical storm since, including Ike and Harvey, but we consider ourselves lucky that our street and house didn't flood during Harvey but some houses a few streets down did."
"Good example of the madness of crowds…. 

And how incompetent or malevolent “authorities” can scare people into endangering their lives - by following the directions of “experts” and “authorities”

Anyone else see a repeating pattern???"
"This pic alone brings gives me PTSD.... Driving and running out of gas was out biggest fear, it took us almost 9hrs to get to San Antonio from Katy... And that's normally a 2hr drive, I was prepared and had extra 5gal tanks in both cars. ... 

Looking back, we should have stayed home.  We were far enough inland, but it was our first hurricane since moving to Houston and the weather man made it out to be something it wasn't..."
"I was in 4th grade and the school us told the day before it hit and sent us home early. My dad had just left for the airport for a business trip. We called him, but he had already landed. He booked a flight the second he got off of the plane and came back home, we stayed home and didn’t evacuate. Then the next few days we found out it missed Houston and turned into Katrina."
"It was shit. Hot as hell, had the dog in the car, the car died. Ended up in Hockley."
I left Sugar Land w my kids at 7 am. No traffic. Stayedin Waco. (Nice little zoo there btw.) Neighbors sat in traffic five miles from here overnight. No damage. Didn’t even lose power. We never do. Must have a big shot in the neighborhood?
That looks like every day houston traffic
So much traffic. Took a day to drive to Austin. I was small so I can’t remember much but I should have evacuated for Ike because Rita didn’t do much damage where I’m living at.
"Stayed during hurricane Alicia 1982.  The eye passed right over the house.  Seeing the wind stop, things got real quiet and when the wind reversed trees went down and all wooden fences.  No flooding or damage to my home.  Lived in Sugar Land during hurricane Ike, 2008.  Amazingly house was very quiet inside during storm.  Trees broke apart and my neighbor across the street had a really big tree go down and did immense damage to their house.  I had no damage to house.

Moved to the coast and was living right on the water during Hurricane Harvey in 2017.  Was a cat 4 hurricane  when it made landfall over Texas and Louisiana.  We got 55""-65"" of rain in a fairly short time.  Lived on a canal that fed right into Galveston Bay and the water never accumulated."
It was hell on Earth.  Over 24 hours to get to Dallas.
16 hours on the road due north on 45 and we made it to Huntsville. We slept in the parking lot of the Walmart in Conroe.
"I spent eight hours on 59 just going from the Beltway to Will Clayton (that’s like 3.5-4 miles). We could’ve literally crawled on our hands and knees faster than traffic was moving. 

I said fuck it, turned around and went back home. Rita blew over like a fairly intense thunderstorm— but we had no damage, no flooding, no loss of utility service."
*days
"10 hours to get to Livingston. I remember coming home right after and seeing thousands of cars on the sides of the roads, from so many running out of gas. It was an awful experience."
"It felt about how it looks. Rush hour traffic all the way to Dallas, took like 16 hours from Spring. 

It was our first hurricane so we had no idea what we were in for. Even with a direct hit we should have stayed put, and we did for Ike."
We hunkered down. Lost power. Everything in town was shut down.
6 hours from hwy 6 in sugar land to Kingwood. 24 total hours to Little Rock - storm was worse there than home. Fuckin hell
8hr drive from Texas city to Baytown driving up 146.
My family drove for 10 hours before turning back around and making it home in under an hour
Wouldn't have been as bad if the State Troopers would have stopped opening up the Houston inbound lanes to outbound traffic only for every other municipality to force all traffic back to outbound lanes only. Traffic would free up for 10 miles and then you wouldn't move again for a few hours. If they would have kept them open a certain distance and then force everyone back to normal lanes and leave it alone traffic would have been MUCH better. I swear we split and merged I45 6 times on the way to Dallas. We left from the Woodlands and it took 24 hours to get to Dallas.
"Drove in a convoy with my folks. They had packed their shit up. I basically had nothing. My Grandma rode with me and had to pee the instant we started moving on the beltway. 

We're in the Bay Area and headed towards friends in the Woodlands via the beltway. That route kept us clear of the absolute nightmare that was 45. Truthfully, it wasn't that bad for us. My buddy and his family went north up 45 and got stuck in the shit. Lost two cats. Ran out of gas."
Hope yall stay safe out there
"Was at home, woke up to my mom telling me to get in bed with her and my dad I had a huge hole in my ceiling"
"Left for Austin at 6 am. Made it in 2.5 hours. Friends that left at 10 am, took a whole 24 hours."
I super lucked out and already had plane tickets to Dallas for a wedding. Left my husband at our apartment alone. He said it was awesome though. Empty streets. Only place open was Specs.
[deleted]
"My friend spent over 12 hours getting to San Antonio which was apparently speedy at the time. My late husband and I sat on the covered patio drinking wine, calling friends to see how far they had gotten, and guessing the speed of the wind gusts. 

It would have to be a massive storm for me to evacuate. Rita taught us all a huge lesson."
"Got 2 miles out after 2 hours, gave up and figured we’d rather drown at home than on the road."
Sat in traffic with my mom and sisters for 24 hours over 2 days to get to my grandparents house in Shreveport. Normally this drive took just under 4 hours. We got hit harder by the storm in Shreveport than our house in Houston did. Fun times
Just like that picture
I remember being on the road for 18hrs and only making it 30mins from our house.
Spent 28 hours to get to Austin. We waited for our evacuation time too. Last timeme and my family do that.
"We decided to go stay with family friends in Little Rock, which is an 8 hour drive from here. All I remember is that we left from home around 8/9 pm and reached the Brookshire Brothers in Livingston, only an hour and a half away, the next morning. Bumper to bumper traffic."
Took 12 hours to get to San Antonio. No where to park at gas stations. Men peeing on the side of the road in the wide open.
"My parents drove for two days and ended up just over the border in Louisiana, I forget the city. Of course Rita turned and they ended up being closer to the eye than if they just stayed in Houston."
"I was with my parents who were living in Brazoria County at the time and looking a direct hit.  I drove one car with my brother and my parents drove another with the dogs and the camper. We took back roads through Fortbend county over to 71 and I went to Austin and my parents and brother went to canyon lake. 

It took 5 hours to get to Austin, which isn’t great, but wasn’t crazy either. We left early enough we didn’t see any of the true craziness. I remember being completely stopped on alt. 90 for a bit. 

I had family members who left the same time we did, but took the interstate and ended up taking 10+ hours to get out."
"You had to decide between turning on the car to stay cool but running out of gas, or keeping it off and scorching in the heat.

I want to say more people died from the evacuation than from the actual hurricane."
Spent 8 hours in traffic where it normally takes MAYBE 30 minutes the same distance. Ended up turning around and going home before we run out of gas with 6 kids in the car.
"12-ish hours from Pearland to Austin. We left on the last evacuation day, which I want to say was a Wednesday. I just remember how eerie and still it was. I’d never seen Houston so empty."
Memorable
"I remember it being humid af and spending the entirety of the daylight hours in my car, only to say fuck this, turn around at Gallery Furniture and get back to Alief in 20 minutes."
Drove for 12 hours to get from Montrose area to about “1 hour” north on 59. About 800PM Rita was turned right so I busted a U turn and it was amazing being the only one driving the opposite way and going 70 after going 5 for 12 hours.
"We waited until the morning it was supposed to hit to leave. So much on the news about traffic, people running out of gas, cars catching fire etc. By the time we left, all the traffic was gone. It only took us 3 hours to get to Austin, but we drove with the windows down to save on gas."
It was hell. We left I thought early enough but I was wrong. A 6 hour trip turned into a 36 hour or 48 hour trip. All gas stations closed. The state of Texas dropped the ball in not closing I 45 south in a timely fashion and have people evacuating  on both sides. The state of Texas closed rest room facilities in rest areas. I saw a young girl sitting in a vehicle holding a small baby crying. I saw an old man trying to get an over heated car cranked. One major lesson is evacuate early. Have plenty of water and food. Before you leave clean out your refrigerator and freezer.
"I consider myself lucky, since I came home to Houston in 2018, the worst I’ve dealt with was the freeze in 2021"
"I was a kid then, we had a full tank of gas, but we spent so much time on the road that we eventually had to turn off the A.C. We were a family of seven so all of us, plus bags, PLUS my dog...It was hot cramped, miserable... Add to that, our dog (RIP ReyRey!), started getting nervous farts due to the overall energy of the car😭🫠. It was bad! 

Eventually, my dad couldn't take it anymore and gave up on fully evacuating. I'm not sure how we got out of the traffic (my dad might have done some not so legal maneuvers), but we managed to get to my aunt's house who was closest to where we were. They had planned to ride it out from the beginning. Once we got there it was actually a lot of fun, my cousins were our age, and we were childhood friends, so it was like one big sleep over (I have so many stories and fond memories of that night).
 
Eventually the house lost power, and my parents made the decision to leave as soon as the rain lightened up. The roads were abandoned, a ghost town. It usually took us 30-45 minutes to drive back from my aunt's house in the suburbs of Cyfair, but that day it takes like 15 minutes. Ironically, our house still had power."
"My husband was a teen and said they sat in traffic for 6 hours, then turned around and was home in 20 minutes."
"I waited a couple of days, then did the speed limit all the way to Dallas. 45 looked like a disaster movie."
"We used the back roads to get to the north-west of town. It felt like we were a mile or two ahead of every warning of heavy traffic that we heard as we made our way to family in College Station.  Even afterwards, when all the gas stations along the major routes were out of gas, we managed to find a place on a lesser-used road and got back home with no problems."
Took us 8 hours to get to Dallas.  Through the back towns and such. Coming back to Houston everything was pitch black.  We didn’t have light for 2 weeks.
We were on the road 14 hours and made it 20 miles. Turned around and tried again the next day lol
Nightmare. Evacuated to some friends in Arkansas. Normally a 6-7 hour drive took me about 20
Took 6 to 7 hrs to get to Austin took a lot of super small back roads normally takes 2 hr 40 min.  I had my laptop with a Microsoft map program and was able to take the back roads with this program.
"From Pasadena to Katy: 14 hours

Turning right around and going back to Pasadena? 45 minutes."
"My spouse was overseas on business. I called him to say come home now about three days before, but he was busy and didn’t realize how bad it would be. So he came home two days later as the storm was about to make landfall.  The buses to parking had already closed at IAH which was also closing, but he was lucky to hitch a ride to his car with a business associate. By the time he got home, the roads were already packed and he wanted to sleep. I was watching the freeway cameras for Hwy 290 to Austin, and around 1am the road looked clear. We loaded up our two teen sons and dog, got my elderly mother to drive to our house (heavily treed Willowbrook area) and left in a three car convoy around 2 am.

It worked fine until about 15 miles out, then looked like the apocalypse.  Standing still traffic—we moved about 3 miles in an hour. Cars on the side of the road out of gas, people sitting on their trunks wondering what to do, all of it under sodium lights that made it look hellish. Everything was jammed up to the bridge over the Brazos. There’s only one in that area, so it was the clogging point. After a few hours we finally made it over the bridge, the took the next backroad and hightailed it over washboard dirt roads at 3-4 am. Finally made it to Austin about 9 hours later where we stayed with a friend. 

Came home three days later to find (thankfully) no damage. Ike dropped a tree on the house and Harvey flooded us just enough to gut the lower half of the house though."
"It was stupid.  I moved a mile and a half over a couple of hours.  Did the math, realized I'd be halfway to austin when the storm intersected with me, turned around and enjoyed the gentle thunderstorm in my apartment."
We saw the traffic and hunkered down. My oldest was only 6 months and very impatient.
"We left the house, made it 4 blocks and into a traffic jam.  The guy on the radio said I-10 is solid all the way to San Antonio so I went by the liquor store and back home.  Lost 1 branch off of a magnolia tree."
"We live northwest of town in a rural area and we had decided to just hunker down. I went with my mom to go check nearby convenience stores for ice. We got near 249 and were gobsmacked to see it was a parking lot, people walking up and down the side of the road, cars stopped all over. We turned and went home, figuring if there was any ice available those folks would need it more than we did."
12 hours to college station. The chicken express was a beacon in the night. My 88 year old grandmother was a damn trooper.
"It took me 22 hours to drive to Dallas. Almost ran out of gas, spent the night in a Taco cabana parking lot, and enjoyed driving north in a southbound lane. My mom was freaking out about a ""prophetic"" dream she had of a giant tidal wave crushing our house. Nothing ended up happening aside from a power outage and some downed branches."
Imagine that situation with todays ev’s
Family friends drove up from Alvin to my house when I lived in Central Texas for a time. They were on the road for 25 hours straight IIRC.
"I had a broken foot at the time and my mom had no interest being in the house with teenage me during a hurricane when I couldn't walk. 

So we went to stay with family north of Dallas, I can't remember which day exactly we left but I do remember it took us ""only"" 8 hours and I vividly recall listening to traffic reports about the wave of cars behind us. Like we were in Conroe and the report was 4 hours from Galveston to downtown, just past Madisonville the reports were 3 hours from beltway 8 to the Woodlands - things like that. We didn't stop for gas until we were in Dallas proper. If we had left even an hour later I'm pretty sure we would've been caught in the traffic jam."
"14 hours to Denton Texas, bumper to bumper even on county roads, something that would normally take 3 hours. Just chaotic overall, it was like a scene from an apocalypse movie."
"I stayed lol, had fun tho"
"We were scheduled to fly out of IAH for vacation right when it was supposed to be hitting Houston. Got our departure flight changed to DF/W and planned to drive there to catch our flight. Tried taking back roads, gave up after about 10 hours and turned around, I think it took us about 20 minutes to get back home."
"I left a couple days before absolutely nothing happened, early in the morning. Took me 14 hours to get just south of Fort Worth. I saw cars overheating, assholes blocking emergency lanes, and regular joes with big trucks moving concrete barriers to open up the southbound lanes on 45 to northbound traffic. I had put a leash on my cat's collar, attached to the backseat, so she wouldn't crawl under the brake pedal, and made a mini-box for litter from an old baking pan in the back floorboard. Next time, I'm staying put."
It took 8 hrs to get to Austin on 290. And ppl where driving in the shoulders and ditches.
12 hours from Angleton to Conroe
"I had co-workers who lived north of Woodlands - basically 100 miles from the gulf - who didn't even lose power for a minute, but spent 24 hours sitting in their suburvigator because they tried to evacuate to ""anywhere but here"".

If that picture was taken from a couple exits further up, I probably would be able to pick them out LOL"
"We went east, didn't know Rita would turn late. Every county we hit turned in mandatory evacuation. I had to go back to get work friends that stalled out in Lumberton, and when I exited to go get them, they turned 69 into all going north. We were on the road in 2 vehicles for 26 hours with a 5 yr old, a freaked out cat, 2 extra passengers and their stuff that we could fit into my vehicle plus all of our stuff. We made it to Fairfield. 26 hours...... to get about 2.5 hours away from our home. We didn't let that deter us from Ike evacuation. We just left later, smooth sailing to San Antonio that time."
"It took us 4 hours to get from Katy to Sealy 

Edit: I don’t remember when we left. I was a teen at the time"
23 hours Houston to Austin
"Group panic happens.
Learn multiple ways through the city.
Plot your Texas tour based on needs. My tía needed dialysis. We toured multiple dialysis centers across Dallas, Taylor, Austin, San Antonio, and Victoria before we returned to Houston."
Awful. My family headed towards south central Texas but not before boarding up or home here. My father sliced his hand open on those hurricane clips in the process but refused to get it looked at until we had made it to safety. Hours and hours on the road going nowhere fast. I believe he finally got stitches at a hospital near Victoria. I took a nap on a bench in a Walmart pharmacy at one point. When we finally made it to our destination many hours later we sat around with family and watched it miss our home completely. Haven't evacuated for a storm since (Ike/Harvey/Imelda) and probably won't again unless staying behind is almost assured of death and destruction.
"I stayed in my garage apartment in Montrose and I was grateful it was a nothing burger. But then there was Harvey, which damaged my home and I had to sell it at a loss because I couldn't afford to repair it."
"Oof. Many many hours sitting in a car. We left earlier than most, and it took like 8ish hours to get to Austin."
"This submission has been randomly featured in /r/serendipity, a bot-driven subreddit discovery engine. More here: /r/Serendipity/comments/18l24ob/people_that_evacuated_for_hurricane_rita_what_was/"
18 hours of misery to San Antonio. We were maybe 10 miles away from an empty tank + going full Mad Max
I remember driving for 23 hours straight that day and I believe we made it to Tulsa
Took 15 hours to get to San Antonio and my college roomate and I were in Huntsville. Everyone fled to Huntsville and it got some damage and was a wreck after people left. Then we had rolling blackouts for a month…. Fml
"Hell. Ran out of gas midway heading to Tyler,Tx"
I was in Willis watching from an overpass.
"It took me like 10 hours to ""drive"" to Conroe from south Houston. While sitting in the i45 parking lot I ran into a band I used to see weekly at last concert cafe and smoked a joint with them. The freeway was at a standstill it was like a tailgate"
"Watching Tim Heller ABC13 weatherman draw a straight line on the map, that showed it was coming directly towards Houston... Great day indeed."
19hrs from Houston to Dallas in a sedan with 3 adults and 3 children aged 10-13. We didn’t turn the AC on to save gas. I was one of the kids. I just would have rather be hit by the hurricane at home. We never evacuate anymore.
We drove to Corpus. Took 4hrs on backroads from Dickinson.
I stayed home.
We were in clear lake.  We waited till the storm was making landfall and drove to our hotel in downtown.  The city was completely empty.  We didn't see a car from nasa road to downtown...wild.
I was a kid but iirc it took us like a day and some change to get to Dallas. Three big things happened. One was a guy on a bike pulled up beside us and turned out he was an emt from an ambulance parked on a service road. He gave us water. Second was my dad got into a fist fight with some guy road raging lol. Third was at one point my dad’s leg cramped up so my mom drove and my dad laid on top of the car. Not fun
We left early and it still took six hours to get to San Antonio.
"It was horrible. I was working for a law firm at the time. And we were expected to stay till the end of work day. Meanwhile, people everywhere were frantic. The stores were bare. Gas stations had long lines and ended up running out of fuel. There would be “end of times” signs posted. It was so chaotic!

I originally was planning to stay home and ride out the storm But my fiancé wanted to leave. Unfortunately, what is usually a 30 minutes drive, turned into a 4 hour bumper to bumper stall and stop. We ended up at a family’s house in Tomball, Texas to ride out the storm."
"I was 6 and we evacuated from Port Arthur. The traffic was terrible, just like this pic. It took us about 18 hours just to get to college station. A lot of roads that would have been less trafficked were closed off and everyone was forced to take the designated evacuation route. Most gas stations on the way were out of gas. Also, FEMA had booked up the majority of available hotel rooms in Texas to help Katrina evacuees, so we ended up staying in cots at a church in CStat for a while. At the same time, my grandmother was in the hospital and was about to have her leg amputated. The National guard was transporting all the hospital patients and they refused to let families know where they were taking them. My grandfather worked hard to convince them to let him go with her, but he didn’t have a cellphone to communicate with us. So the whole time we were evacuating, my parents/family were trying to track them down. Eventually my grandfather called from a hospital in Little Rock, and after we were able to go home, my parents went to take care of them. I was a carefree 6 year old happy playing with a toy monster truck the whole time, but my parents were stressed tf out lol"
So horrible we moved to Dallas 6 months later so we’d never have to do that again.
Chaos
Took 17 hours to get to Dallas… more people died on the road that year than casualties from the hurricane itself. I’ll never evacuate again lol
"I don’t know why this showed up in my feed, but I lived in Aransas Pass during Katrina and Rita. For Rita, we evacuated towards San Antonio. I don’t really remember much, but I do remember we had the hardest time finding a hotel, and traffic was a nightmare."
"I can't say how long it took as I was just a kid at the time, but I do remember the traffic. My parents, our dog and I were loaded up in a vehicle.  I remember we had pulled off the road just to sleep because traffic was at a standstill. Left from closer to the gulf, not a houstonianian here but had to take houston evacuation routes ofc. We went to Palestine, TX to stay with relatives and our neighbor (who didn't evacuate) called to check on us and invite us to a BBQ. My family stopped evacuating for hurricanes after this, we stayed for Ike and Harvey."
"I was in college in a northern state. I was calling my family every 10 minutes because the news were making Rita more catastrophic than what it turned out to be and I had a really severe storm phobia so I was really worried.

Finally my aunt had to tell me to stop calling, they're fine. I didn't sleep a wink either that night for fear of what could happen."
Took four times as long to get to San Antonio. But at least we made it.
"I credit my dad for his navigations skills. Evacuated to Dallas, waited till a day or two before it was supposed to hit, took may be 7 hours or so to get to Dallas (normally take \~4). Once we got to i-45, passed Conroe, which took forever, my dad pulled his ATLAS (anyone even remember that?) and a giant map of Texas, and took us away from the interstate into backroads and there was hardly any traffic and gas stations had gas where we filled up.

I had family that stuck to I-45 and it literally took them 22 hours to get to Dallas."
13 hours to fort hood from east Houston. Paper maps and back roads. We had a 4 car caravan and it honestly was not that bad compared to other’s experiences.
Went to a family friends house to wait it out. Ended up being the right and fun choice lol
"I was doing real estate at the time so I had maps in my trunk. After sitting in traffic for 2 hours and only getting to 290, we used the maps to take side roads to Dallas. Took 12 hours."
"We did not evacuate for Rita. We had already driven to Biloxi MS to evacuate hubby's elderly aunt and uncle for Katrina, had them at our house in Houston. We felt pretty safe, and we had no issues during the storm.

But I watched the news (big mistake, talk about upsetting and stressful!). The traffic jams of people evacuating were so bad, people were running out of gas on the road, abandoning their vehicles, creating a worse traffic jam. Then people started dying from the heat/humidity. The final estimate of deaths from the evacuation was over 100.

The reason the jam was so bad was there was no order to the evacuation. Everyone from Beaumont to Katy started out at the same time, hit the roads, and came to a screeching halt.

This is why we have evacuation zones now. All of the variables are tracked -- where the storm might come ashore, where the storm surge will be bad, what roads may flood early, etc. Then evacs are called by zone. This does two things -- helps get the people at highest risk out first, and helps prevent the gridlock of Rita."
We had the windows down to conserve gas coz we didn’t know If we were gonna make it and gas was on short supply. It was a hot day but I spent most of my time playing Gameboy and crossword puzzles
"Was stuck on a city chartered evac Greyhound bus for the better part of a week.  
Mom didn't have a reliable car at the time, and we lived very close to the coast.  
Took 2 days just to get to Conroe, then the bus continued on to Lufkin, then a Christian Dude Ranch(a story in and of itself) for a day or two, then finally to Orange until we were dropped off at a Red Cross Shelter.  
At that point my mom and several other folks from our area managed to pool enough money to rent a van to drive back home.  
Prior to experiences in my military career, it was one of the shittiest adventures of my life, and the dirt in the wound was that Rita didn't even really have much impact in our area.  
The only reason the evacuation was so out-of-hand was because Katrina was so recent, so everyone panicked."
Katy should evacuate now!
"I worked at the Star of Hope at the time and I had to take a busload of residents on a bus to San Antonio. It took 18 hours. Before we were out of Houston (but had already been on the road about three hours) someone on the bus had a seizure. I directed the bus driver to pull off to the nearest hospital and when we pulled up, all the women started to get off to have a smoke break. I had always tried to be the chill staff member who didn't pull rank, I was in my mid-20s and most of the clients were my age or older, but I found my voice that day. I said ""Listen to me. I am taking her inside, signing her in and dropping her off. When I get back on this bus, it will leave. I am not counting heads, I am not taking names. If you aren't on the bus when it leaves, you will weather this hurricane on your own."" They all took their cigarette breaks with one hand on the bus. When we finally got to San Antonio, I got off the bus and vomited from stress.

&#x200B;

We were gone for 8 days and I was on the Nancy Grace show talking about it. We had an outbreak of scarlet fever. We were staying at a convent with nuns. It was a nightmare. It's also some of the most fun I ever had."
I stayed home and it was a bit breezy 😂
We didn’t evacuate specifically for this photo.  I cleared out the closet under the stairs and we slept in it.  That is the strongest part of the house.
"I didn't evacuate. Instead, I was burying my grandfather the day the storm was to make landfall, down near Galveston."
"My son was born 9 months later June 22nd.  The few days after Rita in Houston were the best,  no trafffic, no people, no noise.  Then everyone slowly came back."
Brooooo THE Worst!!! Spent about 30 hours on the road from I45 @ Scott until we hit maybe Huntsville. Slept in a Walmart parking lot 45 minutes outside of Dallas  the next night due to a flat tire. Stayed in Dallas two days and when I get back found my apartment robbed and ransacked.
Didn’t evacuate. Dad was a building engineer at a mall. We spent the time in their engineering room in the parking garage with our dog… actually went on the roof while it passed over… rather uneventful
"Took 17 hours to get to Austin. Departure from Eldridge and 6.

I will always respect Home Depot on the way. They were the only shop that kept their restrooms open for the people fleeing Houston."
"I really want to know what was at the front of that line. I have been it that type traffic, and still don’t understand what people are doing when they drive."
We halted out at the ford stadium. Got out played football exchanged snacks with other Houstonians after about an hour of a complete stop reality set in.. we were 5 hours from being hit with absolutely no movement. The Same small family we exchanged snacks with decided to drive off of the freeway into the feeder.. my dad frustrated & life long road rager decided to follow our 5 car fulls of family jumped off as well.. we drove the opposite direction and made it to our home in about 15min.. we live an hour away from that location 🤦🏽‍♂️.. decided if we were going to die it would be as a family… we didn’t die.. we were literally outside during the eye of the storm….
I'm from Surfside and as a kid it was chaos coming up 288. We went to Tomball and found a hotel. I remember my dad driving on the exit embankments to get up in traffic.
"We never made it to Dallas. After 15 hours, we ended up in a small ass town called Crockett and met up with some people out there. It was like 9 adults and too many kids in a 3 bedroom house. Somebody was sleeping on every sq ft of that place."
“A day of hell”
Chaos. I remember it like it was yesterday.
That was a terrible experience. Nobody wanted to take a chance after Katrina. I saw some things that I wish I hadn’t being stuck on the road. 6 hours and we only made it about 40 minutes outside of Houston.
I stayed home and got pregnant
"I was a kid, but I remember being stuck in traffic crying thinking the hurricane will get us if we don’t hurry. We went to my dad’s cousin’s house down in the RGV. It barely rains over there. A hurricane is rare."
"I remember that. It was anarchy on the north side, Conroe area. 5 gallon limit of gas. Chaos!"
