Wind speeds not seen in over 40 years? Even with the damage we're lucky it wasn't a more sustained storm
Question for the structural engineers here: I don’t recall electric transmission towers getting yeeted like they did yesterday during the last major hurricanes of the last decade. What happened? What was different?
 Is anybody here old enough to remember hurricane Alicia? She was nasty!  I’ll never forget that storm.
People who prefer a Hurricane over a Tornado must not be native Houstonian.
"You gotta remember she's talking to the entire county and saying that it could take that long before EVERYONE has their power reconnected.  Most people will probably have electricity in a few days, but for some it's going to take a bit longer."
"""CenterPoint doesn't know exactly the damage or how long it will take or who is ultimately tied into those transmission lines.""

Wait, what? So they don't know anything? They sound prepared for this."
"So I fucking LUCKED OUT getting power back at 10:30 in Katy, Holy shit."
Now that abbot uncapped the center point energy delivery fee prepare to be gouged.
Yay. Guess I’m not gonna play any video games for a while.
"What was the state of the Harris County grid before the storm hit? Was it in need of repairs and maintenance?

# Harris"
Texas goin for 3rd world country status.
"Bury the cable underground, makes it so much easier to deal with when shit like this happens, I swear why is Houston so dumbfuck when we live in an area that’s prone to this type of climate"
"Hurricanes are hitting Houston more frequently, putting our national energy infrastructure at risk. It’s time for the city to take serious action. This means burying power lines in high-risk areas, enforcing hurricane-resistant building standards, upgrading stormwater systems, building robust flood barriers and seawalls, enhancing drainage with high-capacity pump stations, elevating critical facilities above flood levels, and equipping key facilities with backup power systems. If Houston can’t commit to these measures, we must invest in a secondary energy corridor city that will. Our country’s stability shouldn’t depend on Houston’s current level of investment"

"Will there be any kind of accountability for this? Any recourse for victims or for all the food and perishables lost? Multiple weeks without power in a first world country, in one of the world's wealthiest cities, after a 2-hour storm is unacceptable."
Thanks for pointing out the obvious.
"Good, we needed the rain, and people who WFH to go outside and do some actual work"
