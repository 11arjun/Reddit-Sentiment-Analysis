"Being that it‚Äôs trash day today, I got extra trash cans for free from the storm."
Still gotta go to work üò≠ Thunder woke me up at 3am.
Paper plate blew away off my neighbor's Altima
Couldn't go back to sleep. Sleep damaged.
[We will rebuild](https://imgur.com/Jzbmf6z)
Neighbors house was hit by a lightning and the fire department was called as the house was on fire!
My trash bin tipped over. DEVASTATED
"The wind in spring was crazy 

[oak branch down ](https://imgur.com/a/Z65MGDi)"
"It‚Äôs crazy how the damage can vary so much, but my neighbor‚Äôs illegal trash dump made through the storm completely in tact."
Our fence of 20 years has gone to the great beyond
Computer apparently fried. Just heard a transformer across the street blow up.
"I swear every time a big storm blows over, I sleep through the entire thing and not even know it happened"
"Found out that my front door is clearly not sealed as well as it could be at the bottom due to the cuddle puddle that formed underneath it after waking up this morning.

Some neighborhood street flooding/standing water in Cypress area."
We lost our lavender plant.
"Heights had power, didn‚Äôt see a lot of debris on the ground on my way into the office. Just wet roads."
Just a few power blips and woke up to the thunder at 3 am.
It was crazy at like 2am-4am. Thankfully no damage that I could see. I was most worried about the roof but I walked around the house and it looks normal.
"Out NW near Willowbrook Mall, we're at 2.28"" through the gauge and that all fell between 3 and 4 AM.  Only 22 MPH gusts, power didn't even hiccup.  The thunder was really impressive.

We only had those super-loud explosive-sounding nearby strikes a few times, but the rumble of thunder was intense and constant.

No damage."
What storm? Slept through the night like a baby on benadryl
no power at the office (westchase)
"French doors decided to give us a vip front row experience to the wind and rain. 

And Firestone blew away."
"In cinco ranch, no power since this morning and waiting."
T1 üå™Ô∏è hit not far away from my place in Katy. Stores on Mason Rd just south of 10 have damage. See Jeff Linder on FB for pictures. My trash can tipped over. I‚Äôll rebuild!
I was outside during the worst of it. [https://youtu.be/m6mv1tWj0FU?si=yvn6pRZ4hP8YFmcl](https://youtu.be/m6mv1tWj0FU?si=yvn6pRZ4hP8YFmcl)
We‚Äôre up in Klein and power has been out in our neighborhood since 3:30am. We have some stoplight issues but nothing else major so far.
Woke up to no internet
I have standing water in the street. Insane.
Driving in to work and seeing all the debris I feel like a freak for having slept through it all. Granted I was tired as hell and didn't get to bed until a bit after 1AM but still.
Our trash can fell over and spewed our trash across the street. Was almost late for work picking it up this morning. :/
I didn't even notice there was a storm last night. Next to Brays Bayou.
Lost power for four minutes. My back up generator kicked on so all good. Still no internet from Xfinity.
Been up since 3am. Couldn‚Äôt fall back asleep so I stayed up until a coffee shop opened then caffeinated.
Trash cans blew away
"It was absolutely insane out west of Katy, just south of I-10. Lightning looked like a strobe light through the blinds for over an hour. I think I got up and looked outside the front door right as the tornado was touching down a few miles away. There was a wall of sideways rain."
"Power is still out :(

Edit: Power came back not a minute after this comment was posted :)"
Did everyone wake up at 3am??? Seems like it
"Hedwig Village: Some branches down on the way in lots of debris and trash, too, as folks had their bins at the curb. Work south of U of H. Fallen tree had me reroute off Telephone, but otherwise fine."
Humble checking in. Lost power for about 45 minutes while we were sleeping. I assume the stuff in the fridge is fine.
"Had two small dogs panicking and climbing up in bed with me, so some lost sleep, but that's about it."
"Thunder woke me up at night. I'm tired today. My cat was terrified, but happy to be alive this morning.

Otherwise, nothing amiss that I could see immediately."
Cypress. Lost a lot of sleep but power remained on. I can usually sleep through a decent storm but this one kept me up!
Power was just restored at jones and cypress north Houston
My largest oak in my back yard got hit by lightning. Huge limb of the tree fell on our house. We attempted to minimize the rain coming in until it stopped. Pretty gnarly storm.
I wrecked on beltway 8 at 4:10am. The storm was so bad I hydroplaned into concrete barrier.. Harris county gave me a ticket also‚Ä¶failure to control speed. Sore and shaken up with a totaled truck.
Lost sleep
Wasn‚Äôt too bad. But creeped myself out checking the [security camera](https://youtu.be/l0B6bB497rg?si=nkN8fSt4DJWVO_NE) Sounded like someone was trying to open the back door. Decided to peer at the camera and each time the sky lit up it looked like there was a skin walker moving. Turns out it was just a tornado  I‚Äôm off of Mason and when I went to work this morning wondered if someone drove into the highway sign. Didn‚Äôt find it till much later.
"Honestly if I could just get an update from centerpoint, that would be great. Said they were taking longer than expected and reassessing a couple of hours ago and nothing heard since"
"North of Houston, here.

I stayed up all night waiting for a storm that scarcely made an appearance. Some thunder. Some lighting. Some rain. 

Counting our blessings no hail, no wind damage, and electricity never went out."
"Reporting from just north of Brookshire: we got about 20 minutes of really intense lightning, followed by probably 40 minutes of heavy-ass rain, followed by maybe 15 minutes of fairly strong wind out of the NW. No hail and nothing super nasty, power never went out.

Main consequence this morning is that there's a shitload of standing water. I should have mowed after work yesterday, now it's gonna be several days before it's dry enough for that."
my power has been out for hours now
I had a few flower pots blow over. I hope everyone survived better than me.
"I‚Äôm very glad I forgot to put out the trash last night. All the cans in my neighborhood are spilled over & garbage is everywhere. That‚Äôs about it in my part of Clear Lake. We usually have trees or branches down if someone just breathes heavy walking down the street but from what I could tell, the trees are all good."
"All I lost was sleep... Cats freaking the fuck out.. trying to get into the master bedroom. Meowing for 2 hours. And Ive had early meetings..  
  
I don't nap, but I will at noon."
Still no power. Out since 2:48am.
"Never lost power, only sleep from my dog and 5y/o feeling the need to lay on top of me to stay safe."
There were storms last night?
"give Texas Power & Construction LLC a call if you need your surge protector installed or outlets repaired for a good price

7139602904"
"Finally got power back around 11:30am. Other than that, just a few small limbs in the yard.

Taking a shower by flashlight was interesting."
The storms were no problem. What is the problem is the absolute shit ton of termites that have spawned and are swarming in and around my detached garage. There's clearly a full blown colony in there and I am freaking out waiting for an exterminator to get here and hit me with a massive quote for treatment.
My plants are over watered.
"We have SEVERAL ‚Ä¶.several‚Ä¶.palm fronds that have fallen. Everywhere. 

We will rebuild."
My sleep will never recover. And then all the traffic lights on my way to work were on the red blink so my entire day was ugh.
Your education was unfair to you. You fared poorly.
But does Katy need to evacuate?
I didn't even know we had a storm
There was a storm?
"I hope there's no airport delays, I'm thinking of going to Cancun."
My place is okay. I saw a lot of fallen trees/big branches on the road on the way to work.
"Some power lines are down, and we lost power for about five minutes. It's still intermittently pouring here though.

4/10/24 never forget"
"Historic Heights: there is a line of leaves in the street down on the corner, so I guess it flooded a bit."
"Bayous are 3/4 full, lots of small to medium branches down. Lights are flashing red on highway 6 just south of 290"
Lots of heavy banging that woke me but no damage around that I can see Montrose/River Oaks border.
All good here in the southeast
Lots of downed tree limbs in the clear lake area
All good here in Montrose. A few tree limbs down but that‚Äôs it.
"Slept through it, didn't know it happened until this morning"
We‚Äôre out of power till afternoon.
No power since 3am. No estimate for restoration.
"Plastic cover for the Tachus access point blew into the street

EDIT: shit, y‚Äôall, I am sorry. Some of you guys got it bad."
Kinda had my Bluetooth headphones on with ambient ocean waves coming along a beach to block out the thunder noises keeping me up. Did have a brief power outage before everything came back on.
My company lost internet. AT&T says it won‚Äôt be back for 24-48 hours. We are expected to work from home.
"Thunder and lightning. A few smaller branches down, but otherwise my house is fine.

Did discover that we lost a screw on the mailbox though, so the door was open and all the mail from last night's delivery was wet. Not sure if the wind caught it or it was just loose and finally gave up the ghost."
"It was noisy, windy, and rainy, but overall not bad in this area of Near Northside."
Lots of loud lightning/thunder and rain. Everything seems okay
No power at any gas stations in my area and due to high winds I couldn't get gas last night either (power kept flickering). Fingers crossed my lunch break goes better cause I've been on E since yesterday.
All good down here in pearland.
Couple downed branches no damage in seabrook
"Se side near Sagemonte./   Only thing that bothered me was I have a dog that thinks he is a bad ass but a little lightning and he cries like a little whiney bitch and wants to sleep across me. I use brown noise. I wouldnt have known it if it wasnt for my dog  

&#x200B;

Other than that A couple downed small limbs,.   Thats about it."
My sleep was deeply disturbed. Not sure who pissed off Zeus last night but I haven‚Äôt heard thunder and seen lightning like that be so damn intense in a while
"That firestone on Mason is gone... I've gone there for years. 

Parents' house doesn't have power."
Power is still out. Not a fun day.
"Not too bad in Humble, just flickers of power going out. But that storm was strong"
I gained an attic exhaust fan in my backyard.  Still not sure whose house it came off of.
"The fact that my power goes out for hours at a time every time there‚Äôs a storm is bullshit. It‚Äôs several times a year now. It didn‚Äôt use to be that bad at all. And I live on a power feeder that powers a school and a sewage treatment plant. They lose power with me now, too."
I was sleeping so good I didn't even hear it üí§
"I just cleaned my front door and security door now they are dirty again.  The fat squirrel who lives on my porch is still fat.

That is all."
my ladder fell over
"slept through it, no impact at all"
"I am out of town for work, but I was getting alerts non-stop thay there was movement in my house. It was the flashing of the lighting on the walls! Kinda wish I could have been there to see it!"
Rain slapped my windows like a pimp named slick back for a couple hours. We typically lose power to a light breeze but surprisingly all it did was flicker a few times.
There was a storm?
my dog had a full blown meltdown
Did it even rain? We had light rain in the evening but I didn‚Äôt know we had more storms overnight???
The wind took away my kerjiggers!
Collected some water ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏èOur water has been off since last Thursday
Shared fenced fell down
"Lost 1/3 of my fence, and a semi large tree limb."
Not too bad. Took the kids all of 15 minutes to pick and break up all the new twigs and sticks in the yard.
"Had to release what felt like number of gallons of water from my outdoor pond. 

Two clients in cypress lost power into the morning, one of them lost a large battery back up.

One client in Jersey Village was without internet until about an hour ago. Comcast had up to a few thousand reported outages."
Street I live on has old trees. It was trashed this morning. Lots of bumps while driving over limbs. There are still a ton of pinecones in the streets of the neighborhood.
Lightening struck so close to the house that it woke me up at 3am. Happened a few more times and couldn‚Äôt fall back to sleep so I stayed up watching tv. Was at the office 5 hours later downing coffee
"Gotta sat, moved to Ctrl TX from Houston about 4.5 yrs ago.  We don't have crao compared to Houston storms.  But we finally had one wirh z super hard rainfall yesterday.

Miss the  Houston area .  It will soon return to no rainfall here.  Kinda sucks..."
I have nothing. Seriously the dope fiend complex I'm trapped in received no damage and the dope fiends are just still running around like roaches. I hate this area. Fuckin Cleveland Conroe cut and shoot
I died
There was a storm? I guess I did fine then
No power since 3am in parts of Tanglewilde
