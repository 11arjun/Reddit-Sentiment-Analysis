Comment
"I last night created a Google spreadsheet on this very topic for my wife and I that goes over the top 50 US Metro areas by population.  It includes all the population fields from the Wikipedia page on the topic, and I added CoL and expected temperatures. I can share if you would like.  I've not filtered out but did flag cities in Texas, Florida, etc.  (Edit 3: I removed the flag as it seemed to be confusing people and is really my bias.)

Edit: let's try a public link share

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yr4sIjde-ZflSpU-_obfGJo2sazsj6AHcADskTH-tOU/edit?usp=drivesdk

Second Edit:  People can always add additional columns.  Maybe you want to know how many Chinese grocery stores are in the area, or presence of art communities, or distance to the nearest national Park (I see you cheating, St. Louis).  Copy and modify at your leisure!"
Is everyone finding jobs before you move? Or are you just moving and hoping it all works out? I don’t hate the idea of leaving but not sure how it would work financially. Also so much family is here.
Everyone is moving to Denver
I'm leaving from TX to mass. Next week
"I don't get why people are always so hostile towards people wanting to leave Houston. It's not a personal insult. This city can be an acquired taste and I say that as someone who was born and raised here, and has lived other places. Nobody's forcing YOU to move, people are just making their own personal choices and asking for input. The least you could do is be neighborly and kind. If you love it here, nobody's telling you to get out. Some people just don't love it and shockingly, that's ok and valid with everything going on. 

OP, I hope wherever you end up you're happy, because it doesn't seem like you are here and I completely understand that. More power to you, I hope you find a good fit somewhere."
"Ah the Texas poverty trap, so cheap to live that you can't afford to move. I think the only way out is to get a job somewhere else that can cover the inevitably increased expenses."
I relocated to Providence RI for a job post pandemic and I love it up here.
"Give the DMV (DC, Maryland, Virginia) area a go.  It's beautiful 2 seasons out of 4, and not bad during the other 2, lots of great culture/history stuff, outdoors activities, great food (similar in terms of diversity of choices as well) pretty vibrant community of younger professionals but also good for family life, older folks, etc..  I don't know a ton about the cost of living nowadays but I'm thinking its a lot cheaper than NY/SF/Boston and sort of comparable to Houston.  10 years ago it was only a little more expensive to live in Northern Virginia than Houston.  The one catch is it is a patchwork of suburbs unless you want to be somewhere in DC itself.  So there's highway driving.  But that's the same here... at least there the highways are in better shape and you see nicer stuff as you're driving.

As far as disasters, yes, they do have them, but they've done more to weatherize the grid than Houston has."
"Lived most my life in Houston, but I'm done.  Heat, humidity, storms, traffic...all getting unbearable. We are considering Asheville (pop 100K) or Charlotte (pop 1M).  A bit smaller but just seems easier."
"Minnesota. Cost of living isn't crazy. Pretty well insulated from climate change, and winters are getting less intense. Politics aren't insane. We are actively planning a move."
A Chicago suburb. It’s actually not as unaffordable as you’d think and it has that Houston level of diversity and good food. And a lot of people always point to crime in Chicago 1. It’s the same as crime in Houston literally. 2. Once you’re a local you know where to go and where not to go just like in Houston you know not to go to greenspoint at night. I’m thinking of moving there or Long Beach CA but the possibility of owning a home in California is much lower than Illinois
"Moved to SoCal near the coast. I'm not going to lie, breaking out of Houston and trying to purchase a house here will cost you everything. Not only did we sell our house in Houston but had to sell everything in it too. You get what you pay for however."
"Michigan. Detroit has a reputation but nowadays it is honestly a pretty great city that isn't super expensive, especially depending on area. Summers are obviously nothing compared to Houston, politics are generally pretty sane, cheapest weed in the country, no huge natural disasters except snow and ice storms but the recovery from those pales in comparison to what you guys are going through. Genuinely feel the state as a whole is very overlooked"
I moved to Wisconsin a year ago and couldn't be happier.
"I was talking to a friend last night who is also working on moving from Houston.  One of her options was Charlotte, which I think is a good one.  My sister lives there and it's a great place to live."
"Look at places like New Mexico, Illinois (not necessarily Chicago), Pennsylvania, or the area between NY and Maine. It's not always going to be the places you first think of, but if you really do a deep dive, you'll find the kind of place.youre looking for."

"Oaxaca, Mexico.  18th months till I retire and we've found our next home.  adios amigos."
"I live in San Francisco and I hate it. The passive aggressive culture in San Francisco gets way worse the more north you go. Seattle just feels so depressing tbh 

I always recommend OC or San Diego because of the sun, and I love Boston as well. Not any less cheap, but I feel like my tax dollars go further there than in Texas, but YMMV"
"I just moved to Bellingham Washington. Guys, it's basically Narnia. It's beautiful, walkable, and the high today is going to be °78. I couldn't take another summer in Houston"
"We looked at Olympia as a city.  It’s much cheaper than Seattle but close enough to enjoy the city.  

Not all parts of Colorado are expensive.  Visit a few places and you’ll see.

Also, try Connecticut or Raleigh.  The East coast is a different lifestyle, though.  Less land, more townhomes."
Planning on Detroit suburbs. It's insane people are sleeping on this area.
"Columbus OH. Big city, small town feel. 2 hours from Lake Erie. 2 hours to mountains in West Virginia. Good cost of living. Diverse economy. Diverse population. Lots of jobs. Excellent college in Ohio State University. Far enough from Houston to really experience a different part of USA."
"I have friends moving to Colorado this year but they are remote so they don't have to worry about living in the big cities.

I've considered the PNW area since it's beautiful and there are lots of natural areas but my coworkers who live there tell me they get seasonal depression every winter because the sun sets so early. The Midwest around Chicago has always seemed too cold for me in winter but I'm not entirely ruling it out now.

I've thought about New Mexico around the Santa Fe area and plan to take some road trips to that area later this year to check it out."
"Atlanta, Nashville, Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, Athens GA, Asheville NC, Sacramento, Boulder, Denver."

"We're aiming to be out of Texas by 2026 and we've narrowed it down to either Denver, Colorado or Richmond, Virginia.

My wife and I both have a huge love for the great outdoors, so obviously Denver is incredibly appealing in that aspect. If you live anywhere west of 25, you're a maximum of 15-20 minutes from a huge number of beautiful hiking trails. Biggest drawback is that cost of living in Denver is high (mostly housing costs, almost everything else seems to cost close to the same as Houston) and a lot of people are moving there (though many are also leaving).

But we also really loved the culture and vibe of Richmond when we visited. It reminded me of if you took Montrose and turned it into an entire city instead of just a neighborhood. Richmond is about 1.5 hours from the Appalachians and about 2 hours from the Atlantic. So you've got relatively easy access to mountains or beaches. Cost of living is slightly higher than Houston, though not by too much. But there is also the risk of hurricanes there, albeit not as bad as Houston. For now, anyway.

It's a hard choice to make, but we know we'd be happy in either place."
Illinois good public services and blue state
"If you have a uterus, go somewhere that will actually care for you."
I want to go to Minnesota (Twin cities) or Upstate New York (Syracuse) my wife loves outdoor ice skating. I WFH so it's possible. But I need to wait until my 1 year old gets into public school. We can't afford daycare And are relying on retired grandmothers for help at the moment.
"I moved to Humboldt County CA. Redwoods, ocean, and temperate climate.  I have worn sleeves all week. Had to turn on the heater 3 days ago because it got so cold overnight and we had left windows open, it was 60 in the house.  It's in the middle of nowhere, though. 


Not easily accessed for travel and limited purchasing options. Forget same-day Amazon delivery...."
Spouse wants to go to Pittsburg.  I want an interdimensional portal to a functional Houston and Texas.
Kansas City! Deeply underrated city that's growing like crazy right now
"I've never even considered it before this week, but I'm starting to think about what that could look like. A few years ago a friend of mine moved to Minneapolis, and I realized it's kind of this bizarro version of Houston: often dismissed for bad weather, punches above its weight economically and culturally, is growing but still affordable. One of my favorite things about Houston is how its bad reputation filters out a lot of people who just want to live somewhere cool, and I imagine Minnesota has a similar filter. Plus their state and local politics seem to have a very ""pragmatic progressive"" vibe, which I dig."
"Move to Virginia outside of the DC area. We were in Richmond Virginia and absolutely loved it. Food scene is surprisingly good, the cost of living isnt insane, theres a decent sized airport, Shenandoah natl. park is 2 hrs away, the beach is 2 hrs away. You get all 4 seasons, no threat of major natural disasters, diverse enough to where you can find a few people of your tribe. Theres kayaking and white water rafting in the city itself. Big hospital system in the city, employment is decent for a city its size.

Honestly its a hidden gem."
Considering PNW or New England.
"Portland Oregon is where I moved from Houston in 2019 and I have never regretted it for a second (well... except for the heat dome). Depending on if you're renting or not, I've found the price to be essetially the same if you're willing to live with roommates"
New Mexico
"As someone who has lived in Denver / Boulder for the better half of the last 12 years with a few years in Austin/ SF as well (( I’m originally from greater HTX))….Denver is the most expensive, I would say it’s neck and neck with SF on most things but the pay is significantly less. Not sure what your job is, but as someone who works in healthcare- SF nurses typically make / start at 2-3 x as much as CO nurses & this significant pay difference seems to affect the majority of professions amongst the 2 cities. Cost of living in Denver is high, you’ll need a ‘newer’ car for the snow/ winters (which can be brutal and expensive). Rent is high in Denver, prices of homes are outrageous, food/ grocery/ tax is high here (so if you need a new car, don’t get one here!) if you can afford it, it’s an okay city. It lacks diversity, good food, a downtown, high paying jobs, natural beautiful scenery within the actual city (you can drive an hour + (without traffic)  to some mountains, but you are not close) Also, if you are coming from Texas- you will see people are not ‘community’ focused neighbors here…people are very independent of one another (like SF) which is fine, but it will be a culture shock coming from Texas. This is just my opinion! You may love it. These are just things to keep in mind. Best of luck to you and your move. Choose somewhere that meets your needs!"
OUT OF THE USA!
"I moved to Houston to gtfo of Ohio…. and after all the flooding events and then Harvey and then the pandemic and then the freeze and then being in TWO cones of uncertainty at once  in 2020 with a newborn… I finally lost it and moved back to Ohio. But a much better part of Ohio than where I came from. 

If you’re in tech or healthcare, Columbus is not a bad area to be, but man is housing insane here right now. But the winters are mild and we don’t have hurricanes either."
[deleted]
I’m moving back to the beach in New Haven CT as soon as our house sells…. I tried here for 3 years. I’m done.
Pittsburgh
I’ve heard the schools in Colorado have libraries.
"Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Milwaukee? :/"
"Las Vegas suburbs, like Henderson or Summerlin they have some really nice suburbs and while the cost of living is higher than here, it’s not as bad as the West coast."
"I have family in Pittsburgh and Reno. Neither seemed like viable places, but honestly now both of them do. 

I have cousins in Knoxville, but you’d be stuck with a similarly shitty political landscape. 

Gonna follow this thread for ideas."
Omaha
Find a good job. Move there. Live simply. Save a ton of money in your emergency fund so you have a lot more flexibility in the future.
Pittsburgh. Relatively affordable and in a more purple state. Near the mountains and the east coast.
"Moved a few years ago exactly for the reasons you stated to the Pacific Northwest, specifically tacoma, 45 min outside of  Seattle . Sure the housing is a lot more expensive but more affordable than seattle. The  weather, economy and healthcare is much better. I do miss sometimes the heat and food from Houston but every time I go back to visit, i get a reminder why I left. There are things here that I don’t like as well but the positives outweigh the negatives ( housing cost, food options, rainy season)."
"Colorado is the fackin best. There’s a reason so many Texans are out there.

I moved from Denver to Austin recently. Just moved back to Denver and this weekend alone made me realize where I need to be"
Go where you can get a job.
"Pittsburgh! Everyone thinks it’s crazy but I’m in mixed marriage (B/W) and it’s better than many places for diversity, lots of rich folks left amazing museums, parks, universities, cost is not too high, climate disaster protected by Appalachias, overall cool rejuvenation feeling ( reviving  industrial city). 
Just dint know if it’s mainly blue or red. Then the episode last weekend so….. not sure. But I’d check it out."
"This is going to sound crazy but have you thought of the Kansas City area, it’s really boring but it does offer a calm affordable lifestyle."
We moved back to Michigan 🤷
"South Delaware isn't so bad.

We happen to have shared ownership of a property there and it seems the most reasonable location if such a move need be made."
"Colorado here. People have been moving here en masse since weed was legalized, and it got worse after everyone started working from home and no longer have an office cubicle post-covid. It's not just Denver, folks are targeting the smaller cities, and in 2023 the fastest growing city in CO per capita was Fort Collins. Demand has slowed slightly in the past year, but not by much. So many people have moved to CO from TX that it has become its own meme, and generally, people from TX are welcome now like a tourist from Dallas who went to Galveston days after Beryl hit and complained that everything was closed. Big pavement princess trucks that parked like a jerk? Bet it has TX plates (and odds are it will). A single-car wreck like driving down a two-story concrete staircase? TX plates? Probably. That's the expectation, anyway. Competition for real estate is tough, but not impossible, and the prices have done nothing but go up.

The roads and streets are also in horrible condition. CO is one of the most tax-rich states in the country, it has weed tax, tourism tax (general tourists, skiing, hunting, hiking, kayaking, rock climbing, etc), a decades-long yearly influx of new tax payers, the lottery (no idea if any of that money goes to the roads) and yet the streets and interstates totally suck.

You could probably find similar cities like Ashville, NC, or Eugene, OR, that don't have quite the same level of competition for real estate and much better roads."
"Yep. Emigrating to Canada at the end of the year. Started the process in 2016, finally approved earlier this year (covid mucked up the process). Def not cheap tho."
Colorado is affordable for upper middle class.
Looking at Greensboro or Winston-Salem NC and at Pittsburgh.
"I don’t know what the prevalent opinion on Philly is (I’m sure not great) but I visited early summer and I fell in LOVE. I was in University City but man just how easy it was to get around was amazing. First time I ever used public transportation which included the bus, tram, and subway. Buddy was like “hey man let’s go some Ethiopian” and 7-9 min walk later we’re there. Quick 15 min bus ride and I’m at love park. 20 min tram ride and we’re at a jazz show.

Also the few people I interacted with were so lovely. We went to my buddy’s house in south Philly (doesn’t live there yet) and his neighbor came and a greeted us both times. Welcomed us to the neighborhood.

Got me really thinking. Man my dog and I could be happy here. I gave myself a goal to spend at least a year there. Hopefully in a year or two."
"PNW all day. 

Denver is too crowded and getting worse by the day."
I was looking at Nova Scotia. Had previously considered Costa Rica.
"Try Rhode Island -it's like Massachusetts lite. Great public education, lots of beaches, mix of political beliefs, and lots of areas where the typical American Dream is still within reach (at least for now). Providence is a small city but we aren't too far from Boston for a night out. There are also tons of little beach towns that are great to enjoy with family."
"My husband and I are laying the groundwork to be in California by this time next year. Yes it will be expensive, but it’s better weather, better quality of life and far more politically compatible with our beliefs than Texas. I’ve lived in the Houston/Galveston area for 39 years, and I’m just done."
I left Texas for Colorado this time last year. Best decision I ever made.
"I have family in Fayetteville, Arkansas and every time I go up to visit I always think to myself damn I could totally live here. Beautiful scenery, there's plenty of stuff to do, and Branson, Missouri is less than 2 hours away. Only thing I could see being an issue is possibly the job market I'm not sure how it is up there but my uncle makes 6 figures and they live in a huge brand-new house that would probably cost a fortune down here."
Thinking about moving to the heights.
The downsides of living in a LCOL area with a healthy job market…
it seems so difficult to move out of Texas on a low income since basically every other state worth moving to is much more expensive
Michigan beckons.  Endless fresh water.
"My wife and I moved to Southern Colorado a few years back and haven't looked back since. We found out later that Texans are moving here in mass apparently (whatever). I will say that it is a bit more expensive than houston, but not much. I would only suggest having a job lined up before you move if you're not remote."
"Check out the Tri cities area in Washington state.

It’s in the eastern part of the state situated along the Yakima, Snake, and Columbia rivers.

You’re a few hours from Seattle and Portland and 300 sunshine days a year. You’ll get hot temps but without the humidity as the area is in the rain shadow of the cascades.

Outside of the US, check out southern Spain. Cost of living is cheap. You can live a rich fulfilling life on $35k/year with walkable cities and a warm culture."
"I’m looking at Philadelphia, Washington state and Colorado. I honestly don’t care much outside of it has to be a blue state."
"Charlotte , NC"
Minnesota
Look into the Twin Cities.
"Battle Creek, Michigan I heard is the place to go."
west coasy
"Consider North Carolina.  I lived in Dallas for 35 years and was so proud to live in such a vibrant city.  But after moving to near Asheville, I discovered a really nice climate and culture.  I don't think I'd ever move back."
I moved to Phoenix. If you can get through the summers it’s great.
"Grew up in the Houston area but will likely move in 1-1.5 years. Wife and I are looking at NoVa, northwest of IAD airport towards West Virginia. Thought about Colorado (like everyone else from Texas)."
"I have family in KC (some on both MO and KS side) and I always enjoy it when I visit and they are happy there!

I also have a cousin in Indianapolis that loves it.

I chose the PNW when leaving Houston last year after realizing I was not happy in TX anymore for several reasons."
Virginia
"North or South Carolina but they are still prone to hurricanes but you won’t be without power for a week when one hits. Northern California, Orange County. PNW  has many great cities and stuff for everyone to do. Maine, upstate New York, Boston is pretty nice. All depends on what you like and want to do. Colorado is nice but I think there are many better options out there. And honestly the food is not all that here, cities in all these other named states have good food and their own type of food. I work in travel hospitality and have loved many of the cities I have traveled to."
Any recommendations for a hippie town?
Thank you for this post! I thought about Chicago or Los Angeles
I moved to Denver from Houston a little over 2 years ago and don’t regret it. I feel like cost of living is fairly comparable and there are so many rental units coming online here that the rents should go down. We also have a reliable power grid and quick access to the mountains.
"Go to the Great Lakes area. Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo, Toronto, etc.

Probably insulated from most insane weather, plenty of economic activity. Plentiful water, even as time goes on."
I moved to Chicago and I fucking love it.
"Charlotte, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, also around Denver. You have tons of options. With insurance and property taxes, Houston gets kind of pricey. Wasn’t worth it to me. No offense to those that like it."
I'm thinking Colorado
Colorado Springs. Such an amazing little city with fantastic weather and close proximity to Denver. I would be there so fast if my current work was there too.
Chicago is really nice. If you can find a nice job there they have public transport. Roads are nice. And there are so many opportunities and businesses there
Denver for me
Anywhere that you can go to the mailbox and not come back wet would be nice.
"Red states are cheaper for a reason, thats how it is. You get what you pay for"
I’m staying.
I leave Friday.  Arizona.
Adios
"I'm looking into the deserts maybe New Mexico. I know I can handle heat and if you get rid of the humidity and cool it off when I am sleeping sounds fucking perfect. Not a lot of rain to fuck up my detail jobs on my truck, I can have rocks and cacti as my lawn and never mow.

Oh and I can finally have my grow shed!!!!

I am ready to buy a piece of desert, put a trailer on it and live like Budd in Kill Bill."
"Idk I lived in austin and San Diego before houston and I’m the happiest I’ve ever been

San Diego is my favorite city and I’ll move back, but San Diego has a terrible job market. It wasn’t worth it to be broke out there for me

Austin was fun, but it’s pretty granola and over priced and over crowded. Also I love to surf so spending 5 years in austin I felt like a fish out of water

Overall I love houston. It’s cheap, the jobs here are good and pay well, I can still surf occasionally in Galveston, we have a great music scene, but I guarantee you that you won’t find more down to earth people in any large city like you will in Houston"
"All the civilized places in the US are expensive to match. Truthfully, sensible people should stop fleeing dysfunctional cities and put in some effort into fixing things up but I understand it's not that easy. 

I'm personally looking at just leaving the US eventually. A lot of us will have to in order to retire anyway."
We are going to live in poverty near San francisco
"I know that the state’s political apparatus doesn’t exactly align, but Tulsa has affordable housing and a funky art scene. They also have medical marijuana if that’s a plus. Cards are easy to acquire and they have seasons up there. They can also handle icy conditions."
Let’s all move to Vegas
Somewhere in the Northeast is the plan for the moment.
Chattanooga
All those cities in the northeast and midwest that everyone has been leaving for decades?
"Try Anchorage, AK. Mid-sized city. Good food. Medium cost of living. It's sort of purple state. The conservatives are more of the libertarian or corporate whore variety than culture war jesus freak variety. Lots and lots of outdoor stuff to do if you're into it. Definitely doesn't have hot weather. Traffic is no where near as bad as Houston either."
"We moved to H-town for my happiness almost 7 years ago (3 days before Harvey!), bought a house 5 years ago to live in until the unborn kid got out of college, and we are going the fuck back to NJ next summer after the kid finishes their kindergarten Montessori loop. I’m so sad to leave the weather, food (best vegan scene!!), breweries and cost of living, but it’s just not worth it. 

If my wife wasn’t from NJ and her family was still up there, we’d probably go get a beach shack in Cali. At this point, I am happy to pay taxes for infrastructure and rights."
Vegas probably
Never thought Texas was bad until I started to break my alt-right conditioning a few years ago... But I'm unfortunately too stupid to go anywhere else but a trade. (No Uni degree)
Portland oregon seems to have their shit together and they care about quality of life.
"I’m just dropping this suggestion into every convo in which it is relevant:

If you are a blue voter considering moving out of a red state, don’t move to a blue state; move to a swing state. You will be instantly much more powerful in at least a few ways."
I've looked at central Washington and it looked good.  My wife and I are looking at Mexico and South Africa amongst other places.
"I'm looking at Omaha, personally. 
I really like the music community there."
"I'm originally from central Texas; have lived in Chicago, Boston, and now Madison. I'm becoming fond of the upper midwest in particular. Might consider Minneapolis next time I'm doing a job hunt."
San Antonio is nice!
I’m actually considering Dallas as a potential destination or possibly moving out of state either Florida or South Carolina
Good luck
Following this because we want to move too… it’s just difficult with a big family.
Cleveland welcomes you!
Minnesota or Iowa
"I'm entertaining a job offer in South Carolina right now, apparently it's lovely."
"I'm moving to Austin.

Minnesota. 

Moving for love and seasons, but will likely pick a more populous city in MN once I'm there for a bit and can see more of the state."
maine looks pretty good. its so cheap that you can get a winter home down south somewhere.
Best friends stepbrother is probably moving to Colorado. It's nice if you can float/afford it.
"PNW is the best. The real estate is hella high, gas is high. But compared to Houston, the real estate tax is a lot less. Same with insurance.
No sales tax on food (non precooked).
And the surrounding scenery is absolutely unbeatable on this country. For non taxed sales, head to Portland once a year to do your big shopping."
Looked at the prices of homes outside of Texas and thought better of it lol. NC is the closest I've seen other than Florida. I'm still leaning towards staying. Btw it's funny how this is becoming a popular sentiment now but I've had this sentiment for a while now and now I'm just considering staying while everyone else is considering now leaving.
"Currently live in Austin—going to Chicago this week until mid-October. Inexpensive COL, greats summers and 3rd largest US city. Can’t stand a winter there though. Next year I’m considering Portland or Seattle as my move out of Texas."
Decided to leave without a plan lol
"I would leave so fast if my family would go for it. My husband and son are die hard Texans. Also, my son/dil have my granddaughter and I would never leave her."
"Philadelphia and it's suburbs. You will find a very good food scene, and the CoL is pretty close to Houston. Philly is a big city, and had crime problems,  but there's a lot of nice areas. Beautiful rolling land. NYC is 90 minutes away, the Jersey shore is day-tripable, and you have the Poconos for hiking. Four seasons. Winter lasts until March though."
"I will always love Texas as its home, especially the Htown area but Reno NV has been a strange calm haven. It’s like Austin used to be before half of CA moved here. Funny enough people complain about CA people moving here."
"Pittsburgh is the best! If you’re blue, come on through! 😉"
"Charlotte, NC"
I’ve got my eye on New Mexico
"Personal Recs from about 20 years of living/moving- Chicago (hometown), Durham, NC- Sacramento,CA- Casper, WY- Gilbert or Scottsdale, AZ"
"If you don't mind severe cold, the midwest might tick your boxes. We're shopping for a place where NONE of the seasons are trying to kill us, though."
"OP, if you figure out let me know, I want to get my family the hell out of here too."
"I lived in Vermont for a little bit, in Burlington. It was nice and the people were pretty cool. Very cold and lots of snow tho. And I think you have to get a dog and a Subaru…"
"Bellingham, WA"
I moved to New Mexico
"My sister moved to Connecticut.  Eastern Connecticut (the part not part of the NYC metro areas) has a number of small cities where the CoL is just marginally higher than Houston.  Same goes for much of non-NYC, non-Boston New England.  State-level politics are blue, local politics are usually mixed, winters have gotten significantly warmer, overall climate is chilly, and the food sucks unless you like lobster."
"I'm currently looking into Colorado and Montana. I've lived in CO before and loved it. I work from home, so I can pretty much go anywhere that I can afford. Also avoiding cities. I'm trying to find something much more rural. I plan on leaving this fall."
"I teach and my husband’s job has offices all over the US so we have discussed moving too. We’re torn between Denver, Portland, and Chicago. Personally I’d rather live in Portland, but we have a lot of friends who work remote that are going to Colorado. 

It just gets hard when we own a home, have lots of family here, want to start a family, etc. I feel like if we wait much longer it’ll be too difficult to move."
"I can not tolerate it here any longer. We were spared the hurricane as we are in central Texas, but I'm slowly losing myself here. It's hot, ugly, dangerous, crap politics and the cheapness in which my house was built shows. I'm hoping to move to the PNW. it's expensive, but honestly, I don't want to waste my life being here.  I feel your pain."
"Flee to the Cle. 

Seriously it’s awesome and cheap."
If you can deal with equally miserable but different summers I would suggest Arizona. On the positive side the winters are perfect and there’s no natural disasters or artic blasts. The cost of living is comparable to Houston overall and there’s no humidity and SoCal is only about a 5.5 hour drive away.
"Im a born and raised Texan and I always really enjoyed the northern midwest. Chicago, Madison, Milwaukee… It’s so cozy and the fall seasons are truly to die for. Snow is brutal but it’s still beautiful. Would not recommend central midwest under any circumstances though, it’s worse than Tx. Michigan and Vermont are beautiful as well."
The Great Lakes Region is really the only region of the soon to be fascists states of America.  If you think loosing power is bad?  Think running out of water.
I wish you luck.
"Anybody thought about Pittsburgh? Low cost of living, very green and with some actual elevation. kind of a hidden gem in my opinion"
"I was thinking upstate New York. Syracuse or Rochester, maybe."
Upstate NY or Buffalo
"Come to Maryland! We have women's rights, unionized municipal employees (including teachers), incredible healthcare, and almost no severe weather. You can visit NYC, DC, the ocean, or the Appalachian mountains all within less than half days drive. 

Suburbs around DC are stupid expensive but everywhere else is just regular expensive."
"Moved to NYC a year ago, went back to Houston in July, regretted it and came back. The recent hurricane just made me remember why I left in the first place."
Dallas is great
I've been looking at New Mexico and Denver
"I wish there is a city that build like Tokyo, also cheap food prices"
MICHIGAN!
I’m actually jealous of your honesty and bravery
"Check out Omaha, NE. It’s 8hr drive to Denver, Chicago, Minneapolis along with other places. It’s no Houston but there’s a lot to do there."
Buffalo NY has a similar cost of living.
"Your challenge is finding a ""blue"" state that isn't expensive.  Sounds like your choices are Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Detroit or Pittsburgh, though i would consider Wisconsin and Pennsylvania ""purple""."
"It evens out if you think about it.  No money spent on dealing with weeks without power, a lot of more free stuff to do, less money spent on gas, food seems to be cheaper or relatively the same anywhere in the US, less insurance, less stress induced damage, and etc.  Use your head and quit letting the “NO STATE INCOME RAX” rule your brain."
Move to Los Angeles 😂😂
Phoenix? Dry heat but no flooding or hurricanes
"I mean if youre asking if it was me, I'd move to Atlanta, but I like the heat.

Youre relatively safe from natural disasters, still in a good sized city, somewhat diverse (nothing is like Htown for that) choice of suburb/urban/semirural options, and the politics are a little better if still challenging.

Just for whatever its worth."
"I might just go back to Illinois. If I can find a job in my field, I would. Maybe not Chicago, though. I know it would be better in terms of infrastructure, but it's still a big city. I need a break from city life in general."
Honestly thinking about moving to Chicago to still have diversity and good food scene and have a home state with saner politics.
"A lot of folk will comment on the higher cost of living and that's fair but also what's the point of living in a low cost of living place where the city infrastructure is failing, the natural disasters and weather are getting progressively worse (not that anywhere is fully immune to that), the built environment is toxic, and the state government is slowly taking over the city?"
"Bruhh Denver is insane homelessness, everything is expensive as hell lol … let me know if you find a alternative"
I was looking at Naperville outside Chi… then they got a derecho last night 😂🥴
Wife and I are planning our exidous in the next few years down to Guadalajara. Either Zappopan or find something in the Chapala/Ajijic area. We absolutely love it down there and have family in the area so it's basically home already
Looks like a bunch of people are leaving. Good!  Maybe housing prices will settle down a bit in Houston. Leave us to our trash.
Tennessee is BEAUTIFUL.  Lakes and rivers and creeks everywhere.
The cost of living is going to get you. The ones that are similar in price also deal with their own type of weather. Don't forget you aren't just dealing with higher cost of living but also state income tax. I tried to move back to the North East (grew up in TX was in NYC for 13 years then back to TX) and the salaries were about the same as I have in Houston and you then have to pay income tax. Then the houses cost double what they do here. Gas was almost a dollar more a gallon. We just decided to stay in TX and make the best of it.
"I'm currently living in NY for work, wife is back home in Spring with our dogs and home we bought in 2021. Looking to relocate to Colorado Springs soon. The wife was not happy with the prospect of living in NY, but COS sounds very lucrative for us."
I’m considering Colorado
We are moving to Albany next summer
i swear everybody from tx moving to colorado
Chicago or Minneapolis would be my choice. I like the cold and WFH so ….
"Honestly guys another comment said it but with the Texas poverty trap your buying power WILL go down. No matter where you go, unless you make over 200K.. (but then at point you can buy solar panels for your house lol and vacation when disasters strike)"
Chicago.
"Coming from Houston, Colorado’s lack of diversity is going to be shocking. You’ll also miss good food. I would definitely pick a place where you can find both of those bc I think you’ll miss them"
"You don’t sound like you’re from here, since you don’t even know “whatever Texas is good at”.  Are there no conversations to be had?  Do we have to make up fake stuff to get the ball rolling?"
Bye bye.
r/SameGrassButGreener
If you’re having a bad time in Houston you’re gonna have a bad time in any other medium to large sized city
Bye. Where are you going to go? East coast?  Hurricanes. Up north?  Cold winters and potential blizzards. Mid-West?  Tornadoes. Cali?  Good luck and you may fall into the ocean one day. AZ? Desert and oppressive heat. So where do you want to go?
"Were you not aware of the heat, hurricanes, or politics before you moved?"
"Raton, NM looked really nice but I was just driving through."

[deleted]
How does Montana look?
Just move to Charleston or Savannah
Chattanooga!!!
So many houses gonna be for sale in Houston that it will be so affordable that people will second guess their decision...🤣
I’ve always been interested in the SE coast
Idaho or Utah are good examples. Colorado is still okay. WA or OR is same as California.
Kansas City?
Check out Georgia or the Carolinas either.
Is Minnesota any better? I hear good things about Minneapolis 👀
I’m sooooo sick of the heat!! Husband wants to stay but if up to me we’re out a here!
Family is considering Connecticut and will be traveling to see homes.
We are thinking New Mexico.
That’s the dilemma and why we are all still here!!! 😫
"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania?"
"I’m trying to get my fiancé on board with Louisville. Considered a red state but currently has a Democratic Governor. Medium sized, four hour drive from a bunch of other places, four seasons. After growing up in Houston, living in San Francisco for a decade, and now being back in Houston for a few years, I’m just looking for something reasonable across the board. I’m too old for all this nonsense."
Charolette would be my pick.
"It’s a little hot right now, but Maryland is wonderful and the heat won’t last too much longer!"
The Philly suburbs are great.
I am moving to Pennsylvania .
I have family in Boston. I’m going to Boston.
"I'm ready to go I had to move to league city for a while, cuz the prices were just getting two out of control in Houston"
i would if i could afford to
"We left for Buffalo several years ago, and have had no regrets. Other Texas family members with kids followed a year later, and just in the last few months friends of ours from Houston purchased a home here for use in the summers. Snow and cold weather may scare some people away, but at least here the winters are not brutal cold like the midwest, and the city knows how to deal with winter extremes. Summers are a blast as the city comes alive with people out and about, 90s are rare, and never a 100 degree day in history (so far, fingers crossed). Buffalo is a small big city, over 1M+ people plus proximity to larger cities like Toronto, along with climate and terrain not to be found anywhere in Texas. If you love old and often historic housing types like in the Heights, Buffalo has thousands of well-maintained homes in walkable neighborhoods all over the city (and some suburbs) for lower prices, lower out-of-pocket taxes, and way lower insurance costs than in Houston. Especially for people who can work remotely, and want to live in an affordable and walkable old neighborhood, Buffalo is a great bargain and location. As a smaller city, the employment and pay situation is dependent on your job and experience, but low-wage jobs have a higher starting point in NY than in Texas. 

For those concerned about snow/sun/clouds/rain, Buffalo climate is similar to the PNW but cooler with snow in the winters (with intermittent periods of warmth and dryness), and without the occasional summer extremes (no 100s). There is plentiful water-based activities in the warm months (beaches, lakes, fishing, boating, etc), and snow-based activities in the winters (local skiing, sledding, skating, etc)."
Maryland
"I moved to Oregon, Willamette Valley, in April and I love it!!"
Moved to Portland 8 years ago and never looked back.      I do miss kolaches tho
California is great.  I liked San Mateo.  Portland Oregon.  Seattle Washington.  No air conditioning required in any of those spots.  Avoid Redding CA or any of those interior cities.  Really hot in the Summer.
"Nashville is better than houston in every way. I have lived in sacramento, denver, nashville, and now houston

I know TN doesn't meet your criteria, but you could consider there or atlanta, georgia is purple anyway"
"Many parts in Oregon, just outside of the Portland metro area, are more affordable."
It depends on where you are in the PNW.  Some areas aren’t bad.
"Charlotte, NC -- that's where I'm headed once I get a fully WFH job :)"
"I realize this is out of the blue, but I keep hearing good things about Pittsburgh and Milwaukee. I also like Richmond and NOVA but it’s $ there too (NOVA)."
Oh. Also consider areas outside of Philly and northwest of DC.
Kinda slept on but i know a few of my friends and family who’ve moved to either okc or Tulsa and love it and save a lot of money living there
What industry do you work?
Appalachia
"Troy New York, if you're OK the snow!"
Check out Pittsburgh.
"I've decided that I need a generator or I need to leave. No other option. I think we are getting the generator but if we weren't I think I decided on Wauwatosa Wisconsin. The people are friendly, the food is comfort food but pretty good, the service at all the restaurants we went to was good, the weather is nice, it doesn't get as cold as it used to, there's Door county and the Dells, plenty of lakes for swimming. My husband was born there and still has family there. We go 2-3 times per year to visit, but I wouldn't want to live where his family does. It's too small, backwoods"
"Tennessee, Arkansas, the Carolinas"
"I’ve been struggling with this, too. I travel for work though and get to experience a lot of cities, so you think I would have decided where else to go besides here by now.

This sounds weird, but I like Pittsburgh when I’m there because of the greenery and environmental scenery of the rivers/trees/mountains. I can’t relocate there for work though, so haven’t looked into cost of living much."
I moved to Florida. Yes still hurricane prone but irs near my family. Tired of the constant weather emergencies. Moved in April.
"Northwest Arkansas. Foothills of the Ozarks/Bostons .Fiber optic, public water, lots of land. Seasons, but not extreme ones. Same shenanigans in state government, but we've got a chance (again, shenanigans in state government) at getting abortion on the ballot; if we don't, I'm comforted that care is four hours away in Kansas instead of days/a flight away. Legal weed in Missouri, and you can live there/commute if you find a job in Bella Vista or one of the more northern small towns around Fayetteville. 

Cons: harder to find healthcare in general (I took forgranted Houston's proximity to incredible hospitals) and no Costco. Education suffers in poorer areas just like Texas though it seems."
Here to follow the thread. Feeling exactly the same
"Colorado is supposed to be pricey. I was looking this up a bit ago. One affordable place that I found that was liberal, even if the state/rural area isn't, is cincinnati. Cost of living compared to move of the liberal areas on the east cost was much better in Cincinnati.

If you have a semi decent job you can travel with, makemymove.com works with cities that will pay you (I think usually 2 to 5k) to move there. I applied and was approved for northern Indiana where I grew up."
I’m thinking New England. Anyone have a particular state or location to recommend?
Nashville for me
"Friends of ours moved to North Carolina. Good medical centers, not as hot as Houston, state is more purple than red."
Just move to Montgomery. Nothing ever happens there.
Tucson?
Check out Cincy. It’s actually a pretty cool little city and the weather is soooo much better!
"I'm in Ohio, but if I could ... Michigan."
"If you want cheap, go to Ohio. But get ready to be miserable during the long and cold winter months"
"The wonderful city of Solla Sollew, where they never have troubles, at least very few."
"NYC (only for a few years-partially career motivated), North Atlanta, San Diego, Philly suburbs, Charlotte, Chicago (winters are an issue), Orange County (housing mostly unaffordable unless you’re willing to supercommute (1hr+)), Raleigh, DC, Denver. That’s my current priority list excluding TX if I were to move. 

Long term goal is to claim EU citizenship and move there in about a decade or so. Likely central/southern Europe though due to work chances are I’ll end up in London."
I’ve been visiting and really considering Scottsdale AZ
Detroit.
"The middle states. Kansas, Utah, Arkansas, Tennessee."
"Tbh we have been looking at Chicago. Like affordable NYC and the COL is low given all the amenities. You’ll keep all the food options and has such amazing history.

I think if you want similar to Texas the Research Triangle is great. South and North Carolina are a bit better ran than Texas. 

Check out CityNerd on YouTube, he breaks a lot down. His video on Houston is great too."
"Lived in Atlanta for 8 years. Weather is beautiful, it's a big city but not overcrowded and lots of nature too. Definitely less expensive than other big cities.

I also noticed the Lancaster, PA area, it's within reach of 5 major cities"
It depends on what you’re into. Personally I might scurry to New Mexico or Utah.
"Omaha Nebraska isn’t a bad place. A lot more chill…cold in the winter…nice in spring, summer, fall. People are more relaxed, more kind, and easy going. Easy to fly out of if you wanted to take trips. 

North Carolina is very beautiful if you want mountains, sea and all that."
St. Louis needs you. Defend the Lou
Pittsburgh
"Chicago is quite nice and, while more expensive than Houston, still has a lower cost of living than many other large cities. It has beautiful architecture and parks, is quite diverse (albeit segregated), and easy access to nature (particularly in Wisconsin and Michigan). Tons of world-class museums, cultural amenities (top-notch symphony, opera, ballet, and music/arts scenes), and great food too."
im going to philly or back to manhattan. Im lucky I have family to help me and not that much to bring
I would look at states that have no state tax. Like Tennessee or Delaware.
I’ve legit been contemplating moving to Virginia… someone told me West Virginia is inexpensive and beautiful.
"Some of us came with family and didn't really have much of a choice.

If I stay in-state, I'm thinking Dallas. It's at least a bit further north and their transit system is surprisingly really good. They're putting in new rail and have more miles than we do already instead of having their mayor cabal cancel voted on projects left and right like ours is.

If I go out of state though, there's a few options. Midwest areas like Cincy or Indy, New Mexico with family, or maybe a college town somewhere. I feel like college towns would be a good option if you don't work a specific industry style job as they have more robust transit and are more dense by design. Or fuck it maybe Florida, I'm sure their politics and weather are even worse but if I'm gonna go out blazing in a coke fueled bender then what better place than Miami 😂"
"My suggestions: Charlotte, Milwaukee, Omaha, Raleigh, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh."
"We just moved from the Denver area to Houston suburbs. With all the people that have moved in, traffic, worst roads and home prices skyrocketing our insurance and taxes made it unaffordable. 
Compare 700,000 for a ranch style house small lot. To here new build one acre  480,000"
Go to Oregon
Habibi come to Greece
*waving bye* I’ve been other places you have to take the good with the bad. If there was one place that it was the best to live it would already be over crowded.
"A friend of mine moved to Minneapolis from Houston and apparently, it’s a pretty great city with strong social programs. I visited last year and it’s beautiful! I’m stuck in Texas until retirement but am seriously considering moving away from the Houston metro after this storm and the disastrous recovery."
"There is a reason why Houston is cheap and the cities you’d rather live in aren’t. If you want to move to a more livable/favorable place you are going to have to give on price/location/size. 

We live in Atlanta now, it’s similar to Houston but much prettier and the weather is much, much better. But also considering a move to NW WA."
O  my
Moved to Chicago from Houston and love it!
Yall need to travel more.  Everywhere is screwed up right now.
I wanna leave this place ASAP and I have decided to move back to NYC.
"San Diego, CA if you can afford it. Heaven on earth."
"Maybe go to those subreddits?

“Hey all, I’m considering quitting golf. Any hobbies you’d consider picking up?”

[before you decide to leave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXCm4BXJX40)
Atlanta maybe
"Take a good look at Michigan.  Not Detroit or Flynt, obviously, but look into Grand Rapids and Lansing. 

Tons of fresh water sources, nice summers, near big cities if want to go see a concert or just miss the metro vibe.  And land is cheap."
"My twin brother moved from Houston to Fort Collins and he loves it. Colorado is fun and beautiful. Yes, it is more expensive but I will take the bitter cold and snow that bleeds even into May over the alternatives a place like Houston or Texas has to offer. I currently live overseas but if I were to move back, I’ve considered Colorado as a place to relocate."
"I moved to Houston in 1976 with my parents.    Dad worked for Oil Companies and we had always moved around.
As luck would have it, I found the perfect man and married. 
I asked that he would think about retirement being in a place with 4 season. 
48 years later I’m still here, wanting so badly to move.      
I’ve lived in Peru, Las Vegas, NM, CO, OK, UT.    Would love to head north, CO, UT and maybe keep driving, looking for a new place to call home.
We live in Kingwood and I love our home in the forest, yes we were just hit by Beryl, so many down trees and homes without power, but the older community and its people would be missed."
“alaska” 💀
"I lived in Florida for a while and have never experienced what I have experienced here. Never had a power outage even after a hurricane .I moved here last year because of all the good things I have heard but it was all make belief. It’s like living with an abusive partner and refusing to see what they are doing to you. I am afraid of the rain now. I  almost afraid of everything here when it comes to infrastructure. I am ashamed to tell my friends if Florida of my experience as they thought I was moving to the best state in America. 
A small storm is not supposed to take out your light even a simple lightning means no electricity for days."
"There are going to be disasters everywhere.

That said, the midwest is probably your best bet, especially the eastern part, when it comes to climate change (no hurricanes, plentiful water, still got tornados and floods though, but we have those plus more)

It’s not in the US, but look at Toronto for example. They just dealt with some absolutely horrendous flooding, with roads and houses being inundated. It was a really crazy event. Only 167,000 lost power, in a metro area of 6 million people. And this was for weather they are totally not set up for. Like our freeze, for example. And look how that turned out for us…

You can’t escape climate change. Everywhere will be affected. But you could at least go somewhere that doesn’t encourage corruption and failure to prepare to the extent that Texas does."
Montana is about the safest choice but it's farmland so if you ain't got a green thumb you won't survive but like nothing ever happens there .. lol
Sioux City Iowa or Omaha Nebraska is nice
Chicago has comparable housing prices and expenses.
I’m checking out Costa Rica now. I could sell my home here and pay cash for one there. Just need to learn fluent Spanish! I’m very intrigued by what I’m finding.
My company has offices in a few other cities including Chicago that I may be eligible for transferral to
Canada
"My choice would be, Colorado- maybe denver outskirts during hot times, Cozumel during the cold times."
J
I am from Colorado if you want to talk
Ohio has the largest number of Texas transplants (people that move from Texas to another state). I lived there for a bit. Was nice. Lived in a little area called Kettering. It was probably the nicest place I've ever lived.
Pittsburgh come to mind. Just need to find a job up there.
R/samegrassbutgreener is right up your alley
Try California
Virginia Beach

"Property taxes are nuts in Texas along with HO insurance we pay 14k for a modest homestead in a FW suburb. My hometown of Indianapolis has a good cost of living, 1% capped property tax and good economy. February is brutally cold however."

"Charlotte, North Carolina."
"My kids live in Washington state. It’s absolutely stunning in the summer, but the winters are really long and really depressing."
Southern California has great weather
"Leaving cause of politics? Hmm 🤔 
Might as well go to Illinois"
Bentonville Arkansas
You don’t want to move. You want everything you want without spending lots of money. Of course you want to go to CO or the PNW. So does everyone else. And they already have.
Check out Cincinnati or Columbus Ohio

"I am in the same position. I want to move out of TX due to all the same reasons. I also have 3 daughters.

I would love suggestions on good places to move to that don't have super high cost of living & safer for women. I have always lived in smaller towns & work as a bookkeeper."
It’s hot af here ain’t it! I always thought about Washington
I love this trend! Please everybody bring houston housing back down!
Go to California. I hear it’s great there
We’re looking at Illinois. Got friends near the St Louis side of the state so a major city isn’t that far (in Texas terms) and Chicago is only 3-4 hours the other way iirc. That might be an idea
"My husband and I have been thinking about it too. But at this point if Trump wins there's gonna be no escape. It's gonna be hell everywhere, especially for women."
"Chattanooga, TN. I call it a reverse Davy Crockett. I’ve visited a couple times this year. Beautiful place. Smallish city. Good midsized university, awesome hiking, biking, bouldering, water access, outdoor activities. Homes are still affordable but they are going up. Fairly progressive vibe. Just unionized the first auto plant in the south. Growing tech jobs in shipping/distribution logistics, nuclear. Two hours from Nashville, Birmingham, Atlanta, Knoxville. I think a bunch of Texans have moved there recently and they might not be too happy about it, but that’s gonna be most places we would go."
"I just came back from a roadtrip in New England. I visited Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Massachusetts for 2 weeks and I loved it. 

A mix of old money glamour and blue color working class grunge, unique demographics (instead of Asians and Latinos it’s French and Portuguese speakers with a heavy dose of Italian and Irish Catholic), cute towns and sophisticated college cities, easy access to both mountains (beware of bears) and rugged coastline (beware of cold beach water). Colonial history just casually deposited in every nook and cranny. Beautiful flowers and trees everywhere since its mild weather. Heavy emphasis on farmer markets and locally sourced seafood. 

If I could get a job in my field up there with comparable pay I’d move up there in a heart beat. It’s like a microcosm of America in one concentrated area."
"Gus in Lonesome Dove told Lorena: “life in San Francisco you see is still just life. If you want anything too badly, it’s likely to turn out to be a disappointment. The only healthy way to live life is to learn to like all the little everyday things, like a sip of good whiskey in the evening, a soft bed, a glass of buttermilk…”"
"Pittsburgh, it’s cheap, pretty, up and coming, ppl are chill, and food is decent."
The next best state after Texas is Tennessee
"Salt Lake City. It’s overlooked and it’s growing, strong job market and companies are starting to relocate there, more diverse than you think, friendly and welcoming people. Good sports town (Utah Utes, Utah Jazz, Real Salt Lake, and now an NHL franchise starting up this fall). I visited there back in December and I was blown away. Beautiful mountains, scenery access is a lot closer than Denver, views for days. Very clean city, safe and well planned infrastructure. I plan on going back there in the fall. Not to mention they will be hosting the Winter Olympics again in 2034, which will be epic."
Best of luck! I want out too.
Cleveland. Especially if you work in healthcare 
"I recommend St. Louis. Great place to live, great options for fun, LCOL.  Baseball. Great medical options!!"
"Colorado was great for 4 years, but afterwards lost its charm.

No way am I working at Dominos in addition to my full time job, to make ends meet."
I'm in Houston myself. In my opinion there are better and worse places to live. Lots of people are coming to Texas and for various reasons.  Pretty much every city is going to have their climate issues and politics.  The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence.  I also caution you to move where you can have a decent paying job.   Money problems suck no matter the climate or the politics.
"Northwest Arkansas, it’s small but cosmopolitan because there are so many people there from somewhere else to service walmart suppliers. Beautiful mountains and lakes nearby, seasons, prosperity, and good cultural facilities and museums thanks to Alice Walton. Thriving University too in Fayetteville down the street."
"El Gallo, 2 locations - Jones Rd and Gessner."
Anywhere. Although you can’t run away from yourself.
"Well, I really just want to move out of the COUNTRY for 4 years, but I have been fantasizing about going back to Chicago for a long time. I've tried liking Houston/Texas for years but, I just don't. Sad."
"Upstate NY is going to be safe from the worst effects of global warming for a longer time than the rest of the US, and will end of holding a lot of southern refugees in the coming decades. Aim for Rochester. The rust belt will polish up nicely with a little work, and there’s a lot of people who are living in places that will be uninhabitable in the next 30 years."
"r/houston?

Have you tried a different city that isn't Houston?"
Move to Arkansas.
Bye
"Don't worry, we don't want you here lol"

East St Louis
Tennessee isn’t a bad option. Nashville is ok. Virginia is nice also.
I hear Detroit is nice this time of year
"Few more of these, and maybe we will have our state back. In the meantime, I'll keep telling the world we are full."
I’m probably gonna go back to San Antonio in the near future I’m kinda tired of this shit hole as well
I’m moving back home to Chicago tired of this heat and disasters
"I just moved back to Houston from Oregon. Portland is well beyond its previously hip reputation but the western suburbs in Washington County are great. No homeless camps, responsive police and an increasingly exciting food scene. You could easily venture into Portland but I found myself going into town less and less since Covid."
"I'm looking at Virginia Beach (but not really beach more like Norfolk), Baltimore, and Detroit. -For those that voted Minnesota - I agree!!! It's a great place but just be prepared for those winters!"
Maine
Upstate NY
My wife and I are planning on moving out within a few years. The only thing keeping us here is my elder in-laws and our low mortgage compared to anything we’ve seen recently.
Oregon or New Mexico or Michigan or Minnesota.   All good choices.  All have various levels of industry and housing is usually less than the national average (ok... outside of Portland).   All of them have beautiful scenery and fresh air.
Jacksonville Florida
come to NJ
"Hot weather? My dude, climate change is here...... Any state will seem novel at first. If I were looking to move, I'd try to list out the things I like/don't like about where I live currently. Then find the area that will give you more of the things you enjoy and fewer of the things you don't. If not, why else bother moving?

For instance, if I moved, I'd be losing my family which I am close to, basically all of my friends and the company I work for.

The only reason why I would consider moving is if it gives me something I don't have here, cheaper housing, more walkable, better weather, better job, better scenery, better health prospects, lower crime, etc. If moving isn't life changing, I'm not bothering at the moment."
I moved back to Europe. Sanity
"For anyone that's looking for support as we all figure this out, I am hosting a [meetup](https://www.reddit.com/r/HoustonSocials/comments/1e4yheq/leaving_texas_support_meetup_thursday_718_reza/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) at Reza Persian Grill this Thursday, 7/18 to figure it out together. I hope to see y'all there!"
"We left Houston due to jobs and ended up in North Carolina. 
This summer has been hotter than most, but we’re okay because we know it will end (for now at least) 

If I had my choice though, I’d look into chattanooga, TN 
It’s beautiful with tons of outdoor options. Smaller City so less expensive than your Denvers, Portlands, or Nashvilles."
Then go to colorado?
Byee
You don’t like the politics but you want affordable housing… there may be a correlation.
Please not Colorado. We have enough texans (and everyone else). 
See ya :) go post this in some other city’s sub. It’s literally an “anything but Houston” post which doesn’t belong here.
"I don’t blame you, I would leave too, and this is also what the GOP wants. I live in the PNW and love it here."
"If you just want to get out of Houston because of hurricanes, tornadoes, crazy storms and terrible infrastructure (which I also want to),but still good to be in Texas, Austin could be a good option."
"Centerpoint CEO and goverment  is reading this and going *""wayment, no ya'll are not leaving, we will close the borders before we let ya'll leave ""*

Sorry it looks like Texas may yet get to the point where they no longer allow citizens to leave in fear that they will not return"
A new week means a new help me get out of Texas post. Hopefully this fills the quota so I don’t have to see a post like this again.
"man being born and raised here, I guess im just blind to it. I really dont see Houston as that bad a place to live, especially if you consider the entire greater houston area. like yea the weather sucks but leaving would probably increase my cost of living or i would lose diversity, probably both."
"Move to California. 

Get out of Texas. 😂"
"Did you ever wonder WHY Houston is so much more affordable than NYC, LA and Chicago?

Oh well... The entire west coast is out of your price range. So is the upper east coast. The gulf coast is all hot and red (they all get hurricanes too). What about Minneapolis? It's plenty cold & everyone will agree with you. Maybe Detroit?

Anyways, congrats! Let us know what cold, cheap, liberal paradise you find!"
"Kansas or Kansas City. Food is comparable to Houston, new areas with new construction and lots of land, and nice weather compared to Houston."
"For my wife and I, we are moving to Oregon. Yes the cost of living seems higher, but so is state minimum wage and salaries to begin with. Not sure what professions you all are in but I know for our family it's what we're going to do. My wife will be able to make 80% more over the next three years as a nurse due to union contracts. Use the MIT living wage calculator to see if a move will be financially worth it. The data was updated earlier this year. 


Texas is 33rd in energy rankings while Oregon is 9th. The states average electric bill is sub 150. Your car insurance will drop probably 40%. But your groceries and housing will be more, as will gas."
"This has been coming up a lot lately. My wife and I have made up our minds that we are leaving too. Unfortunately, we just bought a house here and we need to work out our employment situation. It's going to be a longer road than we would like."

lol good luck.

"Stop moving to Mexico and Hawaii!! The locals do not want any more Americans colonizing their countries. 

That being said if you can find a place in the U.S. that caters to your needs and wants MOVE MY PEEPS!! I want to move too. I think I could move to my parent’s native country but I’m disabled sooo I don’t think I’d survive the heat and the environment."
Louisiana.
"Everywhere has hot weather at least once in a while. But if you want to avoid Texas-style heat, just head north. The red state/blue state thing varies over time and isn’t permanent, but remember that most blue states have state taxes on income and usually cost more. Minnesota or Illinois might be more your style though.

You might also want to consider moving abroad. Scotland is pretty cool year round. The temperature in Glasgow today? 67 degrees! Plus no red/blue nonsense to worry about."
"Consider Indianapolis. Been here from Houston for 15 years. Moving soon, but its a nice family city."
"Bentonville, AR

Huntsville, AL

The food, culture/entertainment aren't as good, but the cost of living is comparable and both have most of the big city amenities"
"Orlando...no state taxes, good food, nice people and you are close to the mouse. Just dont move close to Disney."
"Denver can go fuck itself. Give me Estes Park or give me death. 

BRB gonna go die."
"LA is basically what Houston modeled its self after

So there's that"
"It's the same crap everywhere you go, and it's that way because you're not the only one thinking this, and wanting to move. 

To add unto that, this same movement only ends up making things difficult for the locals wherever you end up moving. 

Happened to Houston, used to be very cheap and the tradeoff was the issues we've always dealt with to varying degrees. Now we still have those same problems at a higher cost of living. Damn transplants."
"We are exploring the same.  We actually moved from Colorado to Texas (North Padre Island).  We lived in Costa Rica for 5 years and came back to be closer to elderly parents  I am a native from Colorado growing up in Denver.  What a shock going home - Denver has grown at an unprecedented rate.  The infrastructure was not designed for the rapid growth.  Colorado is an amazing state with lots to offer, but unfortunately is not an option  as it has become unaffordable.  We love our beach life, but really miss hiking, biking, river fly fishing, and trees.  We've spent the last month in Tennessee - Chattanooga and Knoxville areas.  Although a ""red state"" we haven't seen a single Trump bumper sticker, flag or lawn sign.  Lower home prices, lower property taxes, similar vehicles registration fees to Texas and no state income tax.  Chattanooga is pretty cool and very central - 2 hours to Atlanta if you need a big city, 2 hours to Nashville and 1:30 to the Great Smoky Mountains national park.  Cool town, reminds me a bit of Boulder.  We're leaning towards making this move."
Good no one here in Texas wants yall democrat losers anyways good riddance move to Canada you might like their prime minister he seems to be doing good at taking away peoples freedoms
Canada is the way!
It's like everytime there's a bit of discomfort people just up and leave and I want them to its usually the type of asshole to jump from one city to the next because they can never be pleased good riddance
"For those saying you wanna run to blue states because they ""treat women better"" you might want to wait and see who wins the election because if Trump and Vance wins along with MAGA taking the house and senate because dumbass elite democrats want to push Biden aside instead of supporting him, they'll be a national abortion ban and traitor dems who back stabbed Biden will be the ones to blame. Many dems stand by Biden but the elite rich liberals and the media think they have a right to call the shots for all of us. I am furious about all the infighting and have never been so embarrassed to be a liberal before. We're a joke. We repeatedly shoot ourselves in the foot every time. The GOP proudly stands behind that felon and rapist Trump yet we can't support the best progressive president we've ever had and when democracy is on the line so we deserve to lose. I'm a POC woman and I'm staying. I love Houston and was born and raised here and I'm not letting the GOP or weather run me from my home so I will do all I can to change things such as vote. The grass is not always green on the other side just because of the way a state votes and if the dems keep screwing over Biden and eroding support, you best believe it will be a national abortion ban for sure. Then it won't matter where we live."
Well…bye.
Bye! 😂
Please leave! You will be doing us a favor.
Have you considered London?
grass is always greener
"If you have a house and can afford to move, you can afford a whole house generator."
"I know you said get out of Texas, but…it looks like Dallas checks off most of your boxes."
Please leave.
You’ll be back. I thought the same and went to Montana…lasted 2 years. I’m baaaack in Texas now.
Bye Felicia!
