"77396

Had to pick up my friends' cat because their attempts at coming back early from out of town failed. He's on a very different feeding schedule than my cats and they're all MAD someone is getting wet food when they aren't so pray for me because truly I'm more scared of them than Beryl."
I will not disrespect a cat 1 storm ever again.¬†

The CenterPoint outage tracker is literally the most useless website ever.  Ever since the last storm and we had the major outages they switched to that which offers no insight whatsoever.   The old website you could see what outage you were in and could decipher if there were crew or Troublemen working it or not.

"Hi everyone. Our reporter, Brooke Kushwaha, just got off the phone with Matt Lanza from Space City Weather. [Here's what he said: ](https://www.chron.com/weather/article/hurricane-beryl-texas-houston-live-19560277.php)

>Hurricane Beryl has maintained a surprising amount of punch as it rocks through the Houston area Monday morning.

>""It‚Äôs been very impressive,"" Space City Weather‚Äôs Matt Lanza told Chron.

>The system is expected to be out of the city by noon, Lanza said, at which time residents will have a chance to assess damage‚Äîsafely.

>""\[Beryl‚Äôs impacts\] should be manageable tomorrow,"" Lanza said. ""If you have a generator, try and share it. Check up on people.""

>Lanza noted that Beryl showed significant resilience even after making landfall on Monday. Expectations were for the storm‚Äôs wind gusts to weaken to 65 mph as it reached Houston, but the system maintained wind blasts in excess of 80 mph.

>""I think a lot of people were caught off guard by how strong winds like that are,"" Lanza said.

"[Here's a loop of the 12z HRRR run.](https://imgur.com/a/AHyGbO5)

Looks like a widespread rain event for most of the metro area with a corridor of strong winds likely for areas along a line from Sargent / West Columbia / Richmond.

It's a raggedy looking system right up until it gets its shit together approaching the coast and then organizes quickly into a compact hurricane. 

The trough cutting across the central US will absorb the low pressure system and kick it off the NE quickly which is good, but models are also hinting at a trailing line of training storms along the coast even after Beryl progresses into Louisiana and Arkansas. Definitely something to keep an eye on in terms of additional flooding potential."

From their website:

""A warm line is an alternative to a crisis line that is run by ‚Äúpeers,‚Äù generally those who have had their own experiences of trauma that they are willing to speak of and acknowledge. Unlike a crisis line, a warm line operator is unlikely to call the police or have someone locked up if they talk about suicidal or self-harming thoughts or behaviors. Most warm line operators have been through extreme challenges themselves and are there primarily to listen. A warm line has the purpose of reducing hospitalization and forced treatment, being a cost effective and non-intrusive, voluntary intervention.""

Disclaimer: I've never tried this service, but it seems like a nice alternative to a hotline if you aren't in an immediate emotional crisis but just need someone to talk to. I did not link to any specific Texas warmline since there are several."

"It‚Äôs raining but it‚Äôs not raining heavy, just constant. I‚Äôm just going to fuck off and get some sleep now. Hope y‚Äôall are staying safe. Good night (morning? Who the fuck knows)"
77009 heavy rain and just got a tornado warning
77007 I woke up just in time for the power to go out
"Anyone lives in 77054 knows of the flooding situation there? I worry about my cat, my cameras are down"
"Power officially out in 77035 after several rounds of off/on. Strong wind gusts, limbs down. Expecting no power for a day. Yay generator.

Eating snacks at an alarming rate."
"Loud pop in 77007, likely a transformer"
"Cypress, power went out for 30 seconds, came back on.  I‚Äôm filling up my tub with water now!"
"77006

Just got flash flood warning. The wind is howling. Rain isn't too bad yet"
"Accuweather radar shows the storm pulling to the left, did the path change?"
"Does anyone else have the wireless security system from Suddenlink/optimum?


Just found out tonight they have a tornado alert that's too high pitched for people over the age of 60 to hear. 


A ton of relatives were all nearer to it and it was going off for minutes earlier this hour. Took me 7 minutes to get to it and not a single person woke up besides me. 


Seems kinda like a shitty sound to use for a fucking tornado alert if nobody young enough is near. If there was a tornado and I wasn't home then my family would have never known till it hit us."
Enough sunlight to see how violently the trees are shaking outside.¬†
"77008 near 19th and Yale, power just went out for good after flickering for about 10 minutes.¬†



What really surprised us on our dog walk late last night is how little work people did taking things off their patios and lawns. Not seeing much stuff blow around but I‚Äôm sure there will be a lot of collateral damage from people‚Äôs laziness.¬†"
"77009, hopefully not jinxing myself but still have power. First hurricane in my first house and been just pacing my house since 4am. Crazy gusts every few minutes but the rain has been very manageable so far."
77063 Gessner/Westheimer - lost power at around 5am. A tree fell down in our backyard. The tree was already dead though it survived derecho and not Beryl. Should've cut it down when we had a chance. Glad it didn't fall on our house. Stay safe y'all.
"77041 jersey village power still on, honestly surprised."
"Spring/Woodlands, power has gone out maybe 10 times lasting max 1 minute. Looking at radar it‚Äôs about to get worse here for about 3 hours. Strong wind and rain so far."
Well this dumb shit isnt moving quick enough and im lucky my first floor apartment seems to have a spot where water collects and now its seeping in
"77043


Woke up to the flash flood warning on my phone and have no power. Internet on both phones is going insanely slow, tmobile and verizon"
"The bayous and water channels are now struggling to keep up. 

Not great news given we‚Äôve got a while left to go."

Texas Children's Pavilion for Women is on generator power
77006 power still on but holy shit there was some insane gusting...then it settles down and WHAM...Hurricane is not quite done whipping Houston's ass. I have been through more of these than I have fingers...you never get used to it.
"77459 Sugarland‚Äî drove overnight from Denver to get home early. Kroger at Hwy6 & 1092 still well stocked. 

For those that don‚Äôt know about spacecityweather.com , they give (IMO) the most practical updates for weather in the Houston area. I trust their info when making decisions"

"77356.  Got a generac and a new roof and plenty of supplies and charcoal if need be.  Just saw the latest forecast track on accuweather.  It actually crosses my street, which is about 1/2 mile long in total.  It literally intersects with my daily walking routine.  [https://imgur.com/wWuW0Ul](https://imgur.com/wWuW0Ul)"
"Strong farts knock out our power, pls pray for us"
"77581 - Sitting outside on my patio and enjoying the cooler wind right now. Occasional gusts but nothing dramatic yet.

I am a little bit concerned with how long it sits just off the coast. The longer it takes to move inland the stronger it'll be when it gets here."
"I really hope people are calling in to work

Going to work in this is stupid

It‚Äôs only getting worse from here until noon"
"Centerpoint is a joke.   Their 1970s grid cascades surges across the entire grid when one line goes down blowing out every breaker.    There is zero reason 95% of us should have lost power.      
They have zero remote control capability so now they have to send guys around for a week manually resetting every breaker just like you had to do in 1970.   Where did all their profits go for the last 40 years???  They keep adding to the grid but with no modern technology for controls.  Everyone in ERCOT and CenterPoint needs to be fired."
I hope this is my last year in this city. I loved it here but they refuse to do better. Yes I vote
"Millions of people are going to have no power, no AC, for several days, in July.  I hope everyone is ready‚Ä¶"

77407 cinco ranch area - calm and clear here. Me and the pooch just went for a walk before the madness starts
77092 I hear wind but no rain yet
"77043 - rain began 30mins ago, started light and just became heavier. The track looks like it‚Äôs gonna go right on top of us. Not sure I‚Äôll be sleeping tonight."
77539 League City. She‚Äôs definitely here- raining hard and I can hear the wind gusts. Power has stayed on though!
77531 lake Jackson area. It‚Äôs been rolling here for a few hours. Big gusts and heavy heavy rain
"77039, Northeast Houston, nothing bad here but steady rain. watching news & listening to police scanners. Fort Bend county, take cover, tornado warning"
"77007‚Ä¶ barely noticed it was raining. Been playing Apex all night and just hopped off to see what was going on. Power still good. 

Can hear some rain but no thunder/lightning. It was a a bit more intimidating driving back from Lake Charles Saturday morning üò≥ I thought that might‚Äôve been the hurricane. Fingers crossed it stays tame in this area."
"77586 Clear Lake, strongest winds and rain so far. The trees are getting a work out and power just went out again.¬†"
77035 Willow Meadows - torrential rains and stronger winds now. Sounds like I‚Äôm in a car wash. I don‚Äôt hear the wind howling like it did in Ike at least. Power still up but lots of green power flashes. Hang in there folks.
"77450 katy. Weirdly not too bad. The rain even stopped for a minute. Then picked up again but not worse than it was before. Kind of like that weird-calm-before-something-bad-happens feeling !!¬†

Edit to add- power is still on üí™¬†"
77055 seeing flashing of transformers in the distance
"Just woke up in Galleria due to the wind. I can feel the gusts through my window. Power is still on (for some reason I've never lost power in my 4 years of living here even though my apt neighbors have).

Wind isn't as strong as the derecho wind, but obviously more sustained.

Edit: 5 min after writing this, the wind just stopped completely. Like a switch was turned off. Weird."
"77043. Torrential rain now. Wind gusts clearly a thing from what I can hear. Third story apartment so not overly concerned, but the wind slapping rain against my window is intense."
"77089. Lots of rain. Lots of wind. Big tree branch killed my porch swing. Took my dog out back to pee while I pulled the branch off the porch away from the patio doors about an hour ago. 

Not terrible then, but it‚Äôs getting pretty rough as of about 5:15. Lost power four times for a few minutes, but it keeps coming back. Fear for my air conditioner being power surged to death.

Edit: power went out just after I posted. Center Point says it‚Äôll be back by 8:45am. I‚Äôll see it when I believe it. I thought the boom I heard was the branch hitting my swing, but I guess it might have been a transformer."
Power flickering in my area. Stepped outside and it's WIMDY
77035 Willow meadow - stepped outside to smoke and could see shingles flying off my neighbors roof
"77008, power went out at 5:15."
77450 katy- storm is really picking up but power is still on!¬†
I‚Äôm hearing transformers blow in west u
At least 533k w/o power right now
[deleted]
"77450 second update, power went out again 15 minutes ago and is likely out for good. Internet completely dropped as well despite UPS so that's pretty bad that means their network is completely down. Bossmang still ain't called it on work today, but supposedly they're heading in to take a look so we're gonna see. 
 
Neighbor took on some damage it looks like so that's gonna be fun. Parked by the dumpster and there's some trash blown out so if I do have to go in im gonna have to take a broom with me.  
  
For those with a radio, stations are still up and reporting. Use 740AM or 88.7FM or 162.400 weather stations.

Also, thank you to whoever said around 6am that they went ahead and made their coffee. I decided to go ahead and make some at that time and it's the only reason I have some right now."

77009 Norhill - Power has been out since 8am. Winds were wild but dying down now. Rain was constant but not as bad as I've seen it. 88.7 has been keeping me company - thanks for airing still Houston NPR. A little squirrel family has been hunkering down on our porch - good luck little guys!
"2 killed by fallen trees in Houston area

A 53-year-old man was killed by a fallen tree while riding out Hurricane Beryl with his family, according to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez.

The man, his wife and children were in a house in Atascocita in the Houston area when an oak tree fell on the roof, hitting the rafters, the sheriff said. The structure then fell on the man, killing him.

His wife and children were not hurt, the sheriff said Monday morning.

Hours later, the sheriff said a 74-year-old woman was killed when a tree fell on a home in Houston.

Shit just picked up considerably on the west side. Must be on the other side of the eye now.
77008 near TC Jester and 11th. No power since some time in the middle of the night as soon as the rain and wind picked up.
77006 ‚Äî Lost power around 8:00am and it‚Äôs still out at 12:30pm. I haven‚Äôt ventured outside yet.¬†
"Been without power and water in 77027 for over 4 hours now. Data finally started working 30 mins ago (T-Mobile).

No flooding here."
"Map now shows the center line going through sealy, tx.  Every update it moves more toward houston."
"I'm not worried about the storm. I swear I'm habituated to Cat 1 storms now since I've lived here my whole life. 

The easiest way to handle a hurricane is to hunker down in a safe place like my house because turn around/don't drown. 
Except for the fact that my job expects me in by 11am tomorrow after .48 in of rain every hour for 9 hours straight..."
Anyone else find it eerily relaxing to just sit/stand outside right now? Maybe it‚Äôs the sense of impending unknown and this is coming from someone who‚Äôs right on the path of expected sustained hurricane force winds
"Wow, the eye is on track to pass over downtown. This is the first time I've been in the track"
"If anyone is in dire need of a place to go (tree through your roof or something like that), I just heard that Gallery Furniture is allowing people to shelter in their store."
77077. About to go for a run before the rain.
"77062. Just got word from work that we're all expected to work our regular hours tomorrow remotely. If we lose power, we need to report it immediately, and the next work update will be given after 12pm tomorrow."
77005 - I‚Äôll move the plants inside for now. We will see what happens in a few hours
Just drove by Washington HEB and whole foods.  They looked packed.
Thoughts on my ability to make it to work in the Med Center from Missouri City area Monday morning?
"77062 holding it down for Clear Lake. 

Pretty sure the winds will be taking out part of our fence I pointed out to the insurance adjuster after the hail storm that he ignored me on, so gonna go rig a way to secure it here in bit after this band moving through peters off. Going to be playing Elden Ring as long as there‚Äôs power and doing block rounds hourly to keep drains clear. 

CoH OEM is still level III (increased readiness). 

As additional preparedness, if you or someone you know has a disability, is medically fragile, has limited mobility, or has access/functional needs, go register for [STEAR](https://stear.tdem.texas.gov/Login.aspx) which lets first responders know and helps them better assess and respond to needs in the community. It‚Äôs free."
"Departures for Hobby Airport we just shut down

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just temporary for this first band but if that tells you anything anything what tomorrow will be like"
Can't figure out when this shits gonna really pop off. Landfall doesn't mean when it'll be on i10
"77459

Waiting on work to say it's closed for tomorrow. Already planned to call off. Work will probably try to have people brave the storm to go to downtown. 

Waiting on husband to get home from work so we can get formula and gas. 

Will try to instacart what I can"
77056 - 4:30pm dark skies and nothing really to report
77587 South Houston. Had a few bands pass through and drop an inch of rain already. Some spots in Pasadena already have received 1.5‚Äù.
"77080

HEB off Gessner and Kempwood wasn‚Äôt super busy. I think people forget it exists."
"77025 again, um, why is it only moving 10mph ü•¥"
Anyone have a recommendation for a radio station to tune into for storm news and updates?
"77459, just woke up because my power went out and back on which triggered me smart lights. Happened two more times in a five minute period. Seems to be raining harder and pretty windy from what I hear.¬†"
77583 Rosharon- The wind is strong here and it‚Äôs raining hard. Thankfully lights are still on
"77025 Willow Bend just south of Astrodome. First time I heard wind outside so I opened the door and went out. Yep, it's a hurricane. Horizontal rain and wind gusts like Ike in 2008. Watching the interaction between trees and power lines nearby, I don't see how we keep power. Just since I started this comment, the sound of wind and rain has picked up measurably."
77058 Nassau - raining sideways and been without power for ~30 minutes now. Kids are still PTFO while I‚Äôm enjoying my first hurricane ever.
Welp. There goes the power in 77518.

"81 mph wind gusts in the med center, yikes"
"Just got power back in Galena Park, after being out for an hour and a half. I'm sure it won't last long."
77008 - Still have power but its cut out a few times and we flickering fam.
Next hour seems the most crucial based on radar. Metro area on the cusp of the eye wall
"77008

Heights & 13th near the Library. Lights went off for 10s and came back a few mins ago but been pretty solid so far. Got to survive the next 2 hours of peak winds before I can look forward to making it out of this. Peak rain rates appear to have passed now so its all about then wind. No flooding on my street."
"77006 montrose

Power has gone out about 6 times I can't believe it keeps cutting back on. Amazing"
"77005 lost power.

Lots of stuff coming down from the roof tops, shingles, gutter pieces, vent covers."
"77007 on memorial drive. Still have power, though it sometimes goes out for 30+ seconds. However, we have multiple leaks all over our apartment. We are barely keeping up."

"Anyone else jumpy and get startled by any random wind gust?

Took my dog out for a pee just now and it‚Äôs sad to see all the destruction and streets covered in green."
77380 power has been out 2.5hrs-ish. Resisting the urge to open the fridge to stare at food. Might give in soon.
Damn. The music KHOU plays behind their Weather Impact Alert segment is crazy. It‚Äôs like the score to a thriller meant to make you feel anxious.
Far SW Houston/Stafford area.  Already had a 2 hour power outage at 3AM this morning for whatever dumb reason.  Generac kicked right on though and we didn't even notice until we woke up and there was an alert on my phone.  Car is charged up.  Stocked up at the store earlier today also.  Should be good to go.
"So far no worse than a normal rain event here in the Sugar Land/Missouri City area. The wind has picked up, but nothing crazy (yet)."
"Dear centerpoint: 

Please tell your lazy programmers to put the ~~mail~~ map back up.

Edit: I hate autocorrect"

"What kind of name is ""Beryl"" anyway?"
Fuck Dan Patrick
77489 nothing but frogs
Couple cases of water and gased everything up. Going to fill bathtubs tonight. Cleaning the house today and already secured the backyard. Generator ready for action
77077. Starting to rain here pretty heavy.
77007. 2 bands of rain so far. Heavy rain and impressive lightning but wind hasn't been too bad. Nothing like the derecho yet. Glad I went to HEB yesterday.
"77069 - On and off rain, dark clouds, not much wind yet. Went out and got all my lose-ables secured. Need to go grab a tank of gas and I'll be all set."
"Up north in Conroe, was gonna do a quick trip to Houston today and then come back up around 7 or 8 PM, is it inadvisable to be on I45 today? I got the sense that the time to hunker down was late tonight/tomorrow morning but my work buddies are freaking me out"
77566 (Lake Jackson) getting a bit breezy here but nothing abnormal. More steady rain now vs quick 5 min heavy downpours
"77034 Ellington Airport area

Just a slight breeze."
77459 It sounds pretty bad out there which is making it difficult for me to try to get back to sleep. Probably stress from having to try to make it to work in the morning and worrying if my roof which is long overdue to be replaced will hold up. üò¨
77084. Bearly windy. A bit rainy. Watching storm chasers live stream.  Someone on the livestream said there‚Äôs a fire at a plant but I haven‚Äôt seen anything about it anywhere else
"77071 - power on still, crazy wind, and rain."
77029 occasional high winds and rains beating the walls of the house. Power still up. Not even a flicker. Internet annoying has been out since before the storm. #fuckcomcast

Intermittent flashes and booms by Independence Heights Park. Possibly transformers? Still have power but I can hear it buzzing as it strains
77096 near Parker Elementary. Finally lost power after listening to the transformer struggle for the last hour.
77022- lights kept flickering turning on and off and it‚Äôs now completely out ü•≤ so scary waking up to strong winds hearing the electricity poles getting hit by debris making them spark and cant even see well outside in the dark. It‚Äôs pitch BLACK
"77066 Willowbrook area - Power stayed on all night, right at an inch of rain through the gauge at 5:30.

Wind max 35 MPH.

Power stayed on until after I brewed coffee.  Got to my PC and power has now turned on and off about 7 or 8 times.

The longest it was off was about 25 seconds.  APC UPS devices kept my AT&T fiber and computer working.

I expect power will turn off and stay off for a while, soon."
"77598, power went off and on about eight to ten times tonight, and now it‚Äôs off and I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôgone fer‚Äôgood."

77584 finally lost power but at&t fiber still works great
"Lights have been off, but across the street still has power. Damn my luck."
"77098. Still thankfully have power. The wind is so loud in my apartment's courtyard, my neighbor just put all of her outdoor plants outside for the summer. RIP to those plants."
"77019 - no power. AC is still on miraculously, not sure how that works out."
"77433 getting gusts easily over 60 mph+ now, street water level is normal same with backyard. Very glad this wasn‚Äôt a stronger hurricane taking the path this one is."
Flickering in 77007 now

Per KHOU: An 18 wheeler overturned in La Porte. The Fred Hartman bridge is now closed in both directions.

wind gusts are so bad that i can barely see the trees that just got downed
77007 Heights (Studemont/Yale) surprisingly still has power as of right now
"77006

Seems like the heaviest stuff has passed. Giant tree fell right by the house just missing it. Water is still high, which I'm working on getting now."
"Oddly, we have ""half"" power in 77043. Looks like we lost a phase and can only power low-voltage electronics (no major appliances). Anyone else experiencing the same?"
Has anyone had power restored? And if so what zip?
Gas station at N Main and Airline was open and has beer. Huzzah
Woodland residents. How are you guys doing? I always think about moving there for weather related reasons.
"My anxiety is so bad right now, I just want this to be over..."
Space City Weather just issued an update. Very reliable for those new or just not privy.
Beryl needs to be deported. Coming from across the ocean to start all this bullshit lmao
"77007, First Ward ready and vigilant, everything will be ok, some rain and some breeze, don‚Äôt over-panic"
Still no email/call from work saying we don't have to come into office tomorrow (downtown)...
At least the sun will be coming up soon...
"You might need to re-enroll in Centerpoint alerts. I was somehow unenrolled between the derecho and today. Anyway I re-enrolled and just got a robo call from them that was like, ""yep, your power is out, sorry."" 77009"
Generally consensus I see is everyone if fed up with these unrelenting life changing events and storms! Same..... Same.... My job in Katy is closed with no power and that place never goes out of power! Even during the tornado
"Local news be like: 

Beryl is currently a tropical storm ‚òπÔ∏è,
But it could be a category 1 hurricane by landfall! üòÉ"
I do love this city for lots of reasons but I do have to consider my future here if I'm forever dealing with major weather events causing multi day power outages every 2-3 months to live here
"I hate that a few people commented on an article years ago and I have to hear, ""DID KATY EVACUATE YET?"" for the rest of my life."
"Strongest winds should be passing through Houston within and for the next 4-6 hours, then start to taper off. 

The bayou and water channels seem to be holding up well for now. At least 10 more hours of heavy rain to go."
"77011.

I tidied up the yard/put stuff away, did the grocery shopping yesterday, and helped my parents tidy up their yard & put stuff away. Usual tropical storm stuff.

I‚Äôve been telling people who have asked me what to do: plan to finish up anything that requires driving before about 3pm, and then just plan on staying home. We don‚Äôt need Harvey or Allison levels of rain for the roads to turn into a shitshow, so why chance it?"
"https://www.harriscountyfws.org/


This is good if you need to monitor water levels in the channels near your house"
"I should clean out my gutters, thanks for the reminder"
"77433. My first hurricane as an adult in Houston so not sure what to expect. 

Wasn‚Äôt living here for Harvey and evacuated for Ike and Rita as a kid. Did experience TS Allison fwiw and that was traumatic as a child to say the least haha 

I‚Äôve got water and snacks so I guess at least it‚Äôs a cat 1 (or  less hopefully) so I can see how I fare and adjust accordingly for the future. I‚Äôm in an apartment so no generator but I have begun looking into portable power stations 

Stay safe everyone"
"channelview area. compared to the huge storm in may how bad will it hit us? with the last storm we lost power for 4 days

"77073 1960 & 45
Just had heavy rain for about 10 minutes and now it's sprinkling but I can hear some thunder."
77384- went from sunny and hot to dark and raining real quick.
77345. can‚Äôt confirm for android but the weather app on iOS has a precipitation map view that allows you to zoom into neighborhood level and see where the hurricane is relatively located.
"77025 Calm, but we've just been given a tornado watch."
I‚Äôm seeing posts about it now being a direct hit for Houston. Any truth to this?
77380. Stress eating while waiting for what's to come. üòÖ
77098 - steady but light rain. Cool wind picking up a little. Grayish night sky.
77479 got first power flicker. The eye is projected to pass over our home as a cat 1 now
"77091. Light, steady rain here. Nothing crazy yet and I hope it stays that way.."
"77025. Took dogs for a last walk before the red stuff gets here. Pretty quiet with light rain, but a warm slow wind blowing in. Going back to bed for a few hours to see what the morning brings."
"77532 scattered rain still, and a few gusts. Wondering if I can catch a nap for a bit."
"77441. Power lost about 15 minutes ago. Doesn‚Äôt feel/sound too bad outside right now, though."
77058 transformer blew at 4:27 no word on repair
"77084. Transformers blowing close by. Powers flickering, going out soon for sure. Wind and rain is picking up. Matches the radar bands. Mildly excited to maybe experience a eye of a hurricane"
77008 power just flickered twice...
77007 power flickered off and back on.
"77025 Willow Bend. Power has winked and blinked a few times just now. And then I thought I lost it, but it came back after a few beats. 

 After that last power surge, my air conditioner, central air unit right outside my first floor window, began making a rattling and humming noise and now it's not cooling even though it's on."
77459 I really expect to find at least one of my home security cameras blown off my house by the time this passes. I can't recall experiencing wind like this right in my area before.¬†
"77062, no power, transformers going left and right."
"77450 - UPS's are working overtime as the power has started flickering off and on a few times, so I'm hurrying up and taking the browns to the Superbowl now and not later while there's still time.

I'm eyeballing the local HCFWS gauge for the Mason Creek that runs through and it's shot way the hell up. [5 feet in last hour](https://www.harriscountyfws.org/GageDetail/Index/2020?From=7/8/2024%205:45%20AM&span=24%20Hours&r=1&v=surfaceBox&selIdx=0) has me very concerned for the morning.

Edit great, Comcrap just went out for a bit."
"77034. We have power but it‚Äôs not the most stable. Hoping it stays on, we‚Äôve got a leaking window that we‚Äôre having to use a shop-vac on to keep it from flooding our bedroom.


Edit: power out at 6:41"
77007 power out
"77084 - after a placid night, we just lost power 5 minutes ago
Everything looks fine outside. Rain and wind but the street and area looks fine"
77459 With the sun it I can see my shared fence with my backyard neighbor has fallen over. Not looking forward to having the conversation about who is responsible for fixing it.¬†
77429 just lost power 10 min ago
"77098 upper Kirby

Lights have flickered but we have kept power. However our apartment is filled with water so that‚Äôs a nightmare.¬†"
"77539 - slept for the past 3 hours, woke up to power still existent. I think I‚Äôm close enough to UTMB League City‚Äôs power grid that this is the miracle keeping things on.¬†¬† ¬†

Nonetheless, it‚Äôs still gusting and raining sideways. Beryl was declared as a cat 1 but some wind speeds near landfall were nearly cat 2. She‚Äôs also not moving on as fast as we thought she would and has shifted eastward AGAIN making her path right through Houston. If you look at radar forecasts (Accuweather‚Äôs here¬†https://www.accuweather.com/en/us/league-city/77573/weather-radar/340890 ), they actually have her somewhat spinning in place after this first wave is gone? Around 9:15 you can see it looks like a new eye just reforms around Bay City?!"
77429 - no power here! I saw someone recommend if you still have power to lower the temperature of your fridge and freezer so you get a bit more time out of them!
77006 midtown currently no power and had been flickering on and off for the last couple hours¬†
77493 Katy. Lost power before 7 and cell service is spotty
77002 - live in downtown and still have power thankfully
"77007 right next to downtown, I suffered a lot of damages from the derecho but no additional damages so far from beryl and everything seems pretty fine for the time being.

11:18 edit, still in the storm bit gusting is getting pretty crazy, some water started dripping from my hvac/ac areas saw some humidity forming in the attic but nothing looks like its leaking leaking.  Some water damage occured around the vent in the ceiling of my home office/bedroom 3 of my place."
"77004 in midtown

power went out twice and came back. 

Heard a loud pop, I fear it was a transformer that went off. Power is now gone"
[deleted]
77007 East of TC Jester. Had power in and out about a dozen times over the last hour but it seems to be out for good now.
"Sorry to sound stupid - first time renter on the second floor, how in the world is my roof leaking if I‚Äôm on the second floor? Genuine question!"
77004 - are things easing up or is it my wishful thinking? I‚Äôm so anxious I have a headache and the runs so may not be realistic.
"I have frozen water bottles in my freezer. Should I throw them in my Yeti cooler with my food or leave everything in the fridge? It's not much, just fruit and veggies."
Welp the street is almost completely flooded  77011
"Think the back side of the storm has come, 77077"

"77095, no power since midnight and it‚Äôs 1pm now. Nothing but a giant Walmart has power but overall damage isn‚Äôt too bad."
When will it be safe to drive from Montrose to Katy? My friend said I could go stay with her in Katy since she has power.
"77479 - no power. Water works. Cell service for att doesn‚Äôt work, my work Verizon does. Been without power since 2am. Trees down around my area."
"Man that first wave is a real bitch! The weatherman lied to me lol. Time said starting at 12:45 so I thought I'd get a last bike ride in before it rains all week long.

Cue me getting drenched on the sidewalk along I-10 at 12:15, a full half hour ahead of schedule. I am very very lucky that I made it the rest of the way home somehow with only getting soaked and not hit by lightning or a car on the way. It totally took me by surprise like it was dry and dark in the distance one minute and tropical storm the next."
77009 hunkered down and beer protocol is activated. Hoping for no power outages!
Kemah area. Can't sleep. Might as well play some Civilization VI to pass the time.
Morons in Katy are shopping on live TV at the Buccees.  They dont realize they are in the eye and the tail end is coming.  Wow.
"77007 here, it‚Äôs getting windy and the rain is picking up.

What is everyone doing to keep yourself busy?"
Power outages over 1.1 million now
77084 - really bending us over a beryl here
"77030

I've been in Houston for barely a month. This will be my first hurricane and I'm really scared. I did pack a hurricane kit and emergency supplies, etc, but I'm still going to be alone in facing the storm. Hopefully nothing too significant will happen and I wish us to stay safe and good luck!"
"Galveston upgrade to hurricane warning

More than likely due to a east wobble of the center of circulation 

Looking like a Freeport landfall possibly 

If so Hurricane force winds are guaranteed for Houston"
77027 - Didn't know this was a serious thing LOL I just drove back from Little Rock a few hours ago. Got a day's worth of food from takeout leftovers and filled some pots with water. The more I learn. First tropical storm for me in Houston (from MA).
Westside. Power is out already. Here we go again
77389.  Just woke up. Slight wind and rain. Just lowered the AC to 68 to cool the house down for the power outage that is sure to happen shortly. Debating watching porn.
people were saying the winds will not be crazier than than derecho but man these are bad
Centerpoint says 1.1 million without power currently.
"A lot of my neighbors still have tarps on their roofs from the last catastrophic weather event. I remember one I told I was looking to get transferred to another state. His response was ""why would you leave Houston?"".

Huh"
"11 high voltage transmission lines are reported to have fallen down.    
This was gusts under 100 mph, so pathetic. They all must be rusted out.  Centerpoint needs to be fired."
77027. Moving vehicles to higher ground (garage) with full tank gas. Stocked up on some food/MREs. Cash on hand. Four battery banks charged up. No generator
"77063 heavy rain for the past hour, thunder. HISD is closed tomorrow and Tuesday."

Anyone know if metro will run tomorrow?

77070 rained a little now totally quiet.
Hopefully communication stays up
"Anyone know if it's making landfall as cat 1 or 2? I thought it would be cat 1, but some people on Twitter are saying cat 2. I'm hoping real hard it's cat 1."
"77063 - rain is picking up fast, the wind is coming on strong, but still have power for now"
Getting ready for work as usual and can hear the wind pick up from the toilet
"77061 Next to Hobby. Flickering Power/Lights, news antenna signal going on and off."

77008 Lazybrook. Power out now.
"77013. Heavy wind and rain. 

Intermittent power outage in this area. 

Winds intensifying. 

Power loss expected. 

Be safe out there, everyone.


Update: power loss about one hour ago. 

Centerpoint sent a text about restoration expected time frame of 8: 15 am. 

Think they have to wait until the storm passes to get started. 

Thinking more like end of day."
"77035 Willow meadows - power has flickered several times, but all is well over here otherwise"

Can't sleep between this storm and a healing tattoo"

"77016 Scenic Woods. More heavy gusts, and the rain has picked up substantially. Nothing crazy yet. Power hasn't flickered, and my flood prone street is still looking good."
77042. No power for around the last hour and one of my bedroom windows turned into a faucet so that's been fun
77459 power is gone gone. What makes this wind so crazy is that the gusts are sustained for so long. My whole house is creaking.

Wow damn.  Power is flickering at 77034.

"77493 Katy- Franz/99 area

Power still on for now, but flickered just a minute ago. Wind is batshit. Rain is heavy. My poor dogs haven't been able to go outside to go pee (one of them always takes a dump right after he eats, too)."
77489 near the Ft. Bend Toll about 5:30ish. Power was off and on for about 10 minutes till it finally gave up. Great time to find a few minor leaks üò≠

"77057 Don‚Äôt want to jinx it, but my power is still on. A couple of pretty quick off-ons in the post couple of hours so who knows."
77536 Deer Park -- lost power around 5:40 am. Nothing major otherwise. Hopefully that is all until this storm moves on through. Sounds like the worst will be over at around lunch for my area.
77429 just lost power few mins ago was fighting to stay on but gave up after few flickers
"77070


No power as of 6am. Probably going to wait to go to work until later.¬†"

77079 - anyone know how they're doing? I'm out of the country but I have someone cat sitting for me.  I hate not knowing what is going on.
"I see a big branch that‚Äôs sitting precariously after breaking off on my neighbor‚Äôs lot. Their house is abandoned, I‚Äôve never met them but their info is probably on hcad. Who/how do I contact? Thinking about sending a certified mail"
055 I'm afraid to mention the power situation and jinxing it ü§ê
"77433 is without power for the last hour or so. That portable generator, shed, natural gas connection and power inlet I just finished with yesterday are coming in clutch!"
"I am dumb and thought my generator would run in the rain like an atv or motorcycle, it cannot.  Does anyone have an opinion on it f a temporary/ make shift tent with a 18' pool cover and some landscaping posts will work.  Going to ventilate each end and sides for quality airflow but can keep it away from the house.

Edit: Upon more research my refrigerator and freezer should be fine until I can run the generator around 1 after the second phase of the storm (in Richmond).  At least this gave me something to do to pass the time."
77030 no power since 7am. I can see the hospitals from my house but I just barely am outside the grid sadly. Does anyone know when you usually lose water in a hurricane? This is my first time really
"Where in houston still has power? I just came hkme from work in the medical center. No power outage I don't think they have the backup generator on. Drove 10 min home, my side of town is out of power. My lease is up soon, thinking about moving  closer to medical center to prevent power outage"
Anyone else lose water too? Out close to i10 in Katy and seems like it's out in the last hour

"77008. Heights & 13th

Finally lost power after flickering lights for a while. Been iff for a good 15 mins now."
Does anyone know why our toilets aren‚Äôt flushing in our house? Sorry if a dumb question. First hurricane as a homeowner so unsure if that is normal.

We're out of power and our unit is full of water leaks

77060 Aldine area no power since 7 am
"Well, I jinxed it. 055 here. Neighborhood still powered up, but a tree just fell and took out my line to the house and pulled it out if my meter. Guessing I have to sort out the tree first before Centerpoint will fix it?"
77459 Cell coverage has been spotty with T-Mobile. Anyone know if it'd be safe to get to the Med Center now? Trying to decide if I want to go in to work to save half a day of PTO.¬†
"77030, right at the med center. No power since 9. Typically don‚Äôt loose it during storms. Hope it‚Äôs back soon. Very calm weather now. Projected to rain again in an hour then till 3pm. Bayou pretty flooded."
Power on in 77008. Lost it for about a minute an hour ago.
No power in 77571. Been that way since 5 or 6 this morning.
"77071 again. I feel like the absolute worst of it might be over? There‚Äôs still an occasional powerful gust and I *think* a tree by my window is damaged (not enough to impact the house) but it‚Äôs not as bad as it was four or five hours ago. 

Out of curiosity, how‚Äôs power at 77042? My workplace is in that area and we‚Äôre closed until Wednesdays anyways but I‚Äôm just a bit concerned."
Anyone else struggling with cell service around XXXXX?
77099 area - can anyone report in from how it's looking looking by you in the Southwest Houston/Alief area?
"77014 update

Still no power and about 40 minutes ago, we lost cell signal -T-mobile

We will get a bar here or there, but there is no real signal.


For those that have a generator or battery backup, if you power your router and modem, there is a good chance you will regain wifi again."
77054 no power
Any news for 77546 - Friendswood? My sister is in labor at HCA Houston Clear Lake and we want to know if their house is okay.
Is the centerpoint map down? (I saw it this morning and can‚Äôt find it again)

ABC 13 is wild right now. first car watch and now no power.
"77004 Power out since 5:30.  Heard a loud boom outside that could have been a transformer going or just something heavy getting blown around. Time to make Centerpoint a utility again and fark ""duty to the shareholders"" bs. Modernize the grid and bury the lines."
"Full tank of gas in car. Got all my devices and backup batteries fully charged. Got my solar powered fans ready to go. Bathtubs filled with water. Movies and shows downloaded to my tablet for offline viewing.

Nothing else to really do at this point except wait. I really hope the power holds. This neighborhood held during the derecho."

"77406, nothing happening right now weather wise, but the latest AccuWeather forecast now has the path tilted so far that a storm that's been coming in from the west is now projected to go (very slightly) east of me.

So the only way we are avoiding anything here is if it continues to aim towards Houston."
Can‚Äôt wait to wake up to an email saying I need to come into work in-person when there‚Äôs major flooding!
"77571, La Porte -- Winds are picking up with 30 mph wind gusts. I am pulling an all-nighter watching this storm. Haven't lost power yet."
Does anyone know what time the storm will ‚Äúbe over‚Äù ? Pass downtown?
77009 so far so good. Only concern is that Since the Derecho rain has caused yard and drainage ditches to flood (never been issue last 5 years). Wonder if we still have some storm debris backing things up.
"77084. sitting in the eye of the hurricane. Its calm. no rain, no wind. went and took my trash out and take in the once in a lifetime experience. i watched storm chasers try and get it at the coast last night. and im just here"
Is the rain forecasted for today not associated with Beryl? I‚Äôm confused as to when it‚Äôs actually going to hit us
"My family thinks its a good idea to get a car out of hobby in the morning in case we need to leave town, but im not sure if that's a good idea, any thoughts? I figured if we wanted to leave we should have done so already."

77007 - My power was out for 30 minutes around an hour ago and now it has been on and off since. I'm watching Khou live and Hidalgo mentioned the worse is yet to come for Harris so brace for the next 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Holy Moly y‚Äôall"
"77450 again, power is still out since 6:30. Winds got a bit quiet just now I think the eye is about to pass through. Houston public media has been keeping me entertained on the crank radio but I'm too chicken to call in like I want to so I'm gonna post on here instead üòÇ

Work finally called it thankfully, we're closed today so I'm staying home. I tossed on a raincoat and headlamp and some gear and did a quick 5 minute walk around the apartment just to check damage but didn't venture too far. Mason Creek is flowing fast AF like a raging white water rapid river, I would not want to be out in that. One of the carport roofs took some damage, as did some gutters as did a section of apartment exterior on the neighbor's that looks like insulation is exposed. Headlamp came in handy as it's completely black in the hallway, water on concrete and trash cans blown everywhere and a few exit signs torn apart from the wind tunnel effect. Apartment has taken some wet spots on the ceiling, i put buckets underneath to be safe y'all can also use trash cans storage bins whatever as needed. Temp gun shows its already 78 inside so it's gonna be fuuuuun if it doesn't kick on soon (and based on 1m+ without power rn it likely will be). Trying to decide if i want to bug out to folks later or not when the storm clears."

"77070


A ton of wind now and heard it got downgrades to a tropical storm.¬†"
"77356 here.  The storm seems to have passed.  The generac is doing it's job and the yard is a mess, but overall we came through it in good shape."
"I know generators need regular maintenance, but we have one from the ice storm that hasn‚Äôt been used since, mostly bc we‚Äôre not handy and just overall unfamiliar with mechanics, and thankfully have not needed it since. Is it a total loss having been unused or not maintained for 3 years or does it stand a chance to be serviced and brought back to life?

Our power came back thankfully but this is just the beginning of a long hurricane season."
"77043


There's a power truck at kempwood and manila!"
Maybe a dumb question but any way to get to Dallas? Looks like we could take 610 to 45 but there‚Äôs flooding at West rd. We have a baby who needs medical treatments and our backup power has failed

"Update from [77449...](https://old.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dxf6si/beryl_megathread_the_cooper_knocks/lc6jcno/)

7 hours later, power's still out, but the storm seems to be done here.  Nothing except a garbage can fell over, a table that was on it's side (I put it like that) was on it's top, and then a VERY heavy closed umbrella and stand *moved a foot to the north and wound up on top of that table.*

o.0

Some wind...

Anyway, lucky, we're all good here, now, thanks... how are you?

You're sending a squad up?  Well, I won't blast the comm panel if you make the power work...

Anyway, generator is now up and running on propane.  We would have had it on natural gas, but apparently it's not flowing enough now to run it.  It tried to start, I can smell it in the exhaust (and boy did it have a nice *BANG* in the muffler when the propane started up, that was fun.), so... yeah.  There's that.  

Got about 2 or maybe 3 hours then I gotta swap tanks... then I got another maybe 2 hours.

Hope they get the natural gas goin'... or power, either will do.

Once again, good dang luck to everyone, and I hope y'all did ok."
"Hey all I‚Äôm currently out of state and have a flight Tuesday afternoon- I‚Äôve been tracking the best I can and flight hasn‚Äôt been cancelled yet, but from what you guys see it‚Äôs on the ground is the damage being done going to keep roads closed / flooding / etc to be able to drive around / have a flight land?

On the Centerpoint Outage Tracker, does anyone know what the difference / clarification is between 'Customers affected' (currently at 2.2mil) and 'Active outages' is?"

"77042 near beltway 8 and westheimer. lost power 6am Monday and still don‚Äôt have it. 

Does anyone know where I can find a timeline? I read somewhere that they would have one by noon today but didn‚Äôt see one other than numbers, but I want to know when my neighborhood will get power back.

I saw that Centerpoint said they‚Äôll have 400,000 more up by Friday night and 350,000 more up by Sunday. What about everyone else? Who knows?"
"The wind is dying down over the metro but it is NOT OVER!  This is the eye, the backside is coming.  It won‚Äôt have near the rain and the wind won‚Äôt be as strong, but it‚Äôll be still pretty strong.  The problem is, the wind will be coming from a different direction, there will be more damage."
"77018. No power. 

Any liquor stores gonna be open in the area?"

Power been flickering last 20 minutes. My PSUs keep clicking on and off. 100% buying a generator this month. This kind of weather is only going to become more common.

I know it's dangerous but does anyone know the damage situation around 2nd ward/ East end from what I see it's mostly down branches but not as much damage like during the derecho
"I have a flight out of IAH tomorrow, Monday, at 4:20pm. Should I move it earlier or to Tuesday?"
Is it still considered a hurricane? It looks like it's not gonna exceed mid 40s around here? Man I wish I could just knock myself out and sleep through it lol

About 3 hours out on a hot flight from Amsterdam. So you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs a storm or something?
Cypress is overall the best place to be in Houston.

Is this the end?
"LOL Hildago showed up to work today to showboat on the news. I guess it is not a mental breakdown day while making $200K a year, such a hard life.  She is just as bad a ted cruz for not showing up to work.  
I say this as a disappointed liberal democrat.  Her conduct has been pathetic."
This storm was underwhelming . I expected a little chaos and all there was wind and rain for like 1.5 - 2 hours . Am I crazy?¬†
Things are good in San Antonio. So glad we left
