Just heard on the news that 75% of CenterPoint’s grid is without power….soooo yeah 😕
Gotta love Centerpoint’s state of the art outage tracker!!!!
77006 Montrose. Power finally decided to go out just a bit after 10. Actually thought we were gonna make it there!

Anyone in 77011? The temperature is rising and it’s getting more and more unbearable for us and our dogs. Really pissed that I’m going to have to blow money on a fucking hotel and pack and transport my two dogs AGAIN and replace the $250 wor th of food that’s going to spoil in the fridge 
77006 out for 2 hrs now
"77429 Shaw Rd & Northpointe Reach

Power out since 7:37AM. AT&T Fiber was going strong until my backup battery died."
"77388 Spring, lost power about 45 minutes ago. Getting strong winds, hoping no trees come down on my house."
77019 Montrose out since about 10am
77027(Greenway Costco area) power back on
Space center weather’s most recent update mentions that we have 2.3 without power compared to 2.1 from Ike. Which doesn’t make sense considering wind speeds. https://spacecityweather.com/a-beryl-moves-away-our-focus-turns-to-recovery-and-coping-with-warm-days-and-power-outages/
77080 - power out since 4AM. Feel like it won’t be back for days 🥲
"After battling centerpoint's website all day I finally linked my electric meter so they could provide me with notifications, and enabled said notifications. 


I am in 77019 and I just received an automated call from centerpoint saying that my outage is impacting 2635 customers and they apologize for the inconvenience. 


The message did not include an ETA just instructions on how I could sign up for even more notifications. "
"77447, we have power, and no sign of it going away. There is no flickering or anything, either. I hope everyone gets their power back soon."
77477 power back on!
77006 Montrose - no power back yet. Lost power at 6AM
"Pro tip that I've been using to keep friends and family updated:  check https://ambientweather.net/ 
(if you have cell internet or can contact someone who does) as a proxy for a power outage map.  

In this case, it's more of a ""power on"" map, showing you rough areas of homes that currently have power.  You have to zoom in and move around a bit to load all of the data points, but those are your neighbors with weather stations that are currently transmitting.  Draw little blobs around the areas that have no stations, and you can infer that there's no power there. 

Sure, some may be powered due to generators or batteries, but it's a good enough guess to know if you might be _close_ to an area that has been restored.  

You can also look at the charts for a given station and see when it lost and regained power.  So, if it was off between 9am and 5:50pm, you can probably guess that it's a true mains restoration. 

Hope that helps.  

- Your friend who escaped town yesterday"
"77008 near Shepherd and 20th, we've had power this whole time (flickering on and off but no real outage). Hope everyone else is doing okay!"

"I just drove from the Med Center to West U. One intersection had a working light on Holcombe.

"Saw center point trucks around 77478, this is where the center point plant is located at. I live around the corner from it and still no power. EDIT just saw a centerpoint truck getting tacos at 12751 S Dairy Ashford Rd. Btw it’s open tacos are 2.50 each. Light is back up and running 77478"
77008. Heights and 13th. Power stayed up through most of it but went out around 9:40 am. The issues don’t appear to be as widespread as the derecho here with many parts of the heights having power. The flickering before it finally gave up suggests a transformer issue instead of something more binary like a downed line that would take longer. Hopefully they just turn the transformer back on and we’re back.  Just in case I booked a room at the Marriott on columbia and i10 as a backup plan for tonight.
77007 out since 7:50am

"77092, been without power since 9am. Looks like zip codes around us are getting restored, so with any luck we'll have power back soon. Seems like they're starting with downtown and working their way out?"
"Still no power in 77087, it’s been off since 6am. The data/internet on my phone (AT&T unfortunately) hasn’t been working since 9:30am. There’s like 1 bar for most of the day. I could ping Google and Cloudflare DNS servers, but the latency was in the 500-1100ms range, name resolution would timeout. 

Works perfectly with 5 bars a mile down the interstate and when we drove around the Heights.

No power is one thing, no data is a whole different circle of hell"
