"Wanted to say this megathread has given me such comfort over the last few hours - we really are in this awful situation together and it so sucks. Just wanted to show my appreciation for all of you from an incredibly dark, hot, and humid 77023!"

"If you have limited cell or internet service, here's a link that requires minimal broadband access to load with more information how to stay cool during a power outage, get recovery assistance, stay safe if using a generator and get mental health support during a climate disaster: [https://www.texastribune.org/text/5SAeYWYX/](https://www.texastribune.org/text/5SAeYWYX/)"
Damn it's hot
"Oh and Jesus lord. 

If you’re running a generator, don’t have it inside 😓

Deer Park FD had to respond to multiple instances of carbon monoxide last night, because people were running generators in non ventilated areas."
"That nap just made me sad. Based on the color it shows we have power but as I’m typing this in the dark hot ass room with no power, it feels like we’re gonna be at the end of the list and having to wait days. Fuck center point"
Fuck centerpoint. Their entire corporate staff can go to hell and forever remain there.
"As an addendum, please be good neighbors and check on elderly residents.


Addendum to Addendum:  learn from the derecho and don't buy massive amounts of perishables until the grid stabilizes. 




Edit:  Please read the main post as some new information has been posted. 


Mods: Please pin."
77042 rooms are kinda hot me and the family cannot get any sleep at all might need to clear out the fridge in a few hours if power doesn’t come back.
"77494 and no power, shit service, but i’m glad they restored power to the light fixture store that is closed and has 9000 lamps in the windows. gonna take an edible & sleep on a cold towel i guess"
77008 - just got power.
my cell service (t mobile) is worse than it’s been at any point
"Museum District 77004 near Fannin/Binz still without power. I haven’t seen any CenterPoint workers after driving around here, Midtown/Montrose, Rice Village, or River Oaks. Where are the supposed 12k workers at?"
I feel like the updates are getting slower and slower as it creeps into the evening…
"The crazy part about this is our area was out for 5 days in May and you could **SEE** the damage. Like down poles, etc. This time we're down still and there is nothing visible in the area. It's actually insane."
77057 This no power thing is actually starting to mentally affect me. Drove to HEB on San Felipe and not a dang utility truck in my area not one.
"My map status is orange, I have truly no idea what “assessment in progress” means but it seems like that’s the worst category out of the three. 

Just took some melatonin, if I don’t wake up to power tomorrow my dog and I are getting out of here tomorrow morning."
The map isn’t accurate so I don’t know what kind of false hope they are trying to pull. It’s showing my area as green and my apartment block plus surrounding are still pitch black
Anyone know how the process is to get FEMA help with food. $200 in groceries gone after this crap
The Centerpoint outage tracker is increasingly confusing to me. It couldn't actually be that more outages are starting... could it?
77009 white oak st by the park. Just got power back at 11:50 am July 9
"For anyone in Entergy territory, they posted a nice long detailed update earlier today. I posted a copy of it in the 'power outage updates' thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/lce2fgt/"
"77007 my brother just spotted line workers, so it shouldn’t be much longer."
Does anyone else show as energized on the outage map but doesn’t have power
The number on the outage tracker actually went up. Lmao is this a joke.
Another section of 77008 just came on (W TC J & 18th)
"FYI - got an email from Murder by the Book with the following:

>For those in the Houston area, if you’re without power, we’ll have a cool space, free refreshments and plenty of power strips for device charging from 12-4 today. Please don’t hesitate to stop by! We’re happy to help with charging in forthcoming days as well. Our event with Meg Gardiner tonight is still happening, and we hope to have a good crowd for her, as her books are some of our staff favorites!"
"CenterPoint just sent this email out:

Restoration efforts underway following Hurricane Beryl
We are working around-the-clock to restore power to the 2.26 million customers affected by Hurricane Beryl. The first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, Beryl significantly impacted CenterPoint’s service territory, with damaging winds reaching 97-miles-per-hour in Brazoria County, 89-miles-per-hour in Harris County, and 78-miles-per-hour in Galveston County, according to the Houston-Galveston National Weather Service.  

CenterPoint took steps to secure substantial mutual assistance support before the storm made landfall. These crews were positioned in nearby locations for safety and accessibility. As the storm intensified and the scale and scope of the damage increased, we secured additional mutual assistance personnel. When it was safe to do so yesterday, CenterPoint released crews into the field. All told, we have mobilized nearly 12,000 frontline workers to focus on our restoration efforts.  

[restoration timeline link below]

There are many factors that contribute to our process. Please know that we are working diligently to address the issues affecting our system as safely and as quickly as possible. We will send updates as they become available informing you of the restoration stage you are in.  

For more information visit our Storm Center and follow us on X (formerly Twitter) for real-time updates. Be sure to enroll in our Power Alert Service® for outage details, estimated restoration times and community-wide updates.  


https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/Documents/Restoration-Timeline.pdf



Edit: I’d just like to add that since my home apparently fits in restoration stage 4 I think I will need to leave the house and head to my in-laws up north. It makes sense that the issue is a busted fuse if the rest of my neighbors are fully powered but I’m not."
The Woodlands. The ONLY place with restored power is Billionaire Road on North Shore. Nice
What the fuck is this lightning all about?
Hello thunder 😳
Did anyone else get an ominous message about “several days” from Centerpoint
"Just reading thru the latest Centerpoint excuses made me stop at this quote:

""“While we tracked the projected path, intensity and timing for Hurricane Beryl closely for many days, this storm proved the unpredictability of hurricanes as it delivered a powerful blow across our service territory and impacted a lot of lives,” said Lynnae Wilson, Senior Vice President, CenterPoint Energy. “We know we have important work ahead for our customers who depend on us, especially during the hot summer months.”

They tracked the hurricane for days and were STILL taken off guard... By a cat 1 storm.

Oh yeah, Tomball is still without power in my area. Though the businesses across the way seem to be doing just fine..."
Manifesting power coming back at midnight pleeeeease whatever entity can help my newborn needs some AC 🙏🏼🙏🏼

"77007. no power no water
Edit: rip got a text from centerpoint saying days"
77008 at 24th and Bevis - power just came back on
"77007- power out since 7:30 yesterday. Flickered on for a few minutes this morning and nothing since. 

I spoke to someone at centerpoint on the phone and she confirmed that it’s a “device” out in my area. I also told her I hadn’t gotten a single power alert this whole time and once I hung up I at least got some texts from them. One said they’d fixed the problem at my address (they hadn’t) and then another 20 minutes later saying they were aware of the problem lol.

ETA: Also no water since yesterday morning."
"Galveston, no power, 95 degrees in my place. I'm suffering, told it's going to be anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks 🥰🥰"
77006 by black hole. Still without power. My job down the street off dunlavy (77006) near common bond has power (no generator) and from what I know will be open tomorrow.
"77004, midtown by 288/McGovern
No power since 830 am yesterday. Haven’t seen a single work truck last night or this morning"
77008 Yale / 25th no power since 0930 yesterday. Just the sweet song of all the neighbors generators running constantly
77008 the Heights 21st and Yale. No power.
"77006, Montrose, near Anvil, we just got our power back on a little under an hour ago"
"New information about boiling water on OP.


PLEASE READ."
The tracker hasn’t updated for an hour. It’s 87 in the apartment and I am so scared for my cat. I just want some ac man that’s it
"Found this map to some what track where you might be in the queue for restoration https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195bcf03ae0c491f9f14bf77f2c43420

Seems like my section in 77584 near PJHS has been assigned for repair"
[deleted]
"At this point I think it’s safe to say that most of my area (Westbury/Meyerland) is still without power. We got out of the house a few times today and did not see a single business or gas station open other than HEB, and no Centerpoint trucks. 
If that’s the case all over town I’d say they’re nowhere close to their stated goal of 50% restoration by tomorrow. 🫤"
This thunder giving me PTSD right now
77096 near Chimney Rock and South Braeswood. Power still out. Lots of tree debris has been hauled to sides of road but had to dodge a dozen branches when I drove a 1 mile loop last night to check things out. Traffic signals are 100% dead.
"Anyone make the drive to Austin? How are the roads?

My parents are considering driving over to me in Austin since my mom is sick and not able to withstand the heat. They are in 77459 - no power since 2am yesterday."
77008 near heights high school - got an alert our power was restored from centerpoint but went to check house and circuit breakers. No luck. no one in the area has power. Ugh
77007 near Washington and Durham got power back
"Walked around SE end of 77009 yesterday and today, and its super disheartening to have not seen a single centerpoint truck in my neighborhood"
"Bullshit, most of everyone in my neighborhood got their power back but we didn't"
Added cooling center information
"77004, still no power. Going on 30 hours with no power. No signs of life/help have been spotted either"
77429 it is 93 degrees inside the house right now and is and the cats are showing early signs of heat stroke. This is ridiculous.
77007 Washington/Sawyer no power still.
"In laws just got power back in 77459, Sienna."
It says my area is green on that map but its still pitch darkness for me.
"Does center point have people working through the night, or do they eventually stop for the night and start in the morning?"
77008 and 77009 still out. A few houses look to have it back but not everyone else
"77057 house still without power but kid's daycare which is nearby reported they have power back. Hopefully that means crews are in the area, I haven't seen a single truck since the storm hit"
"77024, Hedwig Village, power is back"
"77006 still no power, going on 36 hours now. By black hole"
77006 in Midtown has power back (near the Camden's)
"In case anyone is wondering, CenterPoint is responsible for streetlight repair, and they have a portal to search by light number and report issues.

The one in front of my house was damaged in the Derecho, then damaged even worse during this storm, and I drove myself crazy trying to find streetlights on 311's site."
77006 Harold St near Graustark - just got power back!
"Just got an obvious scammer call about “any problems with my AT&T service.” If you have elderly family members that may fall for these scumbags trying to take advantage of vulnerable people at an even more vulnerable time, give them a call and warn them about scammers calling them. It may seem obvious to you, but it isn’t always to them."
Power came back in 77007 (west of yale/ south of 11th) about 30 minutes ago
77077 still no power. Cordless/battery operated fans might be a good investment in the future!!!
77042 - Finally got power back! We're at Beltway 8 and Briar Forest.
Pampered Pet Inn off Kirby and Bissonett had space to board more animals earlier when I was there. The house got up to 87 degrees and we had to pull the trigger and drop our pets off somewhere cool. Their phone lines are down so they will not respond to calls. Only emails.
"Not even Centerpoint’s tracker is updating since 7:45P and my account isn’t loading… wonderful. 

I keep seeing 77096 get restored but nothing for us here. Kids are getting very uncomfortable and we have 3 doggos sprawled on the floor 😣"
The outage map is up with color coded areas. Hope that means we get more answers
"77479, Sugar Land still out... and got a message from centerpoint stating expect late Wednesday to early Thursday for restored power......... sigh"
i’m curious if there’s a logistical reason that they won’t indicate which geographic areas they’re focusing on first. it would be nice to be able to make an informed decision  
This storm outta nowhere what the.
77092 still without power. Been that way since 9am yesterday.
Still nothing in 77009. A few places by Cavalcade and N. main do. But nothing yet in surrounding areas.
"77024 @ Memorial & Chimney Rock. Still no power since early AM yesterday. Haven’t heard an update from Centerpoint but there are teams clearing the branches and debris from the roads, so progress."
Still haven’t seen any CNP trucks anywhere in kingwood
"77009 Apartment complex across the street from me has power but the entire neighborhood behind it is out. 

Slowly going to need a 10 hour YouTube of generators in order to sleep."
77056 by the JW Marriot has power again!
"77004, midtown, 288/mcgowen. Still no power. This heat is gonna cook us. 

I have friend who lives by southmore and almeda with power out there as well"
77007 still no power
77004 - off of emancipation got power after it being gone since around 9am yesterday
Power just tuned on 77056 on Post oak
"77008 aurora / Yale crews on scene , several utility trucks. Positive sign"
77004 Museum District—power just came back on at 10:30 PM.
Accepted I may not get power till like Friday probably at this point. Anyone have ANY tips to cool down when trying to sleep. I’m all sticky and sweating profusely. My feet are on fire!
"Can't confirm, but apparently in the emails sent out by Centerpoint. They expect to have ""80% of households up and running by Sunday"". 

I could understand this with Ike, maybe even with that derecho storm which was pretty strong in a small area. 

But a Cat 1?"
"77006: No power still at 5:08am.  

Anyone know if the Metropolitan Multi-service Center was open/had power yesterday? 

Next time I hope to have a car. I should have hopped on a bus and left town Friday or Saturday night. I plan on getting a power cell, a cooler with wheels, and cold packs ASAP for my next hurricane survival kit. "
Just got power at 77007. Near Schuler and Knox.
"77056, Hyatt Houston Galleria. Every building across the street has power, but our hotel has even lost all emergency power. All hallways and stairways are shrouded in complete darkness, even during the day. No water nor AC. I was homeless in Phoenix at one point and am doing okay, but some of these people aren't. No hot meals since yesterday's hotel breakfast before the hurricane cut the power at 9am. We have loose powerlines all over the sidewalks and some across the road."
77019 (River Oaks) is still without power since yesterday morning. Not surprising - we have a lot of old trees in the neighborhood that came down. But I can attest that the rumors that we've been receiving preferential treatment are untrue. The folks who still have power are because they have generators.
77006 (midtown) still no power since 6am yesterday. Kinda frustrating seeing some of the other apartment complexes and shopping centers (On the Kirb area) have power since yesterday but my complex doesn’t. Praying this power comes on soon its getting miserable.
77007 Rice Military near Memorial and Waugh. No power since 7 am yesterday.
"77433/bridgeland

My pocket section of the neighborhood has power (got at 2p yesterday) but a lot do not. We sustained minor roof damage (some lifted shingles) so I’m having to get someone out for that.

My in laws generator failed yesterday at 6a even though it was just serviced. They can’t get a hold of the people who serviced it (for $1500…ouch!) so they’re headed over here with cats in tow to stay as long as they need to. My dad is in the hospital up in Pennsylvania today, to add to the stress level, but hopefully he will be okay. Waiting for them to get him sorted out and will check on him in a bit. I can’t really travel due to being 33 weeks pregnant (a lot of airlines will cut you off at 34-36 weeks) unless it’s like severe in which case I’ll have to figure it out.

I’m fortunate we are okay, but trying to keep my stress levels low for the sake of the baby and my pets. The pets will be happy to see the in-laws for a while."
"Guys, any CVS pharmacy open near Sugarland ? I need to get three day loaner meds. Doctors office closed."
"77019 near the Whole Foods

Power is on, and the Whole Foods is open"
"77058 no power but PSA if you have an apartment garage like me and the only way to get in is through the roll door, there may be what looks like a peep hole that is actually a string to the latch you can pull down and that will let you raise the door. Stay cool everyone"
"77498, got power back about 30 mins ago"
77584: just came back on line
Downloaded the Whataburger app and yeah still no power in my neck of the woods. I’m going home to sit in a sauna. …fun
"Got an email from CenterPoint saying power issue resolved and my meter is showing as power on on centerpoints website, but we still have no power. Should I report a continued outage? Or will my power likely turn back on soon."
77006 Midtown Bagby/Helena St apartments power restored thank the lord 🙏🏽 wishing everyone the same soon
77401 entire neighborhood restored besides my one street doesn’t seem like a good sign 🤡
"77407 - Still no power. Cell service kicked back in about an hour ago, so hopefully that’s a good sign.  

FYI - I got my AC running off the generator finally after installing a Turbo Air Easy Start. It’s the opposite of the newly popular soft starts.  It basically dumps a huge charge to kick start your unit so quickly it shouldn’t trip the breaker(Also known as a Hard Start).  I work for an HVAC distributor and we had at least 10 in stock at my location still.  If you need one, lmk and I’ll send you info where to pick it up. Very easy to connect.

"77042, Wilcrest and Westpark and Walnut and Richmond area, no electricity in the nearby apartments, however, public lights, traffic lights and even lights for bus stops are working so I hope we get power soon. I have read earlier that someone in our Zip-code got electricity a couple hours ago"
77379 just got power like 2 mins ago!!!!
77007 was just driving around to charge my phone and power came back on about 5 mins ago literally as I was walking through the door.
77089. Left for San Antonio yesterday and trying to convince my girlfriend we should just stay there forever and never come back. I think the power is on because I can see my thermostat is online.
can someone with actual knowledge help me understand  the power outage issues & why the response time is slow? is it all centerpoints fault? is it our govt? is it bc hurricanes are devasting? what're the cause of the power issue & how can we fix it ?
"77546, no power since yesterday morning. Got about 2hrs of sleep and now back up again..... gonna be a long ass day"
77004 - 24 hours without power. the whole area near me is still pretty dark. not looking forward to sunrise
"77070 still no power, T-Mobile data not working very well still"

"77031 - half the neighborhood got power last night. My half is still out. The dividing line is my street, so of course the neighbors across from me all have power now."
"77092 power just came on    
24 hrs for beryl vs 2.5 days for the derecho"
77043 Spring Branch. No power since 5am Monday. Not getting my hopes up either since our area is usually one of the last to get fixed.
77459 still no power. Hearing people in sugar land have gotten power as early as 9am.
"I'm in 77054, east of NRG, and power just came back at 9:45 am."
"Anyone know any restaurants/lounges with available wifi and power to work from? I know this may be a long shot, but in the westchase/energy corridor area?"
"77077 still out in half the neighborhood. Kept seeing transformers arc and spark last night but nothing [good] came of it. The other half of our neighborhood never loses power. Truly. Not during any storm we have had in the 7 years I’ve lived here including Harvey. Meanwhile, our side of the street is one stiff breeze away from darkness at all times."
"77004 no power since 9am yesterday. T-mobile can kiss my ass. Also, center point said they were bring in 11,000 workers? Where the hell are they?"
"Still no power or water at 77096, I’ve seen some people reporting they’re getting electricity back at 77096 (info from the ring app)"
"77598, still not a lick of licktricity, and I haven’t seen any of the centerpoint bucket boys around here. The taco truck across the street is open and fucking delicious, and I’m trying to decide if it’s a smart idea to eat spicy food in an apartment without AC"
How am I supposed to know if I’m in MUD 421 and need to boil water? Why is it impossible to google the boundaries of a MUD and get a quick map?
"Reporting live from 77096 S. Braeswood @ Frankway Dr. (Behind Lowe’s in Meyerland) 

Power came back for 3 glorious seconds. It’s gone again.

I noticed workers on street are working on lines. Their trucks didn’t have CP’s logos though. Idk my guess is out of town support. Interesante.

UPDATE: Spotted a few CNP F150s too. 

- BalconyHawk"
I’m guessing there’s going to be a legal food fight that we start hearing about in a few days. The city and center point have to cooperate for now but I’m guessing there’s tension

77008 - 290 and 610 area has power.

Found a few packs at the Washington HEB.

Also found a sandwich. Store is wide open and deli has food."
Has anyone in the Spring area heard anything at all?? Was hoping they’d get to that substation today
"77030 Kirby/West Holcombe, no power since Sunday 5:00 am"
"77019, North Montrose, power still out.  Along West Dallas near Rochow, I see a tree leaning heavily on a power line that feeds our area.  The tree is on property owned by the owners of the Allen House and Sovereign apartments.  If any residents are on this thread, I would be curious to know if their property manager is trying to expedite restoration by hiring a tree removal professional."
77018 by Washington High just got power!
"77021 
No power as of 2:30pm, but Centerpoint updated at 1:49pm that power was restored - I’m assuming they fixed a larger issue upstream and will need to address various smaller issues around the area to get everyone back up and running."

Power back at 77505 Pasadena

What does “circuits assigned for repair” mean on the new outage map? There aren’t a ton of places that have that (it’s blue colored) so I have no idea what that means.
"All I can say is if you have a gas line or a propane tank, if you are able to afford the 5 to $8,000 for the Generac generator costs and installation, I would strongly suggest getting one.  Sad thing is that there is going to be a huge demand in the next few months.  My parents and brother got one where they live in The Woodlands.  The main power has gone off nearly a dozen times, but each time the generator turns on after 20 seconds and does its job.  If you can afford it and if your house can handle the setup, again I strongly suggests purchasing one especially since the Houston area has those inclement weather like you saw yesterday."
77064  West Rd area just came back

"Just in from the press conference: Mayor Whitmere to sell autographed vapes to pay for the city’s impending lawsuit against centrepoint. Linemen crews expirenced in working with 3rd world electrical infrastructure are being brought in from tijiuana. Centerpoint started calling crews basically as the storm was over the city. That’s why there was nothing on their feed for 4 hours. They were two days behind calling other crews. Normally they need a full 2 days to get a full staging ready. This time, the staging didn’t start until the eye was over the city and it was raining buckets."
77051 got it at about 15:15ish. That was  about 5 mins after Centerpoint sent us a text telling us it was going to be several days
"What happens if it rains, does centerpoint wait at ojos locos?"
"77018 Yale and 39th basically. No power still since 6am yesterday, *but* I have neighbors across the street and on adjacent blocks who have it. Not sure if they never lost or have recovered."

Power came back at 3am last night. Praying that rest of y’all get yours quick as well."
"77005, power came back, but since they didn't remove the tree.from the lines, it caused a small fire. Transformer blew again, and fire went out eventually on its own, so now I assume it'll be weeks before.someone comes to fix it."

"If you're looking for a portable generator for next time inverter generators are the best for electronics, fridges, etc but tend to cost more and have less output. For regular generators you will want line conditioners or a UPS that conditions power for anything that is plugged in that has a chip inside (almost anything other than say a water pump). 

Generator extension cords, the longer the cord, the thicker wire needed, the more they cost. Do not get a 50 foot cord that isn't the right gauge. The extension cord should be expensive, don't get cheap.

Get a lockout panel or generator bypass installed on your house asap. It will pay for itself when you factor in your food and sanity."

But my 5 year old has had an extremely bad mucus cough for the last two days that the normal OTC meds aren't working on. So we will be making a journey to find an open urgent care this morning. 

As far as I know my hospital is still without power in the Woodlands so all outpatient is suspended, so at least I don't have work."
"77338--still no power since 4a yesterday. 

I definitely recommend investing in heavy duty battery banks and battery-operated fans if you haven't. We've been collecting and improving since the ice storm a few years ago and can now more less continue as comfortably as one can. Especially if you plan on staying in Houston, or TX in general."

Not a big deal if I miss them, I can still burn what they can’t get… but I’d rather just have it all at street side for pickup when they come by."

"So. This rain is just glorious. We currently have a generator running outside and covered it with two huge tv boxes. The exhaust end is fully open to vent but is still protected from water getting in it. I’m totally freaking out. This is our lifeline to our fridge and our portable AC unit. If it goes out I don’t know what we are going to do. I’m literally on the verge of a major anxiety attack. Advice would be helpful.

I drove around and it looks like a good portion of the area south of me on Veterans Memorial is back up, so hopefully they working their way up here. Last time the power went out, I called CP to get an estimate on restoration, and they literally had it back on in 5 minutes after I called. I will say my house did the ""three cycle"" before going dark, so maybe there is a chance it can be turned on remotely again. About to call CP. "

"77041, no power but we are just a small section without it, all are surrounding neighbors have it. Our fear is they are going to ignore us for awhile."
All of my posts get removed by mod…not sure why but can anyone point me in the right place to buy a generator? How does every store say they have them online and then sold out when you get there? 
"So, it shows we’re set for repairs in the map, but also that the circuits are “energized” when it used to not say that, but we still don’t have power. Anyone know how to make sense of this thing?"
"77302. 1314/Porter road. They sent out a survey crew for our downed lines yesterday early in the day. Not seen a single utility crew here or anywhere near here.

Power company said they dispatched 1300 work crews. Where are they? Hardly anybody has seen a utility truck

They also said they are working day and night which is a lie so blatant, I'm surprised it didn't bust their teeth coming out they mouth. If they were working day and night then a linemen crew would have been out here yesterday within an hour of the survey crew and we'd all have power out here already.

They are just straight up lieing and purposely not helping us to really draw out as much of the governments money as they can.

One of the most annoying things though?

One house has power out here and that neighbor is the reason all the rest of us behind them don't have power. They left a bunch of Dead trees in their yard. Nearly six large ones, all next to the powerlines. As you may have guessed, one of their dead trees feel on our lines and yet THEY still have power and I mean actual power. No generator noise at all and even the front fence lights of theirs are on.

Worst part is that our part of the grid is ready for power, they just haven't decided to stop being lazy and actually hook our lines back up. Y'all know if it was their neighborhood they would be working off the clock to restore power themselves, for themselves

UPDATE : Just had a second survey crew out here. Except this one ACTUALLY looked around this time and came to get information from people. First one was all grey, took a quick look around and drove off without a single word. This second one was all white and actually had an Entergy logo on it.

Second survey truck means 0 communication between workers or crews and company as all our neighbors have stated EXACTLY what the issue is and where, in great detail and still a second survey truck was sent instead of a linemen crew. I really can't say I'm surprised as every single job I've worked is the same way with a horrendous lack of communication. 

Same story, different day, all across America. If you're not from America and you're thinking of moving here... Don't. Pick a European country 

(Not the UK because they are just as bad off as us)

or a country nobody has ever heard of. You'll be much happier"

"I don't think this is a Category 1 Hurricane, we have a big trees who survive decades of Hurricane and now it got knockoff like it was nothing, my guestimate wind that hit our area is 120mph max. Why the media don't report the real power of this hurricane to people? worried about mass panic?"

Finally a post not complaining about THEIR area not being tended to immediately. Good info
"Just drove home. Whataburger has another mile long 3 hour line for burgers from the dumbest people on the planet. 

These people cant survive without fast food.  It has been 24 hours and they are crazy."
People really be dramatic with this Whataburger.
