77011 - still out. Caved and got a generator & a window unit & a mini fridge yesterday. My bedroom is now my tiny dorm. 😂
"Reminder:  

Don't be in a hurry to fully restock your fridge."
"77057 Woodway and Voss - is today the day? Who even knows. I don’t know if CP gave up on us or what. Feels like my lights and AC will never come back. And then the other part of me is like if I can go almost a week without power in Houston in the summer, I can do anything😂"
Day fucking 7 without power. The people right across the street from me got power back on Thursday....
77008 no power - CenterPoint refuses to send anyone.  I hate this company with the fire of a thousand suns
"Reporting, once again, from the sweltering heat of 77007. Current restoration estimates say Monday. I am losing my mind."

"I called 'Time of death' on my generator at noon yesterday after trouble shooting all morning (carburetor is clean/unplugged,  not overfilled with oil/gas).  I took my super grungy self to Lowes and blew a cool grand on a duel fuel generator.  Came back home.  Got it set up and running by 3ish.  Power came on at 8PM.....at least I'm ready for the next one.  "
77345 back of Kingwood.  100kish without power in greater humble.   I would be stunned if the Tuesday estimate is met for my street.
"I’m pretty discouraged about getting my power back anytime soon. Someone stole the breaker box off of my house and I already had bad tree damage, it’s a rental house and the landlord isn’t very good about repairs. Can’t even get a reply "
"Posting again because wtf else am I gonna do with my day off without power?  77092 at Antoine and 43rd.  Still no power.  We got an arbitrary date on the map, but judging by what else has been said in these threads I’m not holding my breath.  I would leave if I could, but three animals and nowhere else I can go plus I can’t afford to miss work.  I’m exhausted, tired, threw my back out yesterday, at least was able to borrow my parents generator and can run it through the night for me and my neighbor to be able to have a fan while we sleep but am outta money to keep the thing fed.  I tried to apply for FEMA aid but got an identity error so no luck there yet.   Just moved here in April and really regret that decision so far."
"77035, we’re in a nested outrage (pun intended) of only 3 houses."
So basically CP has blanket email going out and saying 19th lmao. Fuck this company
77077 we got power back for 10 mins and now gone. I cannot do this anymore. I’m losing my mind
There’s far more than 461K “customers” without power. A conservative low headcount is probably close to 1.5MM
"77076 nested outage, I haven't seen any movement by Centerpoint around. I'm just like ""whatever"" now."
77007 Wescott/Washington power back last night
"My in-laws (and their cats) are going on nearly a week of living with us. Their place at 77069 (champions area) finally has an ETA of the 17th so we’ll see if that holds true. It’s at least calmed my mother-in-law down and made her a bit less crazy forgetful so I’ll take it. Their place in 77554 (past Jamaica beach where it is back to being Galveston) is actually slated to be online today so we’ll see if that is true. Their place there sustained roof damage, but the roofers found the roof is repairable, which at $1500 to repair it versus $29000 for a new roof…is pretty damn amazing.

Both of my in-laws are sick, but I thankfully haven’t caught it which is pretty good since I’m pregnant and have a weaker immune system. My mother-in-law wants to help me with housework everyday but I’m just like nah, im good. Touch as little as possible. I’m gonna have to sanitize spray the house down many times after they leave to feel comfortable."
77007 trucks in our area on blossom/patterson.
"77066, still no power. And now CP is taking about ""nested outages"" that could take extra time to repair.  Great 🙄 Blessed to be in the little 1/4 mile spot with no power while everyone else around the area is fine. "
"77396

Still no power but crews have been in neighborhood since 11am today.

I spoke to them briefly and essentially, he told me that they are stuck until a certain machine arrives to put the power back on the entire neighborhood .

The crew is from Ohio and they’ve been waiting here all day for the machine to show up and it hasn’t .

I asked him what the holdup was and he just blatantly told me centerpoint. They don’t know where the machine is and they don’t know when they will arrive. 

So great I’m stuck without power for another day, because Centerpoint doesn’t know where the machines are ….."
"77521, Baytown. Line is still down at the end of my street (one house away from me). I still have not seen anyone come and even point their eyes at it. 

CP map shows my neighborhood as energized. I've received zero updates from CP PAS. 

I reported the outage again today. That will achieve... well nothing probably. 

Borrowed a small generator from work, but I don't have the money to keep filling it up and also eat and also put gas in my car, etc.

Filled out the FEMA stuff yesterday to try and recoup some of the money I've wasted because of this, and was flatly denied. 

I have zero hope at this point. I have a dog and seven cats I'm obligated to, so I can't just up and leave. I also have aquariums that are going to crash soon without filtration. 

My mother is in hospice in Jasper, because all the hospitals here are full, and I can't afford to go see her. 

I hate this fucking state. I hate CenterPoint. I've been left here to die and nobody gives a shit."
"This power outage is gonna outlast the number of puns you can come up with.

On the power outage map my area has NO color over it.  TF does that mean?"

Power back for 30 minutes then off … 😃
My nested outrage was just fixed at tc jester and North of i10 77007
"Reminder:

1.  Check the main post often for new information. 


2. Don't be in a hurry to completely restock your refrigerator once you get power. 


3. Think about your placement of your generator.

4. For the sake of your sanity and overall well-being, get out of the house and socialize with friends, or simply go out.

Lost power at 827 AM Monday. Restored Sunday at 1:22 PM. Much love to the out of state guys who came and restored our nested outage after a couple neighbors flagged them down. They got a well earned assortment of shitty light beer from me.

77096. No power. Near Herod.
"77069 no power. We saw a bunch of utility trucks though. My husband talked to them and we *may* get power by the end of the day.Supposedly they were having formans going through the area. It’s insulting that the centerpoint map shows our neighborhood is energized, but yet I’m still sitting in a very hot house and no electricity.

As much as I appreciate my neighbors hospitality, I can’t wait to sleep in my own bed."
"I got power back Thursday night, thank god. Something I didn’t consider was my doctor sending in a prescription renewal to my usual Walgreens, which still doesn’t have power, and I 
 can’t transfer it to another Walgreen’s location without having the doc send in a whole new renewal to that location.  

I’m sitting here wondering if it’s worth the hassle to call my doctor and get them to help or just wait it out. It’s the Walgreens at Shepherd & Feagan, which is in the light green on the map. I’ve got some extra meds and it’s not a life or death medical issue so I’m very lucky in that regard. I feel like a real dummy for not thinking of this when I requested the renewal in the first place."

Lots and lots of Bucket Trucks in and around my neighborhood! 5 were staged in the little league field.  Hopefully we get power in the next few hours."
77379- across from Klein high school. Power turned on this morning!!! Hallelujah
"An update for my 77092 peeps near 43rd, TC Jester and Watonga. I drove by our house and saw a couple of vegetation crews at the corner of 43rd and Watonga gearing up to work on a big tree that was leaning against a power line right there at the corner. I didn't see any huge damage to the pole itself but I have an untrained eye. Hopefully that was one of the only big holdups for people in our area. Obviously Centerpoint needs to come by after that to do their thing but it's a sign of progress.

Edit: Had some friends drive by to check. Trees on the corner have been trimmed and they said they saw work trucks near Viking and Mall, not sure if Centerpoint or otherwise. Hopefully that brings some hope to some of yall!"
77007. North of I-10 and TC jester. Had power for a day and then it went out again Thursday.. other houses on our street have power but we and some others of our closest neighbors don’t. I’ve been pretty patient but the anger is starting to set in
77379- nothing since the hurricane and not projected to have power until Tuesday. Sigh.
77379 - still no power. Map said the 17th yesterday but now says energized. I am definitely not energized.

77090 still now power and I am loosing my fckin mind
"77009 - My power was supposed to be on the 12th, then the 13th, then today. We had linemen 8 blocks south of us yesterday and now they're nowhere to be fine. Centerpoint's map shows us as ""energized with localized outages"" which is straight bullshit because there are 60 or so houses out because of this one downed line and transformer. I've fucking had it with centerpoint. They're a scam of a company that's forced on us with no competition at all. A monopoly beholden only to its shareholders. 

When I called again today, they contacted dispatch and basically said ""yeah we don't know when we'll get to that"". Fuck centerpoint."
"77018- We are listed as energized with potential nested outages, our community  and surrounding areas do not have power.  We were walking the neighborhood and saw two trucks at a house, the minute a droplet of rain went down they got the hell out of dodge.

Crews continue to focus on restoring power. We understand your frustration and we apologize for the lack of specific restoration times. Your area has been identified as one with more localized, isolated outages. Based on the status of active restoration work, we estimate your power to be restored by the end of the day, Friday, July 19. Please know, however, that restorations will be happening daily and you may be restored earlier. We will communicate any updates as that information becomes available.

" Day 7 of no power

Yesterday I finally got sick and tired of it and tried to drum up a little mini-campaign to get a tree off a power line. I know at least 5 of us were calling repeatedly yesterday, maybe more. Initially when speaking to Centerpoint, they said they didn’t have a crew available to cut the tree down and didn’t know when they would but they were aware of it… fishy. I called back and asked for updates a few more times yesterday to keep the heat on them, and then later that evening we finally had an ETA of 7/16 on getting power back. Bummer that it was going to be three more days, but I was happy to have anything other than “pending”. 

Wouldn’t you know it, there are ten trucks out there this morning and the tree is being dealt with. 

All of this to say, don’t underestimate the power of multiple people calling and keeping pressure on them to prioritize your area. Try to get your neighbors to call multiple times. Make sure you mention if your issue is affecting a school or a public park where kids might spend time. Don’t give up!

**Update**: we have power!! Advocate for yourselves people!!"
"77373 spring, by Kroger treaschwig... no power.. still.. 😕"
77030 near Hermann park no power
77018 no power by alba and wakefield. our neighbor got a call last night saying we’re looking at getting power back the 18th which is better than what we were looking at before - nothing. still a real bitch though
77098- nada
In Meyer Forest Apartments 4 of the 12 buildings do not have power. The other 8 do. I’m in one of the 4. Hopefully it’s fixed before the heat returns.

77009 near Montie Beach park. Map says we are energized. Neighbors have power but I guess the 3 blocks behind them including me do not have power. I’ve seen box trucks around the neighborhood all day today but I still can’t get my hopes up. I’m tired y’all.
77037… July 19th… who do I sue?
"No power still but I was able to refill 2 of my propane tanks at Northtown Auto Center on Shepherd.  $12 for each 20lb tank.  There was a massive propane tanker delivering when I got there and no one waiting so I was in and out in like 5 minutes.  They close at 5 today if anyone needs some.  Shepherd wasn't bad traffic wise, most of the lights are working"
Got the message that power's back on at work and as much as I'd love to take advantage of the electricity and AC over there I don't think I'm capable of doing anything but staring at a wall so now I guess I have to decide if I really want to waste PTO just to sit in the heat with no power 🫠
My neighborhood of the outskirts on the edge of oak Forest just got electricity
"77024 and still now power despite estimates that it would be back last night. 

Centerpoint needs to be broken up or nationalized immediately. Going on a full week without power after a Cat 1 is an inexcusable level of incompetence. These idiots couldn’t manage a hot dog stand. "
Hermann Park area: had power restored Wednesday afternoon but lost power about an hour and am in the dark now 😁

My power is flapping on and off. Not touching the AC breakers until it stabilizes.
"As always, thanks for all your help and coordination, pervert!"
"77068 - Northgate area got power about an hour ago! Our friends there are letting us hang out in a spare room overnight, so hopefully all y'all will have a comfortable place to rest. We're in Hargrave area in 77069 and apparently there's a big tree that broke the lines, and nothing has been done there. Oof."
77081 near hillcroft has power!
77039- our lights flickered about 3-4 times and are now off again...
When is end of day for centerpoint? It is 7:30 and they still haven’t restored our power but on the map it says by eod today.

"Only 1000 people restored last night, enough to say they work past 6pm"
77007. Birdsall st. Still nothing. No color on the map either
"77024 Hunter's Creek Village. Got it back yesterday a little before 6 pm. We were slated for yesterday, so I am glad they were able to actually do it. 

My in-laws live off Mockingbird and Flintrock in Bunker Hill Village. We have offered them to come over, but they say they don't want to impose. They have a gnarly tree that is still down, and Centerpoint has told them it could be weeks because of how bad the trees and lines are. It requires a special team to come out. The Village police and fire have needed to put out notices because residents keep coming into the stations and fire houses asking when they are going to do anything. People, if the lines are live, people can die. Don't harass others or try to do it yourself.  Sadly, a lot of this has become hurry up and wait and a lack of transparency from Centerpoint, yet again. 

If you go out in public today, don't be an asshole. 

EDIT: In speaking to my MIL this morning, they are now being told Tuesday."
"I've had power for a few days. Just got a call from Centerpoint saying that ours was an especially challenging issue and we would not get power back until next Friday. 
 
AI is not ready for prime time, folks."
77068 nested outage. Don't see any trucks working in my neighborhood anymore so losing hope here :(
"77037, no power and the Centerpoint map suggests it'll be Friday before it's restored. Even then, I have two large branches on my service line, so will probably have a nested outage once the power comes back. 

Hoping the house doesn't catch fire like the other guys did"
77037- still without power
"77075 South Hobby- still nothing, but staring at neighbors who's lights have been on for 4 days... 

Did anyone else get an email from CenterPoint about checking your weatherheads? It's this only other correspondence I've gotten since end of day on the 12th and it feels like such a blame shift cop out."

77388 Cypresswood near 45. Power just came on about 10 minutes ago. It’s been a journey. Best wishes to everyone who is still waiting.

"For those of you seeing the map claiming you're energized when you don't have power, give the map a bit more time to load and you may see the color change. I opened the map a bit earlier to look and it said I was energized despite not having power. I was staring at it in furious disbelief and then decided to take a screenshot to send to my friends to complain. In the minute or two it took me to decide that, the map changed and said I would be up on 7/17. So I think it's just really laggy to load when zooming in."

I told them it probably was false since they didn’t get a notification. They drove over there and still had no power. So they are now even more disappointed. Hopefully it’ll be back on by Wednesday or before."
77053 our electricity went out...
Anyone in the meyer forest apartment complex on 77096 got any updates as far as when power will be back or seen any trucks heading that way?
Hope the cleanup is going well and productive. I’m probably visiting in a few weeks.
77008 Any info on W.26 and Lawrence? Looks like every one around that area has power but not our area
77080 finally back on for now.
"77006, near Montrose/Bomar. Got power around 6:30pm today."
"77074 altamond sangamon ln our entire neighborhood has power except us(10-20 houses), we should be in the nested area and I pretty sure they forgot about us… 

This is really depressing especially when you see your neighbors has light and you don’t….

Fun facts, I called center point about my outage and the live call lady hung up on me after I gave my address. I don’t even know what to say anymore lmao…"
77345 they claim my area is energized but nothing in the general surrounding apartment complexes or businesses (until further down West Lake Houston) have power.
"77036. Finally have power back at Forum Park. That was a long week. Fuck Centerpoint. Fuck Greg Abbott. Fuck Dan Patrick. Fuck the crosswinds in Butler, Pennsylvania"
Live in the Greenspoint Service area. We’re the only area with over 100k remaining without power. Fucking sucks
"77026

Power back online. However it seems to be “pulsing” on and off certain hours of the day. This shuts off the A/C and router repeatedly. The most it happened was 4 times in one hour. Is this an area issue or could it be personal home issue/our power lines on street?"
"77389 Northhamptom FINALLY has Power and the sweet, sweet taste of the Internet.  I'm gonna hurt myself with the amount of porn I'm going to watch."
Mattress Mack getting after Centerpointless. Love to see it.
"77459

At this point I give up, they shifted the date so many times, I'm certain that they wont be done til august. I'm not waiting that long. At this point I'm just going to skip town. I've been putting it off for a while, but living in a situation that is essentially a third world scenario has put me in a position where I would have no chance.

this stinking city and state has taken everything, my life, my health, my dignity. left me with nothing. and now they have put me in a position where a fucking thunderstorm leaves me in the dark for a whole fucking week. 

fuck it, I got nothing to lose."
I’m never getting power back.  Parts of shepherd are pitch black at night including a whattaburger and Centerpoint told us to eat cake
"77021, near Scott and OST. We are lucky in that we have had “partial service” since Monday, so we’ve been able to charge devices, have the fridge available, run fans, and power a portable A/C unit for the bedroom. Of course, the A/C system is one of the things offline and even with fans and such the air in the house is getting very stuffy and humid. We’ve been able to keep the temp in the 80s in the house by opening windows overnight, which has definitely helped.

Our whole side of the block and the homes backing up to us on the next block over are in the same situation with limited power and no A/C.

A CenterPoint technician was across the street yesterday to address a downed live wire and stopped by real quick to check the lines when we mentioned the issue. He confirmed that the 120V phase was running but the 240V was only pushing about 98V, hence the issue. He speculated that it was a transformer issue or some other problem in the line running behind our house.

He said that it was a “low priority” issue with other repairs underway even though the whole side of the street was affected, which I honestly understand but is frustrating. My biggest concern is that our situation is at super low priority and could take longer to address.

Big shout out to the technicians and linemen working to get everything back online. CenterPoint’s bungling of this emergency response is out of their hands, and I’m sure many of them are frustrated with the situation as well."
"77004, midtown, 288/McGowen

No power even though the map said it would be fixed yesterday"
"There is no power for us at 77042 after 2 days of half of my complex getting power. I want to scream, 7 days away from home, living out of a suitcase, I feel like a burden."
"77099 here. Got power back Wednesday night, but lost it yesterday around noon, and still out now. What’s up with that? 😑"
77070 Louetta & Cutten. Power was supposed to be on YESTERDAY! But still nothing. It’s hot and miserable.
"No power here. But, across the street? Yes, we are on separate feeds and our power comes from rear of the property between yards. Fucking sucks ass. Day 7. Abbot is speaking today, time for a good protest against the little piss baby."
"77571 - Still powered up but I couldn't sleep last night to enjoy it. The generators been off since 11am yesterday and I can still hear it when I close my eyes. Got an email late last night saying Centerpoint may need access to my yard to fix a neighbors isolated outage.

I am keeping all the emergency supplies in place and a new generator being delivered Monday so I have two gennys and two AC's. They will never do this to me again."
77044- no power
"Still have a down live line. Still no one even assigned to it. We are very fortunate to be in a hotel for now, but not sure for how long. The thought of facing another week with no end in sight and also now having to be at work every day and meet deadlines is already so exhausting after a full week of heightened sense of anxiety and fight or flight. Hope everyone gets their power (and lives) back soon."
77336 atasocita/ lost power Monday got it back Tuesday morning/ map says we have no power
"77070 8 of the complex buildings and all surrounding ones got power back yesterday morning, centerpoint map says we all will get power on 17th lol."

77030 days my apartment building has power but it doesn’t
77055 had a end of the day noticed but they changed it to pending after 6 hours of having so you know. Quite accurate on that part.

"77584, Southdown with nested outage again! At this point I'm losing hope"
"77074 Bellaire/ tarneff area, we're still without power. It's extremely infuriating, and there is nothing we can do. I least I got a generator yesterday and we got fans running."
77039 lights are back on for now

"77346, no power since 5:30am last Monday. No real eta"
77077 no power yet but trucks in the neighborhood.  Map went from showing Tuesday restoration to “energized with potentially local outages.”  Not holding my breath.  They actually had it back on Thursday but then a transformer got hit by lightning when the storm rolled through and right back off again within 30 minutes.
77346: Atascocita South neighborhood just got power.
"77373 - Fairfax Village - No power since Monday 0630.

I've temporarily relocated to Brenham and I come down to check the house every couple of days. Thoroughly annoyed with Centerpoint and their outage map."

Nested outage 77082 whole apt has power but 6 buildings.  Called CP last night and was told power would be on last night. Still nothing.

77064 - still no power. West/bw8
"77023: no power; Pearson and Broadmoor. 

Half the houses have power the others do not. Map says we are energized. Real worried this will last til next Friday

Edit: Saw no linemen in my area today after having seen 6 or so around Scott rd and one on telephone and Dumble. They may be assigned elsewhere


**EDIT2**: power restored at 8pm today. Saw no linemen at all in the area, what causes this outage? It seems so bizarre. Out of 12 homes, 4 homes in a row were knocked out while everything else was powered."
What does it mean if a crew has been assigned to our area? Not sure if that’s good/bad/meh
77084 park row is sitting in the dark in a nested outage. Awful.
Just go down to your local federal government to get help.
