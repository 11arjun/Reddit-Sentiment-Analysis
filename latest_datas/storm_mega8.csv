"Honestly, most of these power outages would have never happened if Centerpoint did some type of tree maintenance around powerlines

Their lack of maintenance on powerlines caused this whole issue"
that elderly woman dying alone in her apartment and only found because of a wellness check was heart breaking.
"77055 - The forecasted restoration date is 7/19, for 11.5 days without power on the street. During the derecho we were out of power for 6 days. We also lost power from a regular old storm for half a day in between. 

By 7/19, day 201 of the year, we'll have 18 days without power here, ~9% of the year so far, putting my address slightly behind the averages of Botswana and Yemen. 

Or from the other direction, Centerpoint has only provided uptime 91% of the year."
"I just wanted to say that rumors on local social media (e.g., Nextdoor, Ring) being more accurate than info provided by CP is ridiculous. Also, people having to ask linemen directly for information on their outage also speaks volumes to the lack of coherence and transparency at CP.

My heart is with everyone who still doesn't have power!!"
"77521, Baytown. Still no power, still no email or text from CenterPoint, still no sign of any workers to even assess my neighborhood. 

CP map still shows that we're energized, but we still aren't. 

I have to go back to work today, and will have to leave my pets at home in the heat. I've run the generator all night to try and get the house as cool as I can, but even if I leave it on when I leave for work, it'll only run another hour or two before it runs out of gas. 

The fact is, this is not sustainable. It's not fun or ""let's come together"" or kumbaya, it's criminal. This is cruelty. 

To not even get a fucking email from CenterPoint is beyond unacceptable. 

I'm seeing other people are being told the 19th, hopefully that's a worst case scenario, but seeing as how my neighborhood hasn't even been acknowledged, I have zero hope."

"77007, live downed wire affecting 5 homes, day 8, neighbors & I been calling Centerpoint every day

Pregnant wife, no power, no estimate, no hope in sight."
77011 - got the text last night telling us it would be Friday when we get power back. Xfinity text me telling me they‚Äôre going to start throttling my data and their help line doesn‚Äôt work. So everything is going great over here.
"77098 - Harold and Hazard, just got power back. Also received the email last night saying power won't be back until Friday, yet it kicked on just a few minutes ago. More confirmation that the ""Friday July 19"" messaging was just a blanket generalization. Hoping everything is restored much quicker (but not betting on it...)."
77023. No power. No internet. Can‚Äôt leave the house due to looting in my neighborhood. It will be like this until Friday according to CenterPoint. Being tied to my home for 12 days feels like Covid all over again. Depressed.
77339 - still nada. Does CNP think changing colors on the map is going to make us feel better?
77092. Still a whole lot of fucking nothing.
"77008, Centerpoint is waiting on a homeowner who refuses to take action on a tree in his yard that's leaning against the power pole.  We've all talked to him and he is convinced that the city should take it down for him."
"Idk if this will help anyone, but I got an email and call from CenterPoint telling me that due to my area being ‚Äúlocalized, isolated outages‚Äù, my estimated restoration was supposed to be Friday by the end of the day. Not even 15 minutes after I got that message, our power finally came back on."
"77066 - Monday 7/15 - Still out, and the map says by end of day Wednesday, still.

I think a big part of the problem, right in the middle of the purple section on our map, is [this pole that's down](https://i.imgur.com/Nj67JQP.jpg) near the Tim Horton's at Richie and Bammel N. Houston.

I have to go to work today and leave the house on generator power, but sure hope someone sees them starting to do some work on this pole today. It's not a simple one because there are underground conduit runs involved, but it'll obviously have to be fixed before a lot of us get power back."
Anyone in Oak Forest 77018 still out of power?
"77007 Heights. LOST POWER AGAIN today at 5:30pm after being restored Saturday night. No explanation, no estimate, no linemen in the area. 

I just finished deep cleaning the nasty fridge and restocking with essentials after putting kids to bed last night.  I can‚Äôt keep doing this."
77077 part of the nestled outage. No hope
"77066 (12:30pm) Still dark, BUT on my way home for lunch I finally saw crews actively working on the downed lines that I highly believe will restore the power to my complex and surrounding businesses, stoplights, and subdivision. I sure hope so, had to return to work today, so couldn't keep windows open at home and it is almost 90¬∞ in my unit. I'm taking my cat with me for the rest of the work shift, but hopefully lights are on when we get home later this evening.¬†"
"spring branch by antoine & long point, got power back. fuck CP -- burn in hell."
77098 - no power from my house on Harold to the The Phoenix on Westheimer - which is OPEN w/ limited menu running via generator...FYI
77373 spring by Kroger treaschwig... everyone around me is energized but apparently we're not getting power till eod 19th ü´§üòï.. and I've managed to get a fever so I'm not doing so well...
77048- still no power. Just kind of losing my mind and hope. I love my home but I‚Äôve made up my mind on leaving.
For those that have questions about generators r/generator that should help you in detail.  The link has been added to the megathread.
77007 just off Studewood. The only house without power and it feels hopeless.
"Power was just restored at 77018 near Rosslyn and Bethlehem. CenterPoint trucks were canvassing the neighborhood for the past half hour. If you are still powerless, I am hoping you are next."
77008. 18th and Durham was up on Tuesday but went down again yesterday with no ETA.
77069 just got power!!!!! I‚Äôm so thankful my boss is understanding and not going to make me return to work till Wednesday so I can have time to get things back in order.
77006 Montrose nested outage back on!
77339 no power. Seeya tomorrow day 9!
"77346, still nothing. Hating Houston more everyday"
77037- still no powerüòû
"77023: Pearson and Broadmoor has power now. Didn‚Äôt see any linemen driving around yesterday so it was pretty surprising to get the notification that my power was restored. My house was confirmed to be a ‚Äúnested outage‚Äù. Before the restoration notification, I received one saying it wouldn‚Äôt be restored until the 19th."
77096 Meyer Forest Apartments. 4 out of 12 buildings have no power since the storm.
"77006, same situation with xfinity/comcast. Have power, haven't had internet in almost a week. Very grateful to have power, and very annoyed with xfinity for 0 communication. Anyone have their internet restored? Everyone I've talked to so far has it still out, but they're reporting 80% restored on their blog (havent had any direct communication about timelines either, just a generic ""you have no internet"" email.)

edit: my app now shows an ""estimation"" of internet restoration at 11:30 PM on Wednesday night. great."
77063 we were part of a nested outage and got power at around 9pm last night. If you‚Äôre in a nested outage make sure you check with Centerpoint that they have a ticket assigned at your address otherwise you may be missed
"77029, Moms house had power regained yesterday and she lost it again this morning at 8:30am and has been out since"
"77041, we called Centerpoint and they said somebody got assigned to our nested area. Hopefully today could be the day and not Friday."
nested outage in 77504 we were told they would come on thursday but 4 center point trucks are standing outside my very house!!! the nightmare is over!
"77076 Northline, still not light since I‚Äôm a nesting area :(
Edit: just called the emergency line to see if anything can be done or rushed as I have an elderly person living with me and all they told me was the systems were down‚Ä¶ like how tf are there systems down?!"
"Just want to say my power is still out, so I contacted all my elected representatives from city council on up to US congress. As of this morning Centerpoint had a rep call me personally to say the power should be restored today and that they would be providing me updates during the restoration process. If anyone is still having trouble getting at least a restoration date from Centerpoint, may be worth trying this approach. My power is still out but I at least have hope for its restoration for the first time in a week."
"77459 Creek Terrace/Cartwright.
My block and the block behind me have no power. The entirety of the rest of my neighborhood has power. As far as I can tell, 99% of Sugarland has their power back. 


77016. My mother's area, no power."
"77093 - Tidwell and 59, no power in area üòî new restoration date is the 18th now after being the 16th and then 14th"
[deleted]
"77055. Hammerly and Antoine. Both my parents and I live in the same neighborhood, literally one street from each other. Their neighborhood shows energized but they have no power and my home just shows as having an assessment done and ETA for power restoration is 7/19 but who the hell knows when I'll have power. I've been camping out at my parents but I hate it and wish I was back home."
Can someone suggest a coffee shop inside the loop that doesn't get super packed? I need to get some stuff done for work and our office still doesn't have power.
"77095 Nested outage

[No power because a fusable link was popped by a branch 4 days ago after we got power back for 20 hours](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/719564477070180476/1262208438386163804/image.png?ex=6695c2b6&is=66947136&hm=c668e88d72f42e52585c0463925db135c690f7242820951c9839813c35e9ce80&)

No centerpoint in the area because we're 'Energized' and they won't give me an estimated time when someone will come by to fix it.

It's a 5 minute fix that we're on day 4 waiting for."
"77082 - part of nested outage. Last update was from my apartment complex saying that CP has assigned a crew, but there is no estimate yet. I have not received email updates from CP despite signing up for their alert service"
77002 - I‚Äôm sorry for those who lost power and or haven‚Äôt had it restored yet. God bless.
055 here. Still hot and mad.
"77075 South Hobby- still part of this ongoing nested outage. My dad out in Lake Jackson texted me last night that they got power back. Day 8 of struggling to sleep and waking up still hot. Can't deal anymore

EDIT: WERE BACK ON. I saw a dangling line/line on the ground and reported the emergency yesterday afternoon. There was a whole crew here starting about 3 hours ago and now we have fans and lights again. I don't know if they came for the emergency call or if was just finally on the docket, but I want to give every one of those crew a beer and a steak, holy shit."
"77074.  Still no power here (we're ""energized"") but it's on across the street.  Street lights on our side are powered, too, but none of the residences.  No visible damage to the weatherhead on the house or lines leading to it.

eta: JOBU BE PRAISED!  Power on at 1646."
"77024 Still no power, I've heard people in the area getting power but ours is pushed til the 16th"
"77023, next to Mason Park. Tree from park is still downed over power lines. No linemen seen. They really do not give a fuck.

No power since 8am literally last Monday. No estimate from Centerpoint. Nothing."
"77092, Nina Lee and Antoine - no power"
The map updated and my area of 77066 is a pink blotch in a sea of green....

"77035, still no power in my area, out since 5am Monday"
77054 still outüò∞Part of a nested outage with no date for restoration. I live in a complex of 22 buildings and 6 are still no power!
77098 stuck in a nested outage. house got to 90 degrees so we finally evacuated the cats to somewhere else (family we're staying with has dogs and cat allergies)
"People really need to stop attacking the linemen trying to restore power. Today and yesterday people have tried to shoot, stab, run over, and block access to several crews."
"77070 my section of neighborhood got power around 7 pm yesterday‚Äîsuch a huge relief. Unfortunately there‚Äôs still a small section without power, and estimates are unclear right now."
77346- had it till storms on sat took it away. Now. Nothing.
77043 off of Gessner. No power still but workers were out yesterday. We are completely blank on the map.
77087 near gulfgate (45s and 610) still no power. Got an email from centerpoint saying this Friday
"77074 Next to Jane Long High. Originally, they said that they power would be back by Sunday night, but here we are still without power. As someone who immigrated here, this is some third-world shit."
"77379 - My parents have been without electricity since 6:30 AM last Monday and after getting power for a few minutes yesterday, something blew up a few blocks away and they were given an estimate of Friday, 7/19.  They are in the middle of what seems like a 3 mile by 3 mile dead zone."
Powered is finally restored 77086. Best wishes to everyone still without power
77008 - 18th and Ella - I‚Äôve now learned that I am in a ‚Äúnest outage‚Äù because buildings in the same complex as me have power which means CP‚Äôs estimate for power is Friday.
77396. Day 7 without power
"77055 - Have had power the whole time. Xfinity has been out since before the storm. Of course, just the normal bullshit from their reps online as to when it will come back. I wish we had reliable services here.

With power issues, internet, flooding, and heat it seriously makes me contemplate uprooting the family and moving somewhere else."
Im off weds and thurs. Any protest or any movement i can join?
"77339 - We're not getting power until Friday the 19th.

They said it's because of a line over the San Jacinto, but looking at the map shows all the lines over the SJ have been fixed OR do not even connect to us.

In fact, most of our grid, if it's accurate at all, are right next to grids that either have power now or are getting power today.

Make it make sense....TWO WEEKS from a tiny storm, absolutely insane."
"77021 (inner loop near macgregor/Griggs) ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..only house on the street with no power. All I NEED IS CP TO BRING MY METER! I paid for a brand new electric panel (per the cp worker that did the assessment last week. I even used his recommended guy) since my old panel was destroyed by the storm. It passed inspection by the COH this morning and has the green tag. 

I cannot get a person to relay this to nor can I leave a message. 

It‚Äôs kinda like how grocery stores have a 15 item or less lane for faster checkouts? CP needs something in place for quick jobs. 

Haha, this is too rich: The MF CENTERPOINT GAS truck just parked in front of my house on a mission to place the gas lines! That‚Äôs not the CP I want!

Anyone know any magic spells ? Voodoo? LoL to keep from crying."
77373 Cypresswood No Power
77339 no power. Says end of day Friday.
77004 only my neighnor in the downtown/midtown area has no electricity.
[deleted]
"77073 in the general vicinity of FM 1960 and Aldine Westfield. Power came on around 6PM Sunday though the map said it would be Wed the 17th. 

There are still some up and down Aldine Westfield and Cypresswood in this area of Spring without power. Not many comparatively but there are some."
77396 still no power but according to the Centerpoint map others in my ZIP code have their power restored. I think my cat's probably a more trustworthy source though so it hard to feel any hope about seeing progress on the map
77007 - lost water again. Called 311. Water line break near Lillian and Patterson reported at 9:54a. Expected completion 6-7 hrs.
"77025 - lots of outages between Stella Link and Academy. No signs of any action. Showing as grey in a sea of green on the outage map.

Edit: power back around 8pm!!!"
Spring Branch 77055 - Hammerly and Johanna just got power back
"77055, East Spring Branch, most houses just got power back on. A few streets, closer to Antoine, still no power."
77041 dying here at night
77066 - We're free. Power is on.
77098 our building and several houses on our street still without power. Been in Houston for 1 year and really want to quit my job pack my shit and go back to Dallas at this point
77022 - Independence Heights.   Have had power for a few days.
77018 and 77080 nested outages. Reported as coming back the 19th.
"77042 got power back on Saturday afternoon / East side of BW8 @ Briar Forest.

I say this for my neighbors & everyone still out of power: CenterPoint can eat a BERYL of DICKS!!!! This shit is unbelievable that there‚Äôs pockets without power."
77006 nested outage near Agora - power is back ON. I didn't see a single CP truck in the area until about 7p last night. Now they are all over the place.
"Anyone scheduled to get power today, how's that going? I was supposed to get it the 13th but that got pushed back to today. Members of my family go back to work and I'd like them to be able to sleep comfortably"
77021 map has said restored for the past 2 days but it‚Äôs incorrect
"77338 Riverwood/forest shadows area still no power
Apparently the map says we should be receiving power today yet I haven't seen one center point truck or anything here today.

Loosing hope"
"77380 power was just shut off again, no one at centerpoint was able to tell me anything when I called and they said their system was down so they couldn't look at my apt complex"
77396 - power back on!
"77018 power is back, it did flicker and I am worried about the incoming storms next week"
"here, nested area. i am starting to notice a pattern. The neighborhoods where people plant their trees right under the power-line and refuse to maintain it, thus, causing the branches to craw all over the power-lines are the main areas that are taking longer than usual. For the luv of god, if u have a tree, please maintain it or don't plant one at all."
77089 - Still no power on my side of the street while the other side is energized. Also got the message for it to be fixed by Friday but I sure hope its sooner.
77089 still no power and the map says energized. üò§
Has 77066 west richey and veterans been restored yet? I read that they were working on the pole in front of tim horton's.
"Saw it posted in the outage thread already, but 77018 just north of pinemont has power restored. We were told no earlier than the 18th fwiw"
Power back out in Missouri City 77489 last night around 5pm..after being on since Thursday.  Centerpoint said they're shutting down some folks to assist others in area...saying it was necessary to work on transformer
77043 power back on
77339 - no power. I guess they stopped updating the map once they hit 90%

Is centerpoint‚Äôs 713 207 2222 number not working for anyone else?
77024 Power just went out around 3:30 PM. Hasn‚Äôt come back on yet.
Did anyone in 77018 just lose power again? Had it restored Saturday now it‚Äôs gone :-/
77386 - still no power and have not received an update from centerpoint since last week. Must be a transformer issue.
77021 - 2 days of power and now it‚Äôs off. Someone needs to be held accountable for this nonsense.
