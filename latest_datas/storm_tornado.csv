Core of rotation just passed directly over Towne Lake."
"One of the most insane rain and wind events I've ever been through in this city, outside of a hurricane."
"Power out in the heights, very very high speed winds"
Powers out at my local bar. Patio tent is ripped to shreds. The drunks are in shambles
"My wife just called, she is at happy hour downtown and says a tornado just blew out the windows of the bar."

Please do not discharge your firearms at this storm.  It cannot be killed.

Edit: [Loop of storm moving over Houston area](https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/s/vEePtX7vVM)"
"It was hell for 5-10 minutes, and now it's calmed down for a bit.

Got no power. 😭"
Please keep the updates coming. Thank you for this information
"North Houston (very close to Spring) was WILD… fun fact, the carriage carts at my local Kroger are NOT cemented in. I never felt so Final Destination in my life."
"Over in Memorial area now and I can hear the winds screech and howl. 

I stayed at work late like an idiot."
"Pay heed. I’m to the NW near renny fest area. We had what I believe to be a tornado or damn near touch down out here on the farm. Took a big pine out that just missed our main house. Took out a chunk of fence. Security camera on the fence post went for a heck of a ride. 

Serious weather! Be careful.

Editing to add: Neighbor’s house was leveled. Talk about conflicting emotions. Relief and grief. Horrible."
"The storm could have at least taken me out to dinner before the whole Wham Bam Thank You Ma'am treatment. Damn, that was a swift moving storm."
just got a destructive thunderstorm warning rn too
"Thank OP, this was a lovely post to do for our community. Appreciate this post so very much."
Power is out. It sounds close to me and it’s pitch black outside 🥴 the air pressure keeps making my ears pop
Currently at memorial city mall. Lights flickered but think the worst is passing by just now
"So, if you’re in an apartment at the top floor do you head down to the bottom floor of like the garage or just move to a windowless room in your apartment (like, 4 floors high, not like a sky scrapper)."
"I'm in montrose, I think the rain and wind calmed down a little. I still have power currently."
"Currently stuck in the LA fitness off of Yale, emergency lights only but people are just working out as normal (minus the machines which require power of course)

Picked a bad day to walk to the gym"
Windows blown out of skyscrapers and Minute Maid leaking.
Anyone completely forget Tornado safety and ignorantly watch the storm near their windows 😅
"Upper floor of a high-rise here, *that was a new experience.*

The sky went mint green (not the pale lime I’ve seen in tornadic storms before), then forest green, then black. 

Cargo-blankets of rain, lots of within-5 mile lightening but very little heard thunder until the end."
That was crazy. In Cypress near 290 and Cypress Rosehill. Has there been a confirmed tornado?
The siding of my house got ripped off 😔 Got a giant hole & water leaking from the rain.
This has been a super helpful post!
"Thank you for this, it was super helpful and so much appreciated!"

Tornado Chasers in Houston live feed."
Spring Branch is in rough shape.
First time without power since the freeze
"Centerpoint reporting nearly 900,000 people without power right now"
"Spring Branch looks like a hurricane went through it. Trees down everywhere. On houses. In the roads.

School ain't opening tomorrow."
"In a downtown hirise, been creaking, can see water in the commode moving just a bit..."
New to Houston - when exactly do I need to shelter? Like within the house I mean?
It was hell scary!!! Sitting on the interstate with our truck rocking & debris hitting the vehicle.
"Major transmission lines down everywhere, it will take time. Considerably more than 800k are prepared for I’m afraid."
I thought this was going to be another incorrect weather prediction and laughed it off but boy was I wrong
"Was on I10 a little after 6 and could see just a black wall to the north and west. Around 630 I was on 610 and in a matter of minutes everything went black. It was wild. 

10/10 storm"
My aunt lives right near Hammerly and the Beltway a tree fell on her house she is going to have a get another roof.   She got a new roof 3 1/2 years earlier.  She is ok.
Scary… Thought my windows were gonna blow out. No power either. Stay safe everyone! I hear ambulances
"Jeez, we might see the sun again today....wtf"
"My girlfriend is back home in Jersey village (I’m out of town on a business trip in Mississippi) and a tree was totally uprooted and a palm tree was snapped and tossed into our apartment complex’s pool.

Idk if it was a tornado but it must’ve been one hell of a storm to uproot those trees like that."
"Well that was fucking crazy. Pitch black outside looked like it was midnight, power went out 3 times thankfully its on now. Pretty sure the building or something very close got hit by lightning, I could hear the power surge. Ca-razy"
Powers out at my local bar. Patio tent is ripped to shreds. The drunks are in shambles
"I watched the velocity radar data while the storm moved through. Looked like the center of it went southeast along 290 on the northwest side of town, then turned more ESE just after it got inside the North Loop 610, then more eastward along I-10 outbound on the east side of town.

That big ol' velocity couplet in OP's lower pic persisted all the way through town. Those dark blues represent wind speeds of up to 100 mph, IIRC. If there *was* a tornado, there'll probably be a damage path through those areas."
Just drove from jersey village to spring. I do not recommend. That was absolutely wild
Thanks for all the updates. I’m in Washington Ave area and lost power about an hour ago. Stay safe out there everyone!

"Thank goodness for my neighbor. He knows I have back issues and came over to get some limbs cut back from the roof. Great guy.

Thanks J

The storm was wicked fast. It started at my house with lots of lightning before it began to rain. I got the emergency closet ready lol"

just lost power in montrose off westheimer!
What's the best site to see updates?
Time for Ted Cruz to go on vacation
"I’m an idiot I know, but this thread really saved our lives tonight. I actually listened to people to go into my bathroom and learned what the fuck to actually do in a tornado watch. Tornado legit like down the road from us."
I was outside when this came
Wife just told me some trees got fucked up and part of my fence is down.
My power just came back on. 45 and Telephone area.
How is OP so cool
Hope everyone is okay after that tropical storm hurricane tornado thunder storm.
No power in clear lake
"With this many people without power, are we talking days to get it back?"
"wild, quite the gully washer"
No power in the energy corridor for the last hour or so. That was rather “spicy” for sure!
"I drove from my job (west of IAH) to Kingwood, and ohhhhh myyyyyy gooodnessss. That was fucking wild, my car was shaking in the wind. Wtf"
Anyone see Minute Maid park get a ton of water blowing in it
Bro I was in the fkn tornado on the way home from work on the inner loop and 610
"The wind kept changing directions! At one point, I could hear the branches of trees on my front yards scraping across the roof. And those branches are pretty high *above* the roof on a normal day. Wind wa just pushing the trees sideways. 

We have no power since 6:30 pm. 

Injury report: I broke a toe. And I wanna know who moved that damned footrest!"
"I was driving from Cypress to Museum district with that massive black cloud in my rear view mirror the whole time, then RIGHT when I exited it finally caught up to me😭 in the blink of an eye, it went from no rain to sideways rain.. it looked like I was in a hurricane / tornado, trees falling next to me and debris hitting my car... I pulled over to park in some neighborhood and some really nice strangers let me into their house to wait it out😭 scariest storm experience ever omg"
"My mom lives in Katy and works at a drug store. She sent me pics of the sign of their building where one of the letters ripped off from the wind and the signage by the street came off. The gas station across the street had their roof cave in. This is wild. 

I'm in Montrose and my dog never gets scared during storms but woudnt stop shaking. I had to swaddle him to get him to calm down."
That was wild omg. Had just got home from work and then boom 5 minutes later power went out and I started hearing violent winds.
I was on 610 west and it was insane.
"At least 4 fatalities from the storm, per the mayor’s office."
Jebus F Christ. I left the Wortham theater at 6:30 PM and headed down Memorial only to see broken tree limbs fly by my truck. Lightening everywhere and Memorial was a river. I ended up under the new tunnels until it blew over. That shit was fucking crazy. I got out of downtown just as the glass from the buildings began to fall.
"Centerpoint reporting > 850k without power.

Gear up for a long one"
"We just drove through it off 290 and Fry. The lightning was bad, the sky turned a greenish, then the rain hit. There was hail and the wind was insane. We were all trying to park under the overpass for cover."
"I was in willow brook mall, they are closing the mall. Lights were flicking, it was pitch dark. The bright side is that the worse part passed and we were able to walk out and head home. Be careful if yall are out."
Definitely just got FCKD UP in Katy near Cypress... I think we got lucky
"Tore up Bellville again, we just got back on our feet from the last one. Time to get the chainsaw out again."
"Multiple power lines down, mild flooding 107 mph wind gusts"
Dayum!  It was bad in midtown saw 1 leaning electrical poll by work
Anyone else's power out
Power out for the last hour or so at the Galleria area. Centerpoint outage tracker isn't tracking. Jackery power station is working overtime.
https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2024/05/16/video-appears-to-show-funnel-cloud-in-cypress-area/
"Spring branch area, tree fell in the driveway, and can't get out. Missed my landlord's house by *that* much.  Power out, besides LL's backup generator."
That appeared out of no where! Looks like the worst passed here in the heights
That shit was kinda scary not gonna lie
"My knees were literally shaking, yall. I thought for sure one of the single-pane windows of my old ass house was gonna get busted as I could hear them rattling (they are all intact). I then heard a crash and it was the giant tree next door falling onto my house.  🙃

Scary shit. This will be fun to deal with in the morning.

Power is still out over here in Fifth Ward"
What app is that?

"Jersey Village here, no power, busted window and water went over my rain boots😖"
"I’m in Cypress, my roof is trashed!"
"Tornado in Katy
Passed thru my neighborhood"
[deleted]
We just got our power back on I live in Friendswood
"Not my first storm but my first time dealing with it alone. I've been blessed in the past to have been home or not in Houston for major weather incidents. I made the noob mistake of taking my usual route home, which flooded. I was also genuinely convinced my car was going to fly away. I finally relaxed when I got home. I was so relaxed that I managed to throw up lol. I work at a preschool so I didn't check my phone until it was too late."
I’m near Upper Montrose and I’m not sure what’s going on cuz I sheltered in the middle of the house but it sounds awful outside. Like the wind is hitting the entire building from all directions. Anyone felt or saw similar in the area?
We were at 610 North and 69 at about 6:35 pm. Hit by either really high winds or potentially a tornado. There was a lot of debris (tin/sheets of metal from a roof?) being blown across the highway and hitting cars. Hit by hail (dime to maybe ping pong ball sized). It was extremely bad for about 15 minutes. Sheltered with a bunch of cars and a metro bus beneath an underpass
Clear Lake here; winds picking up and starting to rain hard. We still have power
"to everyone who said they were on the roads when this hit, glad y’all are ok 🙏 100+mph winds was insane to witness inside but to be in the car… jeezus"
power restored in heights
"Houston, we have a problem."
I got caught in it on 11th and Yale. I’ve never been so scared in my life
For you folks who have never been through a hurricane: Imagine the worst of tonight's storm. Then imagine that for about 12 hours straight.
Just ate curry in the dark for dinner
Almost knocked my fence down off j.c. Blvd and petty street roughly 6:30. Power out and rain still going sideways. Stay safe everyone.
"I live in a townhouse apartment on 3rd floor, where's the best place for me to go? There's not really space on the ground level, I'd be standing in front of the front door essentially."
I was at the beach
This is going to take a while to clean up
Yeah where I stay it was crazyyyyy
It was pretty gnarly. I live in the heights and we’re all out of power
Seems like a tornado touched down. Near Love Park on 11th.
"I heard it was really bad.
I pray the people are safe."
"I don’t live there so I just heard about this, and I’m so so sorry to everyone who was affected by this. I have family in Montgomery; I’m guessing this stayed to the south of there, correct? I don’t wanna wake them up so I’ll reach out to them in the morning. I appreciate any info!  
Sincerely, an Okie"
Waking up at 3:45am because of a transformer blowing up twice. I still don’t have power. How are these transformers still exploding without power? It’s extremely loud and fills the sky with a greenish yellow color.
Power out along Stanford in Montrose.  Thank goodness I have a generator! Phew!
"Drove thru it, 10/10 for the Twister Experience."
"I’m genuinely fucking tired of severe/freak weather events happening while I’m home alone with an infant and a 5yo

I was home alone, pregnant, watching my friends 2 month, with my 4yo, when a tornado ripped down our street last year. He was at work then, and didn’t believe me when I initially told him “fucking tornado!”

And now there’s been several since my husband started working out of town. 

I’m just over it"

I experienced 80 MPH winds from the 25th floor where my outer walls are either half or whole floor to ceiling glass; windows that open out were rattling loud. Figure this glass is pretty strong after surviving this. My huge German Shepherd was like🤔 I don’t like this one bit…Pretty scary😱
"Timbergrove Manor reporting in, albeit late. Lived in Houston since 2002, worst wind weather I’ve seen. Lots of mature trees in the neighborhood are down, some of them on homes. Various points on E TC Jester near Timbergrove are blocked by downed trees. No power, of course."

At 249 and 99. Swear there had to be a tornado close. Shit was wild for a bit. Anyone know if there was one? Power out.
"I didn't get a tornado alert on my personal phone and IDK why but the alert was in Spanish on my work phone. I remember thinking ""huh, wonder what that's for."" 🤦‍♀️ I thought it was just a lot of rain until I saw the news."
Any concerns more north? Montgomery county area? Or does the weather seem focused in the Houston area?

I wasn’t prepared for that to happen; I did not even know it would be raining today, but you’re doing gods work by making people aware of this."
"I never lost power and my house and property is intact. I hope y’all are safe.

"I live in Cypress and the tornado hit Bridgeland, twelve minutes away from where I live. My entire neighborhood has stop signs that have been ripped out of the ground, trees and utility poles knocked over, etc. When the storm came thru, it was incredibly scary watching the sky turn black SO FAST"
"I hope all are well. We were lucky in League City and caught a glancing blow. My area looks pretty good but there are many more places that families are left devastated. My son and daughter on the northeast side are undamaged but without power for the time being. I’m currently looking at routes to get to The Heights to get a generator to my elderly in-laws. 

I’m hoping we can pull together, like Houston always does, and get each other through this event. Stay safe everyone."
This Grid in Texas needs to be fixed!
Just seeing this now 😭

Wish I got a notification about this four days ago:/
"fuck it uber eats time, make the big bucks tonight!"
"Brit here travelling around Texas. Houston is our last stop.
Was staying in a sky-rise Airbnb in the Rice Neighbourhood.
That shit was crazy. Sirens were going off on my phone (we don’t get that in the UK!), power went out and then the downtown buildings disappeared in the black sky.

In our shared experience, can I be anointed as an honorary Houston-citizen? 

Hope those still without power get theirs restored soon."
Any major damage in Tomball?
(:
Hope everyone is okay after that tropical storm hurricane tornado thunder storm.
"Uh oh, time for Texas to switch into socialism mode again LOL!

"My heart goes out to those in the path of the storm . 



    Now that being said welcome back to the USA. You can bark and pull at your chain but every time something goes wrong ""oh no big poppa government save us "" . We are here to help stop telling us you can do this on your own because all that that's doing is fucking up the system you morons. Stop letting them steal all your hard earned money and then give you mediocre service."
That was an engineered storm... Like they opened a refrigerator and flipped a wind switch... Be honest you've never seen a storm like that... I literally saw whirlwind tornados going back and forth that was different
Don’t worry your governor has it taken care of. Sorry for the people without power but F off Texas. Abbot has you covered. 🤣
