77388 - Woke up to having power. I am celebrating.
"While I get this whole situation sucks, if you have a status report,  please start the post with your zip code and then whatever frustration you feel.


Not only will this help keep the thread organized, but it will also allow a neighbor to empathize with your situation.

Additionally,  please reread the post throughout the day as updates on resources are made as they come in."
Finally found a hotel. Confirmed they were open and had power so I booked a room. Get there and they‚Äôre closed with a sign on the door. The employees standing right behind the door wouldn‚Äôt even answer the phone. I think this was my final breaking point & now I‚Äôm just crying in my car because I can‚Äôt take one more night of the heat
"Dawn of the Third Day. I never thought I'd miss electricity so much. I can deal with the no lights, showering in the dark, and no electronics. Working overnights, my main reprieve from the heat is during the coolest parts of the day while sleep, which never comes easy even on powered days, is in the hottest time. I dream I'll be jostled awake with the sound of the A/C rumbling to life but instead waking up with my undershirt soaked from sweat. The things I would do for just a fan to help. 

Food is now spoiled even though the fridge has only been opened an infinitesimal amount of time. Doing anything at home is exhausting with the humidity so I pretend to drive around in my air conditioned car in search of non-existent ice and watch people incapable of navigating a temporary four way stop. See people sitting in line for gas or for food probably also enjoying the bit of cool air left in their world as we all wish for sweet release from this nightmare on the sun.

Anyway, we delivered the bomb."
Dan Patrick can you please stfu and get to information about power? He‚Äôs going on and on about Biden. What the fuck is wrong with this idiot.
Map is updated with a new message of ‚ÄúWe will continue to provide estimated restoration times as they become available‚Äù. Lmao. Can‚Äôt make this stuff up
Tomorrow‚Äôs title should be ‚ÄúBeryly Hanging On‚Äù
77004 still no power.am slow cooked pork at this point
The real tracker was all the friends we made along the way/s
"Great - its storming, a new excuse for Centerpoint"
In before CenterPoint blames the rain this afternoon for why they didn‚Äôt deliver estimates on restoration this morning as promised.
"Fantastic, this rain just set things back another 24hrs."
Am I tripping or have they restored less than a 100k people so far today. This is going miserably slow
"77063 - off fondren and westheimer, no power. My complex just sent an email out saying there‚Äôs an electricity pole down behind the building and Centerpoint can‚Äôt provide an estimated time of when things will be up. Think I‚Äôm gonna rent a car and head to Louisiana. 

As someone who experienced Katrina, running to LA from TX is an irony I never saw coming."

"> To help customers who remain without power plan around their outages, CenterPoint Energy will begin providing estimated restoration times on its restoration status tracker before noon today.

Well its 12 noon, and ü¶óü¶óü¶ó"
So how many ppl came back to join the lights out party after this little thunderstorm??? **And boots and cats and boots and cats**
I managed to fall asleep for an hour or so and dreamt I had ac. What a shit reality to wake back up to
77057- no power still. Neighbor‚Äôs friend said she called centerpoint and they said probably today. PLEASEüò≠
77459 - still no power.
 If I end up failing the bar exam later this month (God forbid) I will unironically be blaming Centerpoint
Warming up a can of spaghettios. Hope this shit tastes as good as it did when I was kid.
This is fucking ridiculous
"Hey Centerpoint, I wrote you but you still ain‚Äôt callin‚Äô"
"got an email from centerpoint - ‚ÄúOutage repairs have been completed. Our crews determined that the problem was caused by pole damage. If you are still without service, please check your circuit breakers‚Äù

The power is still out, and the pole is still hanging by the wires. Such a bs!!!¬†"

"My transfer to the Midwest got approved. I'm fucking done. This isn't going to get better, only worse. The food ain't worth misery."
"77012 - near Ingrando Park, no power, no hope, feel like a brisket"
77338 no power no information on when it‚Äôs coming back.  Sleeping in my car tonight it‚Äôs unbearable in my apartment now.
"77082. Every neighborhood around us has power, can see it from my front porch, except us"
"77091: no power yet. We're good on gas in the cars. Have spotty cell service. Finding ice every day has been a challenge. I'm pretty patient and this is not my first rodeo. For Ike we were out of power for a really long time. I'm starting to get annoyed though. The heat is effecting my mood. 

I need a camp stove. Anyone seen one around? Maybe I should Amazon it. I can hit up REI or Academy or bass pro if anyone has seen a camp stove there

Spent a good deal of time yesterday at the YMCA pool to cool off. Good place to take a hot shower too."
"77009 - had no power for 6 days during the derecho. Now on day 4 without power. I just can‚Äôt believe this is what the state of Houston is. I prepared for the power to go out but like a fool, I expected more of them after May‚Äôs fiasco."
[deleted]
WTF is this rain ‚òπÔ∏è
The rain is definitely gonna delay the restoration but it is definitely a great relief from the hot weather
At least it‚Äôs cooler than it was. So that‚Äôs fun
77004 - Just got power around 1pm ü•π
Probably safe to assume that centerpoint still not having estimates for the vast majority of the city is a bad sign yeah? Am I to understand that they have not even scheduled work to begin in those areas?
"This might be a long shot. Does anyone have a lead to a 2 or 3 bedroom Airbnb in the Houston metro with power and capabilities to take 4 adults and a 7 day old baby starting tomorrow? No one is answering on the other listings. Happy to pay market rate and everything. We‚Äôre just currently getting kicked out of our current one tomorrow due to another renter. Because our power came back on so we prepared to go back to Heights, but now it‚Äôs off again. And we‚Äôre SOL for tomorrow and beyond."
"Is this getting national coverage?  After Harvey, there were armies of rescue vehicles and help here within days from across the country.  Was great to see people working together.  People are just suffering here and nobody locally or nationally is taking charge. Maybe I'm missing some coverage, going on 84 hours without power."
Another night of drinking on the porch staring at the apartment complex 100 feet from me that has power üò≠
"Wow. So most of Houston is blue or green now. Interesting. How did they asses anyone so fast??

EDIT: I spoke with someone at CenterPoint and was told that a crew hadn‚Äôt been assigned to my area yet and there was no ETA. She also mentioned that the map had been updated and will continue to be updated. So I checked the map and I‚Äôm in a blue area now (yesterday I was orange) but ‚Ä¶how if there hasn‚Äôt been a crew assigned yet. I‚Äôm confusion and this heat isn‚Äôt helping lol"
I just opened the windows after the storm passed and man that feels so fucking good
"My elderly parents finally got power about 25 mins ago in 77070, neighborhood between grant and millsüôå. thank you linemen, fuck centerpoint.


I also live in 77070, north side of 249, no power yetü´†"
Ain‚Äôt this a bitch!? Literally every apartment complex but mine has power on my street.
I‚Äôm beginning to think this is a Centerpoint problem and not a Beryl problem.
We should start counting the fatalities from delay in medical care. I just finished a shift and my hospital is absolutely broken. People always say that healthcare is collapsing. It‚Äôs already collapsed. People with admit orders sitting in the ED waiting room for >8 hours (after admission!). The majority of them due to having no electricity.
Centerpoint reporting 500k customers could be without power until next week: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07ufDWQJvfs
"Is it just me or is Centerpointless restoring power to retail stores seem a bit more of a priority over restoring power to residents first? We live in Meyerland and all of the stores around our neighborhood have power but many if not most of my neighborhood has no power.
I understand that restoring power to hospitals, stations for emergencies, city government offices etc is acceptable but is restoring power with more emphasis on retail before residents acceptable if it is happening? So the question is, Would your rather get power first before your grocery store and favorite retail store/restaurant or would you want power on at retail stores so you can get the hell out of the house and sit somewhere else for a while? Let me know your thoughts.
EDIT: From my perspective, restoring power to emergency operations is key but residents should be next. I really don‚Äôt like going through all this with a wife who had 3 panic attacks after the storm and a 7 year old who had no clue why we have no ‚ÄúFood Power‚Äù, (she thinks electricity makes our food. She is so cute)."
"Anyone else see the horrible attempt at pity baiting that centerpoint is doing on twitter,  we know that wind knocks down trees but it should've been cleared off days ago. Wtf?"
The outage map doesn't even show an estimated time for our area. I want to scream but I don't have the energy for it.
just got power back at 77459 near Lexington/dulles!
77498 had power since yesterday and now it‚Äôs out again.  Damn.  Just bought groceries and now depending on how long it takes might just be a loss again.  This sucks.
The #s on the tracker are going down alarmingly fast (or just faster than I‚Äôm used to) and instead of making me feel better it‚Äôs making me more anxious that we still don‚Äôt have power üòµ‚Äçüí´
"Seeing a recent trend on social media of people starting to stand up for Centerpoint? One boomer on Next door said he feels sorry for them because it was a ""freak event"" and that's the price of having trees. First of all, we're on the gulf coast. This shit is fairly predictable. Second of all, Florida has trees too, asshole. They had power up 4 days after a Cat 4 hit them a few years ago.

Then, I see posts on IG where people are saying we should be supporting the linemen. No shit. I don't think anyone is mad at the actual guys working the problem. It's *Centerpoint* that is a bag of flopdicks. We can be mad at CP and still treat the linemen well. I don't know how people are getting confused here.

Fucking morons."
"It‚Äôs STORMING now??? This might be the end of me, I swear it. If my power even flickers I‚Äôm going to freak out. I just got power back last night"
This flair will be permanent. Fucking ass company
genuinely what am i supposed to do with all the anger i have?

"77095 no power. Crazy past 12 hours. Dropped kids off at my sisters. Avoided house like the plague, got home around midnight, wife and I grabbed dogs stayed in car till 1:30 am listening to our 57 hr book. Went to convenience store bought cold water, came home took freezing cold shower, went to bed at 2 with cold water by our sides and one in front of a portable fan. Still woke at 6 AM sweating, grabbed dogs, slept in car till 9. This is hell."
"77043, everyone but my apartment complex has power. Can't wait to move back to California."
Has anyone heard anything about the midday ETA tracker? Or did they forget people are desperately waiting on that to make accommodations as necessary...
77007 got power back at our apartment complex near Cleveland Park
77018 no power - 43rd and rosslyn
"77092 - if you have been running a generator since the storm, it‚Äôs probably time to change your oil (every 50-100 hours). The hotter the temperature, the faster it runs through oil. Also, check your oil level every day. My generator kept shutting down and after a bunch of troubleshooting I realized there was very little oil."
"Just yelling into the dark here, but I think hurricane categories and tropical storm ranking/types should be reconsidered.

After Katrina, Ike, Harvey, Memorial Day, This years tornando, and this past week, the only type of storm that has ever felt to be understood properly was Harvey.

The way the world hasn‚Äôt learned to combat storms after we all stopped to see Katrina in the media is baffling. I will never forget being a teenager and just seeing people CONSISTENTLY be filmed to be picked up by helicopter 24/7"
"77077 energy corridor. Just came back on üò≠

Edit: lmao thunderstorms rolled in and it promptly went out again. Lasted about 30 minutes."
"77066 (Klein) 2:40pm


Still no power for blocks, traffic lights still dark


Cell service has returned to full 5G strength (at least for T-Mobile)


Crews managed to move the fallen utility poles out of the roadways, but still have yet to see any linemen doing any replacements / repairs


If you look on CP tracker, it shows we are green, but it's a lie. Power out on Bammel N Houston from Veterans to BW8 and everything within at least a two mile radius."
"77573 League City. Just got powered back, hopefully it stays on. Thank you for everyone in this thread for keeping me sane.  Hopefully the rest of you get your power soon!"
"77009 - Norhill. Still no power. All my friends have power back, and I'm feeling a little sad about not. Some friends got power back at 930 last night so I'm trying to stay hopeful. But the light at Studewood and 14th which was on yesterday is now off, and I am taking that as an ominous sign.¬†"
77339 absolutely nothing no progress no trucks and staring down the barrel of day 5. I went to the bathroom and didn't try to flip on the light reflexively so I guess you could say I'm broken.
"77090- Cypress Station. No power, nor have I seen any workers. Several trees down on other apartments, saw one tree on lines near Red Fern and Wild Oak.¬†"
77007 Jackson at Wash by Memorial. Nothing.¬†
Odds that Centerpoint actually gives estimates before noon?
"I know this is a smaller issue with the power being out but for those that are having Xfinity problems on their [outage credit page](https://www.xfinity.com/support/account-management/credits/outage/details), don‚Äôt forget to claim your outage credit! I tried and was able to claim $5. $5 is better than nothing."
"I'm at my boyfriends place in 77031. He's had power since the night of the storm.¬†


It just started storming here and power went out"
77459 - Sienna - Lots of people getting messages that power will be on by end of day tomorrow.
"77018- garden oaks near 34th/brinkman- still no power. We finally packed up and went to stay with a friend two miles away who does have power and wtf I forgot how good AC feels. 

My street is in the ‚Äúcircuit assigned‚Äù status of the map they released yesterday but no dice. I got a text from CenterPoint at midnight saying they hope to provide specific restoration times by eod 7/11."
77077 still dark at briar forest and kirkwood. Abc13 reporting that only 400k homes will be restored by EOD FRIDAY. Friday?? What about today? And that still leaves 750k without power until next week.
"77024 Still no power. Still no progress on the massive tree down and the power line it snapped like twig on Memorial. Out and about yesterday to cool and refuel, and there are still trees down and obstacles in the roads around here that look like they haven't even been taped off or addressed at all. Cleanup has started, but repairs seem a ways off. 

Wife's office downtown never lost power (shocker) and when she went in yesterday, it took Centerpoint all of about two and a half hours to get her connected parking garage's entry arms, elevators, and lights operational with a few calls placed. Memorial City Mall up and running (to it's defense it's likely grid to the Hospital.) Even listening to the Astros in the dark is weird knowing there is a sports stadium downtown all lit up. Priorities I suppose. 

I called my folks last night to see if we could come stay with them in Bellville until we get power back. That caused a riff because my dad was like Come on with it and my mom said yes, but  we wouldn't be able to bring our two dogs. So now I'm going to spend the morning looking for a legit boarding / pet spa place that may be open so we can head out to my folks. If not, we ride it out here. 

Apologies for the rant, I've slept like 5 hours in the past three days."
"77379... no power, no internet, no data, text only. This sucks! I never thought I would miss the local news.. those local news apps on my phone wont work unless I drive 30 miles to find a cell tower that gets my phone working. I am managing thou, drove into work (Med Center) and have internet! Such a huge help, I can now figure out what stores are open and where to go to get gas. And I can make calls!! 

My home/cars survived-but barely-so lucky I parked where I don't normally do. I remember Ike was not this bad and it took 14 days then to get power..  I had my wife go pick up my brother in-law and head to her mom's. I am home taking care of the cats, and feeding the generator. Its a small generator that just powers the fridge/freezer and one fan. I know thats better than most have it.. am blessed."
77479 - next to University BLVD in Sugar Land. No Power.
"If this update is to be believed, the % of areas with actual estimates (and thus actual work orders) is absurdly low. Maybe 1 of every 25 I click in the inner loop has an estimate. We are fucked."

77066- still no power.
"77098 - off buffalo speedway and richmond. Still no power, but only in this complex and the one next door. Everyone else seems to have power"
"77088 some neighborhoods have power, some don‚Äôt. Happened last time after the derecho. I‚Äôm anticipating another few days without power"
"77096, near Chimney Rock and West Bellfort, no power.   There is power running along Chimney Rock, but as soon as you enter the neighborhood the power disappears."
"77007 near Durham and Washington. Still no power. Houses a block over have power, which makes it feel somehow worse. Most of my neighbors seem to have fled to hotels or out of town. 

Starting to feel pretty hopeless."
"77077 Briar Forest & Dairy Ashford area. No power. Drove around a lot in the early morning/night. I‚Äôm not seeing much damage. After a long cruise I only spotted a few trees in lines, and two actual power lines down. 

I know there‚Äôs more than what I can find, but damn does it feel like there‚Äôs ‚Äúmore‚Äù bullshit this time around with Center Point."
"77388, no power.  Been ‚Äòblue‚Äô since Tuesday.  No end expected.  Have been running a 6,250 watt gas generator since Monday evening to power fridges and deep freeze and we are blessed to have two portable a/c‚Äôs to help us sleep at night."
"Really sorry for all those without power. I hope shit gets fixed soon.

Does anyone have information on xfinity outages in Montrose and surrounding areas?"
"77070, right at the intersection of Louetta & 249. Received notice that they‚Äôre expecting power back EOD Friday."
"77586 - Seabrook 

My apartment building has had power since Monday afternoon but I just learned this morning there‚Äôs several buildings here still in the dark.

I work across the street from JSC and on my way in I saw Centerpoint staging trucks and setting up tents at Clear Lake Park.

Hopeful that more of this area will come back online today."
77077 I just passed a load of trucks fixing the downed lines near highway 6. I hope this means we‚Äôre back by tonight!
"77074, was stuck on the corner of Fondren and Beechnut after the storm and saw repair crews putting up a new post. Not sure if that‚Äôll solve our problems and get the lights back on, but that‚Äôs the first crew I‚Äôve seen all week."
"Neighbor just texted that the powers back on in 77449, west little York and fry"
77004. My biggest concern now is the afternoon thunderstorms. This can‚Äôt be helped because weather. But it will continue to slow things down. And I hate the daily texts from Centerpoint that everything‚Äôs fixed when I can walk out my front door and see that it‚Äôs not. The teasing only makes it worse.
"With each passing day with no power, I become more radicalized. Death to CenterPoint"
lol and now thunderstorms
77042 and I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve come home from work day 4 and still no power. I‚Äôm so tired of this. I just want a good nights sleep.
I haven't had a hot meal in 4/5 days that I thought McDonald's was good even though I haven't eaten from them in like 4-5 years

Wtf does ‚ÄúAssessment Complete‚Äù mean
So noon was bullshit. Of course it was. 88.7 is talking to the CPVP right now.
"77024 @ Memorial & Chimney Rock - still no power since early AM Monday, but Centerpoint upgraded our restoration status in their outage map from Orange (Assessment in Progress) to Blue (Assessment Complete), so progress(?). Only thing is they also upgraded almost everyone else in the city so I must question the reliability of the map."
7/11 is doing free slurpees today. At least on Longpoint and Blalock in Spring Branch
77063 still no power here & haven‚Äôt seen any trucks

77088 West Montgomery near Paradise cemetery.  Light returned at 7 pm after being out since Monday morning. Happy to be cooling down but scared of it happening again.
"77006 still no power. On commonwealth and Waugh right behind The Flat, I fear workers see the lights from the bar, if they have driven by, and think we have power too. Seems all streets around us have regained power except D‚ÄôOrleans(complex name). Service requests have been made but I still haven‚Äôt seen a single service truck in our area and we‚Äôre approaching day 5. Losing morale."

"77003- downed lines, downed pole, still nothing. I‚Äôm starting to get pissed."
77007. Still no power but water came back which was out before. On our way down Jackson hill this morning we saw a line crew working on the intersection of Jackson hill and Feagan so hopefully good news soon!
"77086 no power since Monday 7am - neighborhood got power Tuesday around 9pm, transformer blew (heard large boom) and power went out for my house and a couple of other houses on the block. Scared we‚Äôll be last to get power back sometime next week since we‚Äôre so few houses. Very similar thing happened during Ike and we lost power for 18 days while streets surrounding us had power about a week in. Attempting to take my elderly mother to an airbnb.¬†

Kinda hoped things would be different or at least faster than what it was nearly 20 years ago‚Ä¶"
"lol somehow the number on Centerpoint's website has gone up by 8,136 customers since I started checking it at 6:30 this morning.

It was like this yesterday in the AM too though, then in the afternoon the number started dropping substantially. Hopefully all this means is they are needing to shut off power to complete some repairs for an even bigger number of people. Hope everyone's power comes back soon."
"Excellent news! My neighborhood in Meyerland has been assessed. Idk wtf that means but I hope they finish soon. I‚Äôd like to sleep in my bed sometime in the near future. 

What pisses me off the most is that there is a vacant church building 100 ft from my house that has power. wtf?"
They meant noon Pacific Team obviously
I‚Äôve calculated that 87% of customers in Houston were without power at one point? So that means like 6 million people? 2.7 people per ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù? just trying to get a sense of the scale

"77043 - Near Spring Woods HS - No power since 6am Monday

Purely anecdotal, but today's map is significantly more accurate than yesterday's re: correctly identifying the power status of friends' houses around the area.

The issue is with the blue ""Assessment Complete"" classification...I know for a fact that there are a number of snapped poles and large trees down on lines all along the east side of Nob Hill Park, and that whole area is in the blue. So I mean...I'm glad they've supposedly ""assessed"" it, but there's no way to know whether that's a ""we're fixing everything today"" or ""it's going to take 3 weeks to replace the poles and get the lines back up""."
"77007 Asbury and Memorial. Ironically, we had power through the hurricane and up until yesterday at 11 am.  Then it suddenly went out and remains out.  No idea what's going on."

It feels like it may be well into next week before my home gets power back. My cat is physically doing okay with the heat, but I can tell she's unhappy and she's taking it out on me by biting my feet while I (try to) sleep because I'm not under the covers. What's a good way to keep a cat cool without air conditioning? I tried wrapping her in a wet towel last night but she wasn't having it."
"Clicked around to all my cousin‚Äôs places to see if there would be information on ETA, none of the 5+ houses I clicked on have ETAs, nice."
77008 still don‚Äôt have power. What does ‚ÄúAssessment Complete‚Äù even mean on the outage tracker?
"77077 half of my complex came on a few minutes ago, the other half still dead


Edit: And now it's off again. Not even an hour

Edit 2: Spoke with a centerpoint rep about it on the phone and supposedly a technician is already en route to assess the secondary outage.

Better than scheduled for a fix I guess?"

77064 power just got restored
"77355, Stagecoach area

Still no power. Trucks were out in the area, lots of people around us reporting power on. The ""map"" says our estimated time of restoration is the 12th, but I got a text from CP saying our outage is being assessed. I have no faith in any of it. A fool's hope."
77033 - crestmont near gulfgate power came back around 7:30. A neighbor was told by CP there were no estimates on timeline (and we had no ETA on the map) bc of a blown transformer and then an hour later our power was back on
I'm new to adulting - is Centerpoint responsible for the infrastructure for the electricity and then we select our own energy provider? Never really heard about Centerpoint until the past hurricane.

[Texas Leaders Slower to Request Federal Beryl Aid than in Past Hurricanes ](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-weather/hurricanes/article/greg-abbott-hurricane-beryl-19565079.php?utm_source=marketing&utm_medium=copy-url-link&utm_campaign=article-share&hash=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG91c3RvbmNocm9uaWNsZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3VzdG9uLXdlYXRoZXIvaHVycmljYW5lcy9hcnRpY2xlL2dyZWctYWJib3R0LWh1cnJpY2FuZS1iZXJ5bC0xOTU2NTA3OS5waHA%3D&time=MTcyMDcwNTM3NjM1OA%3D%3D&rid=YWZlYThmZDMtODIyNi00OTllLTg1MGEtZTZkMDYwYTI3ZDIw&sharecount=MA%3D%3D)- a gifted link from my Chron subscription. ***Not only did Abbott fail to request aid ahead of this hurricane*** - his absence, [so reminiscent of Ted Cruz fleeing before the winter storm](https://www.texasdemocrats.org/media/flashback-friday-ted-cruz-abandoned-freezing-texans-for-sunny-cancn-during-deadly-winter-storm-uri) - shows how much he gives a fuck about Texas.

>Abbott's absence during a major weather event is unusual, said Darryl Paulson, a political scientist at the University of South Florida.

>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs standard operating procedure for governors of a state in a natural disaster situation to cancel any trips they may have planned to stay in their state and handle what potentially could be a massive state emergency,‚Äù Paulson said.  
In 2008, when Hurricane¬†Gustav was in the Gulf of Mexico, Perry and then-Florida Gov. Charlie Crist canceled plans to attend the Republican National Convention in Minnesota even though both had spent weeks planning their trips. The storm never hit Texas or Florida, but because it could have, governors from all the Gulf Coast states stayed home.

>‚ÄúThe governor‚Äôs responsibility first is to the people of his state and protecting the people of his state,‚Äù Paulson said.

>Abbott's office did not respond to questions about his decision to continue with the trip. In an interview with Fox 7 Austin on Wednesday, Abbott said he didn't regret staying in Asia and has been able to be ‚Äúfully engaged‚Äù in the state‚Äôs response.

>It‚Äôs ‚Äúthe exact same thing, really, that I would be doing if I were there in Austin, Texas,‚Äù the governor said.

As fucking if, Abbott. The dude is in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea."
"I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm now coming to terms that Dallas is a better city to live in than Houston. Sure it gets cold there but doesn‚Äôt get battered with TS and hurricanes.

Was able to snag a room downtown for 3x the price but it‚Äôll be worth it for them to cool off, get some sleep and a shower.

Parents house in 77447 still without power, but they do have a  small generator. Here's to hoping every one else gets some relief soon, and I hope everyone applies for whatever aid we might be able to get. Cleaning out the refrigerator and freezer today, if the dumpster ever gets emptied.... 

Also, what's with all the gas stations not being able to get fuel trucks in to refill?? It's not like the area is flooded any more. Really not understanding that part. So many gas stations just out of service now because no gas. Bring in the trucks...."

77045 power back on. Time for change.

Been going to the library for a cooling and charging station but that‚Äôs gotten old fast. I agree with a poster on here that said the food isn‚Äôt worth the misery. Time to think of a plan to move elsewhere as this has gotten exhausting."
77043 we have power but there is still a huge tree through our roof and management won‚Äôt reply when asked about follow-up.
"77085. S. Post Oak and S. Main-ish. No power, but a friend lent us their genny. So now we have hot air circulating, wifi and a working fridge. There‚Äôs power about 6 houses down our street which is making me even saltier."

77008 near TC Jester. Still no power
"77017 in Pasadena/near Hobby Airport. 3 days of no power, just opened our last case of water. All food is bad and we have ate out at 3 different fast food places the were (gratefully) open the past few nights, and snacked for lunch. There is power inconsistently strewn throughout the Pasadena area, including on Spencer Hwy. my dad, brother and myself made hotel reservations in the middle of the night last night (we went to sit in the car around 1am) for a couple of days nearby. I have two cats who I‚Äôve been monitoring and we will be leaving behind because the prices are truly exorbitant; I would do anything for them, but just can‚Äôt afford the last minute hotel fees for what we saw.

"77084, Barker Cypress & 529, Northglen sub. No power. Yesterday, I got a message from Centerpoint that repairs in my area had been completed. Got home and found that there was still no power. My power went out Monday morning at 5. Running a generator at bare minimum with a couple fans to circulate air. 

What's frustrating is about 3 blocks west of my house, some houses have electricity. The map Centerpoint created is a waste of time and resources if they aren't actually giving us timelines. Will I get power today, or am I one of those that won't get it til Sunday?? Entergy (power for other parts of SETX) provided their residents with an actual time line of when areas will have restored power."
"77469/77479 - 59/99 area. Most neighborhoods in the immediate area seem to have gotten power back yesterday and most stores look like they‚Äôre opening back up. HEB at river park and bucees on crabb river have been open for 2 days so should be getting relatively back to normal. Parts of Rosenberg and the front half of my neighborhood got their power back the day before, so I‚Äôm thinking they‚Äôre moving north up 59, at least in this area. Lots of cooling centers in fort bend county! Libraries, I believe a building at the fairgrounds is still open 24 hours, several mobile locations were available yesterday. I‚Äôve seen a lot posted on Nextdoor and Facebook so if anyone needs more info on those let me know!!


Edit: power flickered several times around 10:15am then shut off completely üò≠ I‚Äôm in the tara neighborhood. I heard they‚Äôre working on the railroad lines and it will be just a brief interruption, I‚Äôm really hoping so. Not sure how many people impacted but it looks like at least my whole neighborhood.


Edit 2: power back on at 1:15pm! I‚Äôm thinking they were connecting other parts of our circuit that had more damage."
"77006 - Missouri and Waugh no power since Monday am. CP map says energized, repeatedly online let CP know.  Have lost hope it will get fixed due to the fact it is a small pocket of houses."
"Spent the night in El Campo with the folks.  Bout to head back to be at work at 2.  If I don‚Äôt have power back this evening when I get off at 10 (at 77373) driving my ass right back down here.  At least I‚Äôm off Fridays/Saturdays so I can spend a couple of days here if need be.

Dealing with a 100m commute from El Campo to North Houston/Spring (one way) is absolutely worth not having to sleep in the heat."
Elderly neighbor's pharmacy is still closed (Walgreens) and they only have a couple days of medication left. Does anyone know if their prescriptions can get filled at another Walgreens? I tried calling a couple and no one is picking up. Thanks

77084 still no power. centerpoint's map is lying. neighborhood is not even partially energized. I offered to get a hotel for my parents and my dad is vehemently refusing it. Right wing garbage he listens to is scaring him that looters are everywhere and he has to defend his castle. Some defense. He didn‚Äôt even buy ice until the third day. Guess he like many others didn‚Äôt expect it to be this bad. But like.. they‚Äôve lived there so long. I don‚Äôt know. I hope they learn lessons from this. I feel sorry for their dog who has to bear the heat.

77018 near 32nd and Yale. No power but 31st and 33rd streets have power and it‚Äôs really frustrating.

I got about three hours of sleep on a metal bench in my garage this morning. I'm still tired, but now I'm also sore and stiff! Thank goodness! 

Woke up in the garage about 630am to the sound of someone banging on something. Jumped up all excited, ""it's Center Point finally""! Nah, my neighbor is tapping a piece of rebar on the concrete or something, nobody is here to fix my power. 

Might drive into town so I can go by my work and charge my junk, and sit in the AC, but that doesn't help my pets at all."

"77573 League City. Still no power. I've seen bucket trucks around the neighborhood. Maybe like 7, but since some of us have power and some don't we probably not high on the priority list. TNMP map feels like it hasn't updated at all"
"77339 Kingwood, Forest Cove

It's fucked. There's a downed pine tree over wires and a snapped pole behind Metro Self Storage off of Kingwood Drive. Don't think a Centerpoint truck has even come out to see it. Feeling like we'll be some of the very last to get power back

I'm guessing the workers going to stop  when the rain starts!
"Yall should be asking questions on r/lineman for power related issues. 

Also, someone needs to be asking centerpoint why they‚Äôre arguing wages AND why they didn‚Äôt contact every available contractor in the country. I know of multiple large contractors who were not contacted despite having manpower, equipment, and solid safety records"

"Power restored on giant apartment complex located on 7575 Office City Drive. 77012. Power arrived around 4:15pm. For what it's worth, earlier today, I did get an email from Center Point stating that the power around this region would be restored by tomorrow Friday. The message also did said that the power could be restored earlier, so that gave me a bit of hope. But now I wait, as I see others say their power gets cut off after a few hours or so. Just reporting from my perspective."
"77396.  No power.  A few houses across the street have it but not us.  I have a son with medical needs and I am nervous the more it goes on.  Hey-but the mayor and Lt Gov are mad too guys, from their air conditioned homes"

"77006 blessed with power but cursed with xfinity. For some reason had internet yesterday but it died overnight and no messages from them‚Ä¶ assuming that centerpoint needs to fix before they can even touch it, so wondering if that means internet will be off for a few days at least :("
77066 - Bourgeois and Cutten. I‚Äôm out of town but husband and son are home. I feel so guilty that they don‚Äôt have power and I do. I feel helpless. We do have solar and the batteries charge everyday but I‚Äôm concerned about today since it‚Äôs cloudy. I know they have it better than many as well.  I feel like those in power are using this hurricane as a political stunt and there will be lots of pointing fingers at everyone while the city suffers.
77024 - still nothing at Memorial and 610. We‚Äôre still in the Orange tier.
Any update on Xfinity?

Did anyone who was knocked out by the storm get power back?
I guess the situation is worse this time than the derecho bc the downed power lines are more widespread.
Just got this text: ‚ÄúFrom your CenterPoint COPE Team: Power cuts in your area are anticipated to be extended into next week. Customers are encouraged to cope with it. On Day 7-9 it is easier to cope than on Days 1-3. For meaningful tips on how to cope visit CenterPoint.com‚Äù

Why are people waiting in line for hours for bottled water? There is nothing wrong with the water. It comes out of the tap fine. What a waste of resources. Bottled water is also terrible for the environment. What am I not understanding?
[removed]
77007 Washington/sawyer.  Never lost power. Never suffered.
"Ouch. Allegedly one of Abbotts stops was going to be very close to where that deputy was killed, but it‚Äôs been changed because of optics. That‚Äôs horrible, it would have brought them a lot of needed attention and resources. Not a troll post, either. Ouch. They‚Äôre still making his schedule and trying to figure out how much rest time he may want or need when he gets back to Texas. International travel in a wheelchair is, believe it or not, quite tiring and the governor is not relishing the thought of immediately getting dropped into a series of multi day pressers in a recovering disaster zone despite his otherwise extremely strong desire to be on the ground here with the community."
