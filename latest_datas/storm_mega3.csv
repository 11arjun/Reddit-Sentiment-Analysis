"77098, near Buffalo Speedway and Richmond. No power since ~ 5 am Monday. Seems like literally everyone else around our complex has power but us. Such a tease seeing the big ass buildings on greenway with power and being so empty right now, would love their AC. Feels like I haven‚Äôt slept in days."
Please reread the OP throughout the day as I try to update with new information as it comes in.
‚ÄúI have power and air conditioning‚Äù is an extremely effective pickup line right now.
"Be sure to make use of our newest flair, Fuck Centerpoint‚Ñ¢Ô∏è"
"Does anyone know if the names of the deceased are released? I was following a homeless person on this sub and they‚Äôve been MIA since the storm. Tried reaching out and nothing. They really tugged at my heart strings and I wanted to help them out but couldn‚Äôt reach them in time.

This is the user and I‚Äôve been so concerned about them :("
77096 - still nothing. Waking up and realizing your power didn‚Äôt come back on is such a shitty feeling üò£
Ravioli ravioli give me the poweroli
It's probably cooler outside than inside atm if you don't have power. I opened my window and it feels so good. Just make sure if you're running a generator it's not exhausting near the window

"I think people would be more understanding if CenterPoint communicated better. 

I signed up for the ""alerts"" and only got 1 alert asking me to Reply 1 for alert? And that was 2 days ago. 

The outage map is confusing and incorrect at best. 

CenterPoint crapped the bed with Beryl."

77479 - no power. I can‚Äôt do this again tomorrow it‚Äôs too hot. I can‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôve got work deadlines.
"Don't trust Centerpoint numbers. According to them my subdivision got power back on yesterday around 6 pm, and that's a lie!! 
All my neighbors have reported the outage again and we still show in their website with power on. üôÑüôÑüôÑ

Have I mentioned today how much I hate Centerpoint (not you linemen, I love you ...but your bosses suck)."
Did centerpoint even work last night? I haven't seen anyone get power overnight.  This is so sad
"Wow fuuu my company made me burn the 2 PTO days I wasn't able to work. They entered them ""for me"" to ""help me out"""
Anyone else feeling a weird sadness about how few people checked in on you?¬†
how on earth is progress so much slower today than yesterday
"77007 Studemont/Washington. No power since Monday around 3 AM. 

My apartment is 80 and muggy ¬∞ (im glad its not worse) and my poor senior cat is miserable. I tried to get a flight for us home and it was going to be $800+. No family here, no one close enough that I would ask to allow me and my cat. Not leaving without her, obviously. Over 300 dollars worth of food spoiled. 

Frustration turned to anger turned to absolute fucking rage."
Hello darkness my old friend
"At the rate these repairs are going we are gonna have

Megathread: day 28. Beryly alive"
77077. Blue. No power. Melting.
"According to the centerpoint outage tracker, the number of affected customers has increased over the last 5 hours. Also, the color coded map they published is unchanged for the several miles around my neighborhood"
Hahahaha Centerpoints progress has ground to a halt so they stopped showing the last 24 hours stats so we don‚Äôt see the precipitous drop and replaced it with restorations since the storm. Got to make sure you keep the homes that lost power due to precautionary shutoffs to juice those stats.
Looks like it‚Äôs another 6 pack on the porch staring at the apartment complex 100 feet away from me with power kind of night
"The closest experience we‚Äôve had here in terms of a wind event was Ike, and the majority of people were out of power for a full week including myself. At the time I lived in 77098. 

For areas with more trees like my parents in champion forest, they were out for two full weeks. 

Centerpoint has given me no reason to believe they have gotten better at this in the last 15 years. If anything, they seem less capable. 

I think it was a mistake to not just be realistic about what people should expect, unless they were trying to avoid panic buying and other secondary effects. 
But the idea that half of us would be restored by tomorrow never seemed plausible to me. 

I would encourage everyone to at least get mentally and emotionally prepared for the fact that we may be without power through the weekend, or longer. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Don‚Äôt know how accurate their restoration tracker numbers are but only 9k restoration from 11pm to 6 am. Wtf. Centerpoint is the worst
Why do some idiot drivers NOT STOP at broken traffic lights!? Driving me mad!

"77034.  I swear it was on for maybe a few seconds.  Enough to spin up my ceiling fan.  

Or there is a huge gas leak and I am tripping balls."
"If you have limited cell or internet service, we will be updating this link that's easier to load throughout the day with outage news updates: [https://www.texastribune.org/text/DvVHvcXY/](https://www.texastribune.org/text/DvVHvcXY/)

"What a beautiful sight to behold as I was driving by about half an hour ago on Louetta Road, between Kuykendahl and Ella‚ÄîWhite trucks working on power lines!"
Houston transplants we tried to warn you it sucks living in the swamp!!
"Well, finally had to make a decision on the freezer.  Spent the morning barbecuing what meat I had left in the freezer (1.5lb of pork belly, a couple links of sausage, about 2 dozen chicken wings, small package of chicken thighs, a couple of top sirloin steaks, and a rack of baby backs).  

Brought it into work to feed my co-workers, so at least it won‚Äôt go to waste.  

The one benefit of being single and living alone is that I don‚Äôt have to overstock of groceries.  That was about maybe $50-70 worth.  So not that bad of a loss."
"I could understand if it was slow yesterday bs aside. Basically they spend yesterday getting a thorough assessment + doing some of the easier fixes. 

But today being this slow is just insanity. 

Then again they said they were confident reaching 1m fixed by end of day today which means they were expecting roughly 150k customers being fixed today. Which is such a slow pace"
"77007, no power and going by the useless fucking map CenterPoint put up - They haven't even started accessing the damage."
"77007 is still cooked, vote these fuckers out"

"I havent seen Houston in this state of despair. I went out this morning and NOTHING was open. People were fighting over gas in the few gas stations that were open. There is no streetlights which makes crazy traffic and drivers. Grocery stores and restaurants all dark and closed. Debri from the storm everywhere. No sign of trucks working to restore lights.  People sitting outside of homes and apartments because its just too hot indoors.      

 I also saw a line of about 150ish people sweating it out in the sun to fill up propane tanks. It feels 3rd world out here üíÄ"
"77009 near N Main/I45 .¬† Power still out.¬† Red lights on major intersections still out.¬† Set up the generator last night.¬† Got one windows unit running.¬† It makes such a difference.


@u/justahoustonpervert don't you have Tesla power walls?¬† How are those doing?"
77388. Between Louetta and Cypresswood. No power. 90 degrees in the house.
"77380 - no power, orange on centerpoint map. Slept with wet towels as blankets until my battery backup was drained from my fan. Charging that hoe in my car rn. Luckily my air mattress is waterproof. Hungry, tired, sick of this shit. Was supposed to start new job on Monday, thankfully the bossman isn't making me do anything until the office has power but I'm bored as fuck with shitty cell service 

77469 - no power, orange on centerpoint map"
77459. No power. I love this city but man this shit has me coveting other places.
"77077 energy corridor. 48 hours with no power. I took melatonin and NyQuil last night and could barely sleep. My sheets are sweaty and gross and I cannot wash them.

T-mobile signal has been spotty the entire time. I‚Äôm getting data right now while inside my apartment which is unusual. I usually have to go outside to get data. SMS and iMessage having weird issues leading to communication problems with friends, colleagues, and my out of state family who are worried about me. This sucks."
"I‚Äôm boutta start swinging if I have to go through another hot, sweaty, dark ass night while seeing the houses across the street have power since Monday"
"77562/77521

Day 3. Darkness prevails as all signs of power seem far away... All hope is gradually failing... The end is near.  

Real talk. This is planet bullshit. Centerpoint needs to get their heads out of their asses. I know the linemen are working as hard as they can, and I appreciate them, but something needs to be done about Centerpoint. They now want us to pay for the damages and restorative costs.  They fuck straight on off."
"As someone who used to work fast food I'm kinda surprised at the amount of people waiting in line at these establishments.

Y'all these low wage college aged kids are not checking meat temperatures from that industrial freezer/refrigerator. They more than likely just walked in there shrugged their shoulders and said ""fuck it lets just serve what we got"" despite the meat not being cold for over 48 hrs lol"
I FINALLY GOT THROUGH TO CENTERPOINT'S EMERGENCY PHONE LINE!! HOLD TIME WAS 10 MINUTES THIS MORNING.
These guys are working very slowly. It's been stuck in the 1.3m outage range since like 6 am.
Anyone else see the restoration counter on the outage tracker just jump from 985k to 1 mill mere minutes before the 5 pm deadline? Can't make this shit up.
"Just got power at 77070 by Tomball Parkway. The CP map still shows our area as Under Assessment so it‚Äôs not reliable. 

Any area could have power at any moment so hang in there guys, gals, non-binary pals!"
Well they finally posted that the map is not up to date. Took them long enough to put that disclaimer.
"I used to not get overly stressed or anxious‚Ä¶ almost ever.   I still don‚Äôt really.. with one exception.  Dealing with these weather events that we‚Äôve had over the past couple of years has made any sort of weather an absolute trigger for me.   

This was a hurricane‚Ä¶ I get it, but when as the derecho earlier this year, or the strong storms North Houston got last June it seems we can never be certain wether a simple line of thunderstorms is gonna fuck us for days or weeks at a time. It‚Äôs as mentally draining as the heat is physically draining."
Going on 60+ hours of no power is just soul crushing. Even if it was broken up it would be better than having to suffer like this
"77429. Power came back on for a moment and our whole street lit up,  then a loud BOOM, then we lost power again. Now our neighbors across the street have power and we're back in the hot damp dark for probably several more days. And literally across the street they have power."
"77429 no power, internet and very limited cell service. 48 hours and counting. Lost all the groceries in the fridge, the house smells like trash and ass. We are sticky and sour. I know everyone without power feels this way‚Ä¶but this sucks SO hard."
For the outage tracker they removed every statistic except for the number of customers affected..
"77018 31st and North Loop. CenterPoint just sent a text saying our lights are on and my neighbor confirmed that was a lie! 

Had a baby Saturday and have yet to go home. üòê"
"77008, we're back baby!"
I really feel for the line workers and customer service folks at Centerpoint. They‚Äôre bearing the brunt of the anger and frustration that should really be levied at company leadership and those that are supposed to be giving them oversight.
"How are y'all doing mentally? I really want to cry right now. The heat, lack of sleep, and general stress are doing a number on me right now."
"#centerpoint be like ""1M restored. Mission Accomplished"" ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°"
77584 South Pearland.  Power still out.  Neighborhood LOUD AF with generators.  I am 2 miles from PHS where they had the out of town centerpoint help.  Wonder if they're still just parked there.  82F downstairs.
"77379 - Hour 52 of no power with two elderly parents in tow.

Went from our home in Klein all the way to Dayton to find ice yesterday. It's mostly melted today.

Mom has pretty bad sleep apnea, so at this point I'm just praying she wakes up every morning.

I'm tired."
"77477 - Stafford, The Grid area, going on day 3 with no power, all businesses around still dark. Walmart on W Airport Blvd seems to be open."
77008 we just lost power again. We got power back around 11 and now it's off again.
Remember to check the licenses of anyone you hire for work on your property. There will be people out taking advantage and you want to know they are properly accredited. The plumbers union is aleady getting reports of fraudulent contractors.
"Even with CP inflating their restored customers number they only restored around 130k customers so far today, which leaves 1.2 million left sitting in the dark for the time being."
"77096, still no power and extremely afraid I‚Äôll be a part of that 350,000 that Centerpoint said they‚Äôd want to restore by the end of SUNDAY. Like come on."
77007 Durham and Washington. No power and no water
"77477 Stafford Run area still without power.

About to say screw this and move back out of state. The state has repeatedly demonstrated a lack of competency in caring for its citizens and my mental health is worth more than whatever this city can offer me."
"77037 Regarding the color coded map that they posted, is anybody else in the green but still without power?"
I‚Äôm going out of town on a planned vacation tonight but I feel very guilty leaving my folks in all this mess. Ugh
"My mom got a message from centerpoint saying to expect to be out of power for several days, 77011. But we know people in our zip code have power is this a generic message."
77077 still dark. I can‚Äôt take much more of this
Hitting that time again. It's probably cooler outside than inside atm if you don't have power. Open a window! Just make sure if you're running a generator it's not exhausting near the window. Be careful.
ARE OUR INDOOR CATS OK IN A 85-90 DEGREE HOUSE??
My place got power at 7PM after gruel some 60 hours and i just had a very long shower and made a nice meal for myself. Life is happening again. My heart goes out to families that still are in the dark. Hang in there. Just a day or two more.
77057- I‚Äôm over this :( I have fur babies. I just want my AC back so they don‚Äôt have to be warm :(
77018 North Loop and 31st power was restored about 12:45pm!! Finally.
Feeling depressed I don't want to go through another night with no power I have work I can't clean my uniform or take a shower. I can't book a room with no availability and I can't leave town. I feel like a trapped rat. 77011
Of the last 60 days I have not had power 11% of the time. I have power now and I feel incredibly guilty.

77054 - Holly Hall day 3 no power‚Ä¶ üíÄ

77012; still no power but the corner store and one street have power near me. Learned today that smoke detectors can go off if humidity is over 85%
"77018- garden oaks, still no power. Took my dog to daycare today just to give her a break from the heat. I‚Äôm so grateful they‚Äôre open and have power!! 

I‚Äôm a little worried about my senior kitty in this heat, though. Texting my vet to see what she recommends, I‚Äôll update this comment when she gets back to me bc I know a lot of us with cats are worried."
Crazy how some parts of Briar Forest have power and others dont. LIke right next to each other. How the fuck those this grid work.
"to anyone in the 77070 area, the willowbrook mall just opened up if you need some ac and sit down for a while."
77008 24th and Shepherd just got power back
77070 willowbrook area and still nothing
"Kind reminder, don‚Äôt forget to clean your refrigerator! Don‚Äôt wait until it becomes nasty ü§¢"
Centerpoint miraculously hits their goal of 1 million restored on the outage tracker before midnight tonight and they're gonna call it a victory.

"77095 still no power, had to go to work this morning, only got 2 hours of sleep, fuck this"

"77003 - navigation & Nagle 

No power still. I heard Eado edge got power yesterday so hopefully not much longer"
77007 - still no power (Jackson Hill Rd)
"77047. Power came back on for a split second, then turned off followed by the sound of a popping transformer üòï"
77406 (Pecan Grove) - We finally got power after 3 days
77066 - Willowbrook I‚Äôm in Japan but husband and son are home. Still no power.
77035 Westbury. My house is an oven and I‚Äôm an over cooked bratwurst.
Just saw about 20 trucks heading into the kingwood area
"Just got a picture from family that centerpoint trucks are staged in Fort Bend. Trying not to get too hopeful

Edit: Quail Valley in Missouri City. There is a Centerpoint truck currently at the memory assisted living facility on FM 1092 and Hampton for anyone with family there"
anyone in the 77077 Westheimer/Kirkwood area seeing trucks or positive signs?  got a message last night at 7pm that trucks were working in my area but the map shows my zone as orange
Wife just got off the phone with center point and apparently no one has called them to tell them it is a transformer with down lines as the issue. Also they said it was about 7 people affected by it so I‚Äôm guessing we‚Äôre at the end of the line
What‚Äôs the latest someone has had their power turn on? I‚Äôd like to know when to stop caring for the day.
"I wish there was a Houston ""bored out of our minds"" chess group so we could play some games with each other on our phones on lichess or chess.com apps. I'm not very good, but I have been enjoying playing lately. It's definitely something to distract from the madness and the heat.

It's been tough for me because I honestly want a drink so bad. I used to be an alcoholic. I didn't drink after the derecho. And I've vowed not to let this drive me to drinking. And I don't think it will. But God damn a cold beer just seems like the greatest thing right about now. 

I'm settling for warm Topo Chico I guess. At least I have a way to charge my phone. I know a lot of people don't have that."
[deleted]
Centerpoint tracker has barely moved an inch today
It honestly feels like they‚Äôve forgotten about us at this point and it‚Äôs making me want to move out of this city as soon as possible.
"Saw at least a hundred lineman trucks just parked in the empty lot at westheimer and fountainview on my way home around 5:30. 

I want to be optimistic that maybe they‚Äôre the night crew just waiting to head out for work, but I have only seen like 2 or 3 trucks actually out working since Monday.  

It‚Äôs hard to not feel like centerpoint is completely overwhelmed, unable to delegate effectively, and just pretending to be busy. ü´§

Also, 77035 (Westbury) is still approximately 85-95% without power from what I‚Äôm seeing"
77006. No power. Saw a centerpoint truck parked a block down from me but the guys stayed in their truck. They left 10 hrs ago‚Ä¶
"77459 Missouri City. No power since Monday 7AM. I borrowed a generator to keep the food from spoiling but not enough to cool the house. We slept in cars at Walmart last night. If we don‚Äôt have power by 1pm, we‚Äôre going to a motel. Many neighborhoods nearby already have power."
"77062. We lost power 5am on Monday. Still no power. Frustrating when it feels like everywhere around us has power, even other houses on the far side of the neighborhood."
"77064. I'm at work. Apparently they never lost power but the A/C is sketchy. There's a neighborhood down the street without power but I think the water treatment plant that they built the past few years is a high priority spot. Charging everything I can and freezing water bottles for my bunnies 

77066  no power since 715 am Monday."
"It seems like the Sugarland area has more outages than yesterday.

Still haven't seen a centerpoint energy truck in my area"

"77505 Pasadena/La Porte area.  Line trucks staging at First Baptist Church on Fairmont/Red Bluff.  Hopefully a good sign for those of us in this area.

Also a large staging area at the Target on 646 in Dickinson for those with TNMP.  

Still no power for me in 77586."
"77065, we have power now"
I hope numbers is open Friday I will need the catharsis
77007 any updates near Cleaveland park?
Centerpoint changed their dumbass map from ‚Äúcircuits assigned for repair‚Äù to ‚Äúassessment complete‚Äù what a joke of a company

"Is the notification below from Centerpoint worth anything in terms of expecting power back soon?

"77469 - got a ""several more days"" text maybe 5 hours ago, power back on as of right now"
"77586 is showing promising signs.  Trucks are staged at Clear Lake Park, the trees laying on downed lines in El Lago magically disappeared over the past couple hours, and I just saw a line truck working over on Kirby.  I'm hopeful we will see restoration soon, but I've been a fool so far.

I should also add that I've not seen a single Centerpoint truck down here.  All the companies have been from Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas and Indiana.  Embarrassing.  I feel like all the out of town workers had to get here before Centerpoint started mobilizing."
77379 Still no power. It's been out since Monday 7:15 am. So ready for this to be over. Edit: also does it not seem like the outage map has updated at all? I thought it was supposed to update at 8 but I haven't been able to discern any differences.

Just going to add to the line that cp‚Äôs outage map and systems are garbage. My account shows power off and the map shows me in Orange (just a street over from green so maybe a resolution issue) but I‚Äôve been back with no problems since 7pm yesterday.
So now the outage tracker only shows the number of customers affected‚Ä¶.wtf is this shit!!!

"77346 lost power 9a Monday. Currently orange on the map. While I get it would suck to have power and lose it again, I wish it were an option. 4-6 good hours of air and freezer running could stop so much food loss and help people make it thru these summer temps"
"77042 (Apartments Between Westheimer and Meadowglen by Wilcrest). No power since 4:30 am on Monday. All surrounding apartments on Walnut Bend Lane (including the stores in the plaza at Westheimer @ Wilcrest - Target, Ross, WholeFoods, Petco, 5 Below, etc)had theirs restored around 8 pm Tuesday but we are still in the dark. It's so sad seeing all the neighbors with electricity while we have to push another day in this heat. Will check into a hotel if power doesn't get restored by 3pm today"
"77036

A lot of homes have power around me..... neighbors literally across the street have power, but we don't.

Come on, Centerpoint!"

"77081 got a text about power being restored. Came home and it‚Äôs shotty at best. I think we have lost a leg of power. Ac won‚Äôt run, neither will appliances and lights go out after a few minutes. 

Need gas for my generator. Any gas stations recommendations would be greatly appreciated! 

NOTE!!! If you are having the same issues as me, turn your AC off. It will damage the compressor and motor.

77007 any update?
"77062. I just got power back on, but it still occasionally flickers. Not confident enough to turn my AC breaker back on, nor put the generator away. Having lights, outlets, and ceiling fans is a huge upgrade tho."

We have at least seven power poles down in about a four or five block radius, three of which were split in half completely. We didn‚Äôt see a single electrical truck and two streets are completely blocked off by fallen trees.

The Centerpoint map says our area is being assessed but I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs possible. Either way, I‚Äôve given up any hope of us having power back this week. We are strongly considering just leaving and heading north. We have family near the Canadian border so we might see if we can stay with them for a while."
"77063 and the power has been out since 6:30am on Monday. My complex didn‚Äôt think to mention to us paying for garages that if the power went out they have no way of manually opening them, so my car is being held hostage, easily the most frustrating part.

Any suggestions for a break in?"

"77005.  No power for 3 days.  1 year old in the house.

This is not acceptable for one of the richest states in the United States.  This is not acceptable of any developed nation.  Nothing has improved or changed since the 2022 Freeze.  The current situation is a direct result of deregulation and lack of any government oversight.  Abbot and his cronies are lining their pockets with ""political dontations"" while our families suffer.  Stick it to the libs

77479: Sweetwater looks to be ok now, I think the problems are along University. Probably should head north or south if you need to get out of the heat. Hopefully y'all get your power back soon.

An update from Facebook, there are three or four power poles that are down across the neighborhood and hard to reach locations. Centerpoint is at Campbell Elementary, looking at it, assessing everything.

Update 2:20 pm: I have the best husband and he took me to a whataburger that‚Äôs open nearby in Jersey Village. There‚Äôs working gas stations out here and everything, i just wish i could find a gas can to take some home with me. Still no power when I left the complex."

"77092 on the north side of 43rd st, haven‚Äôt even seen a truck and been without power since 4:45 AM Monday morning.  Don‚Äôt know how long I can hold out at home with the pets.  This heat is unbearable and I‚Äôve got to be at work after getting very little sleep again."
77388 - had CenterPoint workers by our house yesterday evening. They told my neighbors that we‚Äôd likely be waiting until Friday for power. They can‚Äôt get trucks where they need them and are having to use four-wheeler ATVs to get their crew in.

"77546: power is serviced by TNMP not CenterPoint, but they don‚Äôt seem to be fixing things much quicker. Their Facebook says resources arrived from Mississippi and Alabama yesterday evening. We‚Äôve been without power since 5:30am Monday. We‚Äôre fortunate to have a small generator that can run our refrigerator and a box fan but morale is low for sure"
Any info on available hotel rooms? Small pet friendly too..
77035 anyone? Rarely seeing this zip on here.

I was supposed to have our plumber out today to replace a faucet and look at a possible leak in the garage. That's obviously not happening. I have no power for him to see what he's doing in my kitchen."

At work (hospital) I have power and AC and have to be there and then I come back to a house that‚Äôs more warm than the outdoors. It sucks. I‚Äôve noticed neighborhoods and some businesses along 45 that have regained power on Rayford/Sawdust and that‚Äôs pretty much my only remaining bright spot."
"77070 Jones Cypresswood, my power is back on, I‚Äôm out of town so idk where else there is power"

"This is your reminder to purchase the capacitor for your AC to have a spare should it die. If you're even a little technical and can watch some youtube videos it's not very difficult to do and will save you a fortune. This doesn't fix all AC issues, but you don't want to be dying in August because a $50 part died and it's a $500 emergency AC trip charge to swap it out."
77406 (Pecan Grove) - I am on the back side on the neighbor and still don‚Äôt have power. Seen plenty of CP trucks but none in my area. The map shows green for me but my aunt it shows orange and she has power. The map doesn‚Äôt make sense to me
"77054, med center, still no power

Edit: for clarity, my complex has power, but a few buildings don‚Äôt, presumably because something blew, so management says we‚Äôre just waiting for centerpoint. Can‚Äôt even report it through their automated system because it refuses to recognize my phone or meter number (from their bill) as valid."
"77401 - no power, but i did see a centerpoint truck very close to my home! i am so excited & hopeful we will get power back soon!"

"Just got the following email:  

CenterPoint Energy and mutual assistance crews continue focusing on restoring power to the 2.26 million customers impacted by Hurricane Beryl. During the damage assessment phase we walked more than 8,500 miles of circuits uncovering downed trees and debris, impacting poles and wires across our system. We understand how important it is for customers to be able to plan around their outages, so more specific estimated restoration times will be available tomorrow. Thank you for your patience."

"Not from Houston, but was wondering if there‚Äôs been any discussion of the underlying issues with all the trees coming down beyond the storm itself. 

Things like poor drainage, root depth/width, tree types, poor planting techniques, etc. 

I‚Äôve seen discussions about undergrounding power lines,  but what about a thorough assessment of the city‚Äôs trees to identify what went wrong and what steps need to happen before the next storm and the next 50-100 years of storms."

Honestly I think we might see texas go fully blue for this election. 77007. Edit this got double posted oops xd
"Americans are too docile, too passive. Everyone in this thread should already know the first and last names of Centerpoint senior leadership, president, etc. The fact that you don't says that youre just not angry enough. 

And that's okay. But that's why things are the way they are, and why they will remain so. You just don't care as much as you think you do. All of you will completely move on the second your power gets turned back on."
