I kept hearing heights had it bad. This validates it.
It worries me we‚Äôre two weeks out from hurricane season.
"I've driven around a little, and to me the Heights, Oak Forest, and downtown got hit the worst. Much less tree damage in Montrose and River Oaks"
Those trees make me sad. Obviously less important than life but you can‚Äôt replace an old large tree like that in the same way you can rebuild a house.
That house in picture 9 sure was lucky that humongous tree did not fall into it.
Looks just like Ike
"Same in Timbergrove. So many large, mature trees are down. We were lucky, a ~60 foot pine barely missed our house. So many of our neighbors houses have been directly hit by big trees.¬†

The last time this happened was Ike in 2008, and many of the houses that took direct hits from trees were not salvageable and ended up being demolished."
"Unfortunately, the car under the tree in the first picture was my girlfriend's. She had just gotten the car serviced prior to the storm too. üôÅ"
If you draw a line through the dropped transmission towers and heavy damage it's a slightly concave up curve heading to downtown. This was incredibly wild.
I was absolutely shocked driving from the heights to the med center today. It‚Äôs like this massive line of destruction that just stops at Allen Parkway. Totally crazy.
I wonder how many insurance companies are going to stop new policies?
any tree/ecology nerd know if there's any way to prevent trees from being uprooted from wind? or is it just bound to happen
Pour one out for the FJ ü•≤
I can add a few to that. I was leaving the heights when the storm hit. The most violent part had a direct hit. I was in my car driving through on 610 and eventually made it to an exit to hide under the bridge at TC Jester. The wind was insanely strong and violent
Does anyone in the heights how power?
i was just looking to move closer towards the city.. i think i‚Äôll stay in the spring area now üò≠üò≠
not the FJ!!!
Looks like Spring Branch
"So many lovely, old trees in the Heights, so many lovely, old homes, bungalows...
When we lived on the 1200 block of Cortlandt, the old transformer at the end of the block would punk-out and blow at the drop of a hat. Like, storm on the horizon, wind blows, somebody sneezes or cusses and he was ""Audi 5000, biznatches, I'm outta he-arrr!""
And there was nothing important in that 'hood back then- no retail center on 11th or up and down Heights, no 4-door Porches passing by every minute (more like once a month, if that), and DEF no HPD presence that obviated their storefront off Shepherd, so we always had a week or two or few... wait to get the lights back on. 
After one storm, one weak storm, one punky, lil' storm Erkel woulda whupped one-handed, we spent two weeks in candlelight and a kerosene lantern before our wedding, getting all the little details in place. We had cell phones back then, but not smart phones- all our loved ones had to pick up and do the heavy lifting as we phoned it in!!
Heh, that was before a named storm, can't remember WHO, but we saw our new neighbors, Katrina refugees, walking down the street; they'd just parked their two cars up on the side of I-10, at the Heights St. overpass, in anticipation of flooding...
Love and patience to ALL affected! 
We got room out here in Brenham, just holler!"
Kids school in the heights got hit hard as well
Whoa I used to work in that building in the last pic!
Aw that poor mazda
I hope tree service companies don't fuck over people and jack up their prices to cut trees since now they will be in high demand around the area.
Wow that looks like a tornado
"I live in the Jersey village area, and the storm hit us pretty hard, but somehow we never even lost power. It was crazy bad I thought we where certainly gonna lose power"
Damn even more power lines down than I saw. We are never getting our power turned back on.
Hilshire Village was hit hard too.
Dam Electros lost a big tree too
Instant low rider. The hard way. üò≠
