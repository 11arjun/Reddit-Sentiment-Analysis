"""Get in a basement""
Aren't there like no basements in Houston homes?"
"If you are in the NRG area, go inside the stadium where the Texans play. There are no touchdowns there…."
Sky looks like there's a fight between voldermort and Harry Potter up there.
Watching the sky close to Cypress by 1960. It's non stop illuminated by lightning.
Cypress too
"Haha, I’m in danger."
"Step 1: build a basement
Step 2:..."

What do you do during a tornado warning?
I'm at the movies at Willowbrook... hopefully this building is safe 🤷🏼‍♀️
Did anybody else happen to hear that weird thunderstorm noise by the way???? Anybody catch it on film?
This is like the fourth tornado that has spawned out at frickin Barker Cypress and Tuckerton.

"That boom.was no joke, it was loud. 😳"
"That shit was crazy last night!! We live in Cypress and my husband and I were watching the radar track the storm going right down 290 basically. We were getting some pea-sized hail with the torrential rain, I have no idea how fast the winds were.

Thank God my son is a heavy sleeper 🤣🤣 And amazingly we never lost power! Our neighborhood is notorious for blackouts when the wind blows too hard in Hockley lol"

Thunderstorms like last night's make me sleep like a baby.
"I will say this is where Dallas has us beat. Their storm tracking and weather warning system is way better in terms of tornadoes. I mean every time there you can easily turned either a tv on or news radio and get updates warning and if touchdown movement. They have sirens to warn as well.

Here you just have to watch the NWS website and hope you don’t have to go to cover."
It’s taking cat and dog outside
Welp
"“Hey google, does houston have tornadoes?”



Oh fuck…."
If this moves over towards the cypress/ Katy area can y’all let me know please
