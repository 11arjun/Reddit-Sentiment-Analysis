Live in Houston very close to where this hit. Close to 1mil people without power and a rumor going around it could be out for weeks. 4 confirmed dead so far
"yeah. it‚Äôs a shit show in houston. especially my area in the loop. 

it seems like half the city is without power. i couldn‚Äôt make it more than about 1.5 miles from my house. lines are down everywhere. at least we have water. and booze."
"![gif](giphy|14pDS3FDDHZsyI)

A 2000s classic."
is there a name for feeling a mild sense of dread when looking at those towers?
I work for a large ISP on graveyards and every ticket I‚Äôve worked tonight is from Houston area.  It‚Äôs going to be a shitty night.
"Over a 1M without power, most roads are impassable due to trees down, 4 people died during the storm

Edit: only most roads in certain suburban areas on the north side of town were impassable due to tree and power line damage. Thankfully crews and neighbors have cleared some areas overnight and this morning. It seems the wind damage was much worse in our area"
"I am one of those without power. Ill be fine, but it certainly sucks."
It was crazy. I was in the office in downtown and I swear I felt the building g shake a bit. I noped the fuck out of there. And we couldnt leave the parking garage since trees and glass from broken windows were blocking the exits and roads.
"I‚Äôve lived here all my life and this one was intense and came out of nowhere. Half of a tree fell and totaled two of our cars and is blocking one lawn and driveway. 

I‚Äôm lucky we are okay, but I am stunned. We are so used to hurricanes and crazy weather, but this wasn‚Äôt even on the forecast as anything more than just a regular summer thunderstorm. I actually ignored the first phone siren for a tornando warning. The second one warning had me running downstairs and I saw rain blowing sideways and the tree come down."
r/ThatLookedExpensive
Visiting Houston for work rn. Watched the storm cause fuck it I'm in a hotel so if there's a tornado I'm just gonna die. For a solid 15 mins or so the top layer of clouds and the bottom layer of clouds were moving in two different directions. It was also crazy to see the birds leaving just before the rain started and looking like they couldn't control which way they were flying.
You must construct additional pylons
"been at no power for a while, don't think it's coming back anytime soon. goodbye fridge food ü•≤

update: it's morning and still no power and my food is still in the fridge üëç

update: there are couple powerlines that got blown down, it definitely ain't coming back anytime soon in my area ü•≤

update: according to Centerpoint it will most likely continue onto next week before the power comes back in my area. hopefully the food in the fridge will be OK but I'm throwing some stuff out. good times eh? ü•≤

final update: power just came back not long ago, hope everyone will be too soon."
this image is terrifying
Raphael Cruz spotted heading to Cancun
Wtf I live in Houston and the worst thing that happened near me was some branches fell
The people who are going to suffer are not the one's who deserve it.¬†
Tbf the Texas energy grid always looks like that
# Houston just had a problem
Shit. Be safe everyone. Love from California
Good thing they have the federal government to fall back on!
"The privatised power companies are so fucked up in Texas, check this out:

The Texas electrical grid infrastructure is in such a bad state of repair than pretty much any unusual weather could result in a power outage.

Too cold? Power outage. Too hot? Power outage. Too windy? Power outage... etc. You get the idea.

Now, this is an issue for power companies. Every time there's an outage, they're losing millions. To stop outages, they'd have to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to fix the infrastructure, which they refuse to.

So guess what solution Texas governor Gregg Abbott came up with? He allowed the power companies to price gouge Texas residents to make up the loss caused by their own greed.

Currently, Abbott has given them the green light to charge up to $9,000 per megawatt hour, or 150 times the normal rate.

So if you live in Texas, this is why you electric bill blows up every time there's a power outage.

I honestly don't understand why there are people alive today who believe that privatisation is good for the community."
"This is the wildest thing. I'm here in Houston, and I just discovered that a very large tree in my backyard was dead (I'm disabled and live with my mom, who also has health issues, so we're not exactly in the yard often to check on these things) and I literally just had a tree service out today to quote me on a removal. They're going to be out tomorrow as they said that the tree is definitely a hazard, and then this weather comes through. We completely missed the worst of it, barely even grazed us, and the tree is fine. Feeling like we just dodged a bullet, like what are the odds."
Damn renewable energy failure causing that tower to fall...
Your Texas Governor now asking for Biden‚Äôs help.
Man that‚Äôs crazy looks like a 345 kv line down. Wonder how it‚Äôs going to effect the grid. Also curious if all the relays did their jobs and tripped out.
That'll buff right out.
"When we were told we would be getting some weather, I don‚Äôt think *this* is what they meant. I got multiple tornado warnings within a span of 5 minutes, which luckily I knew I could brush off since they never land near me, though there was one just down the road from me (the one a few weeks back on Mason Rd. in Katy)"
"What the heck, I literally had no idea it was this bad. I just was sleepin‚Äô yall."
Never seen that before.
"So watched a news report on this.  Straight line winds started at about 80mph and intensified at up to 115mph before hitting downtown Houston at 105mph.  Possibly a tornado too, but certainly some very very strong winds."
"Any idea where in Houston that was from?
I'm in H-Town and still without power."
"That looks expensive. And because Texas refuses to connect their power grid to surrounding states, people will be without power for 10x longer."
"‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired, Boss‚Äù"
Bruh TEXAS is the wildest when it comes to weathers(n more)
The home insurance industry is just screwed and now add Houston to the mix. Jeebus this gonna be bad
*Ted Cruz has exited the chat*
"Houston, we have a problem."
"In Florida, the people are the joke. In Texas, the Texas is the joke."
I think Greg Abbot should have to literally kiss President Biden's ass before we give Texas any help.
"Knowing the insane amount of power that goes thru those transmission lines, this pic was taken way too close"
Summer has not even started
The langoliers are coming
Ted Cruz is heading for Cancun again!
Bunch of idiots in here pretending somehow their states energy towers would withstand tornados lol
Every post about something bad happening in Texas has an absolute cesspool of a comment section nowdays.
"Good thing they have Greg Abbott!

He‚Äôll pardon the weather and everything will be fine"
"I believe this happened in Cypress, TX. I used to live there, now I live on the north side. Still out of power as I write this."
"The Biden administration is standing by to offer federal assistance without any childish and idiotic political hate speech attached.

How awful!"
"Luckily they have their own power grid, so things should be up in no time. üíÄ"
Dayslong power outages if someone farts near transmission lines but women getting abortions is the problem?  Priorities.
"Interesting because these lattice towers are stress tested and rated for the wind speeds. Especially in Houston where it constantly gets hammered by storms. Curious to see if it was a material failure, human error or just freak accident. I build these for a living so genuinely curious."
I‚Äôm sure Ted Cruz is on top of getting this fixed lol
"Shout out to the those line men workers who wil be out there for countless hours on end to restore power.

Also Abott running to the government for assistance after giving that same government the middle finger is irony T its finest"
This was a severe storm it had nothing to do with the grid..chill with the jokes y'all people died. Edit alot of y'all need to touch grass as a liberal I am embarrassed by y'all's behavior celebrating natural disasters because it hurts Texas. I live here there are a lot of good people here just because our politicians are awful doesn't mean everyone here is also. And before someone says you need to vote them out or your state will never get better I have voted Democrat in every election sense I was of age to vote. I would leave If I could but I don't have any income. Edit Thanks for the reddit cares. I will treasure it always .
Daddy Joe please help us! We need you!!!
There‚Äôs a $17000 electric bill coming your way.
Here comes Abbot with his hat in his hands.
thankfully Governor Abbott has the power to free murderers. His power is on I'm guessing.
"2 comments. First, isn't this exactly what we would expect from Texas energy infrastructure in severe weather? Second, isn't this what the Eiffel Tower will look like if Paris keeps ignoring those expensive rust repairs?"
I thought hurricane season was over.
Houston may have a problem
wow. houston just had that flooding not long ago too.... im watching the coverage on it right now. I hope these people are ok. Hey houston if anyone is reading. reach out for resources. this is what we pay taxes for is to help others. never have too much pride for it pride is silly. i hope ur all ok.
"Good thing I‚Äôm not going to be gouged by the power company in my regulated power grid. - Nobody in Texas since 2002.

Looks like an extended holiday for Cruz is coming up this week. Republicans in power for last 30+ years and they will blame the democrats for this yet again."
Time for Texas to beg for that sweet sweet federal assistance.
I feel an increase in Houston‚Äôs electricity bill coming.
That looks expensive
"Luckily, the Saber tower plant is about 50 miles away."
Hey that's me! (That's less than 10 miles from my house) I currently have two trees on my roof and *can't do anything about it*

"Yeah‚Ä¶ the storms here were pretty damn intense today. Just made it home before wind intensified quickly, I was sure a tornado was about to appear. 

I hope those without power will be okay."
"I was browsing Wunderground for my little city in Ontario and there was the word ""Houston"" up at the top with a little red triangle next to it, so I clicked that and it said ""TORNADO WATCH"" and I thought ""oh I bet I'll be seeing them on Reddit soon""."

Well sending hope and prayers Texas‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Anyways!
Looks like there wont be any electricity for a month for those people over there.
That‚Äôs just the tilt of the Earths surface.
Seems Houston‚Äôs having a problem
The bottom fell off.
Oh please it's not that severe. It only took down one enormous electrical tower./s

No worries.  Our reliable nation power grid will ensure redundancy.
"Damn

And considering the last few years that electrical grid is held together with duct tape and popsicle sticks already"
I bet abbott fists the citizens of Texas again with his response
"Holy shit, hopefully everyone has their generator gased up. 

Did any hospitals lose power?

Suddenly all of those off the grid rooftop solar people aren‚Äôt looking so crazy now."
Go go Godzilla
Looks like repair work for the fine people of ERCOT
It was the Langoliers

"Oh no, not the Texans power grid!!

It was already on life support."
"Dude, Houston has all my love and all my awful memories of grid failure. Too many hurricanes. No thank you."
No federal funds. Fix it on your own.

"Thoughts and prayers and bootstraps, right?"
Gotta keep praying.

The storms will only get worse. How much worse depends on what we do about climate change.

Oh jeepers that looks bad
Why do I feel like o can hear this gif
Wish I could say I‚Äôm sorry
The video where it goes from day to almost pitch black is insane
And their energy infrastructure had a failure?! That doesn‚Äôt sound like Texas. /s
Houston we have a problem
That's that privatized power grid we know and love in Texas. Built to withstand beautiful sunny days....
And Texas being the state that it is run by the party who runs it and chaired‚Ä¶ by the governor who ‚Äúgoverns‚Äù there I‚Äôm sure will get right on fixing the grid.   They would never let people freeze or boil to death due to lack of means of heating/cooling or being able to cook food.
"The irony is that the red states will likely suffer the most from weather events, and their insurance costs will rise a lot. It‚Äôs not just extreme weather, but also the death by a thousand cuts from more frequent ‚Äúregular‚Äù events"
Houston gets dumped on for real. Extremely hot. Insane rainfalls. Extremely cold.
"oh jesus, given the state of the infrastructure of texas' ""independent"" power grid, i'm guessing this is going to be a clusterfuck for a long time. anyone on the ""ted cruz fleeing to mexico again"" watch?"
"I'm sure the power infrastructure is handling this like a champ... 

/s"
Power line tired. Power line sleep.
Don't worry. I'm sure the famously robust and durable Texas energy grid will be able to cope /s.
...when infrastructure is policed by the same private corporations that build the infrastructure.  Standards are thrown to the wayside for higher profit margins...but don't worry!  Abbot already asked Biden for federal tax money to clean up his mess!
Still want to secede?
Holy hell the videos: https://weather.com/news/weather/video/texas-town-flooded-as-storm-system-drenches-the-region
Awesome! I fucking hate Texass anyway. Hope it cost No Legs Abbott a ton of money.

Just pick yourselves up by your bootstraps.
"Oh that Texas grid, always joking around!"
"ok, haven't seen it in the comments so i have to add:
Houston, we have a problem"
"![gif](giphy|gLiJPmz9H6SKF0yfdX|downsized)

Thank goodness we have Joel Osteen to help all those people!!!"
Crazy... Texas is known for its robust and efficient power grid.
Looks like God punishing them
"I'm guessing Gov. Abbott has wasted no time asking for federal assistance. Sorry to exploit a tragedy, but if so it should come only on the condition that Texas agrees to join the rest of the nation's power grid. Getting their private system bailed out over and over again has to stop."
"Anyone else starting to feel like federal relief dollars to Texas need to come with a legal agreement by the state to upgrade their infrastructure and beef up safety regulations to protect its citizens from the bi-yearly energy issues?

Stay safe Houston."
"Where's Ted Cruz? 

Still in NY making speeches outside Trump's trial? Or has he booked his vacation flight already?"
Texas doesn't want to connect to the rest of the US grid.  lol
I would've thought Godzilla stopped by for a visit.
"Shite...we moan about the wind here in Britain, but..."
"It‚Äôs just taking a nap, it will sit straight up once it‚Äôs finished"
Abbot did say Texas has the best grid system‚Ä¶. Just a huff and Puff it‚Äôs down for the count. Feel sorry for those who will power for a significant period of time.
"I sad that political grandstanding to protect private profits prevented Texas from integrating with the national power grid, having more redundancy in capacity and ability to spread power could ameliorate some of the power concerns at least? that is what I think of when I see a high energy powerline tower go down like this."
I thought I saw Ted Cruz at the airport.
Imagine if Texas actually seceded from the union.
"Time for Texas to start begging for that sweet, sweet federal aid all of a sudden"
Those are going to take a while to fix. A storm knocking those over is no joke.
I was stuck in my car for the whole thing. Was insane seeing the wind pick up from 0 to 100 and trees start flying and the signs shaking and the power going out all in the span of about 4 seconds.
Those towers are supposed to be bomb proof. I guess they need to start designing for bigger bombs.
Holy shit iron lady down
Is GOD sending Gregg Abbott a message to stop being an asshole?
"Noooo, the I-Fell tower!"
Guess Ted will be in Cancun for the foreseeable future
as an electrical engineer I can inform you that they're not supposed to do that.
Houston is starting to have problem after problem and it's not even hurricane season yet.
Why would renewable energy do this
Good thing Texas' power grid isn't connected anywhere outside the state so that no other states will be affected by the power failures.
Uhh Houston? We got a problem...
"Something something bootstraps. 

Something something self-sufficient. 

Something something not relying on the federal government."
"Has anyone said:

‚ÄúHouston, we have a problem‚Äù,

Yet?"
It‚Äôs a good thing Texas didn‚Äôt cut themselves off from any national power grid or anything.
"Sounds like Ted Cruz is headed to Cancun!

"Quick, remove the words ""severe weather"" from legislation too. It'll be ok then."
"Texas: WE ARE GONNA SECEDE!

Texas (every time stuff like this happens): Hey Uncle Sam! Send money."
"Houston, you have a problem!"
Looks like Greg Abbott‚Äôs spine.
These severe weather events will become more and more common and Texas Republicans will keep pretending climate change is a conspiracy.
Too bad their governor is more concerned with pardoning murderers as opposed to the faulty electrical grid. https://www.nbcnews.com/video/houston-skyscrapers-damaged-in-severe-storms-211108421802
"Houston, you have a problem"
Not sure if this weather is actually severe or the infrastructure is just shit cuz the weather changes to anything unusual and then suddenly yall have no power everytime
Oh no! It's a good thing they are part of a robust multi-state grid that can handle the outage.... oh wait...
No doubt those independent bad asses will have this fixed up in no time! All by themselves. No crying to big daddy fed for the stalwart people of Texas.
Another example of Texas not being prepared for disaster. Y'all need to vote differently...
I heard Abbott asked Joe Biden for some federal help for Texas. I say thoughts and prayers for all those Texans. They elected that p.o.s. To be their leader.
They can just jack up the energy costs and never fix it.
"God punishing the people of Texas for being too woke, I guess. 

Yes, sarcasm."
"Thoughts and prayers, let them get their freedom grid back up without any of that horrible, obscene, no-good federal government money!"
How will Texas blame renewable energy for this?
![gif](giphy|BW03h8SCdT3HxvDs9d|downsized)
I've run out of sympathy for Texas and Florida.
Abbott about to beg Biden for FEMA assistance in 3...2...1...
And the governor who can‚Äôt govern has the audacity to ask the federal government which he maligns daily for help. Pound sand
God must really hate Texas
Time to go begging for handouts from Daddy Biden. So brave and independent until nature acts on them or their poorly designed infrastructure collapses. Remember how Republicans voted against bills that would help all these problems? I do.

Yet who ya gonna call when the shit hits ? Joe Biden that‚Äôs who, we hate the federal government, but come bail out asses out will ya Joe ?  Greg is finding out that Mother Nature don‚Äôt play. Climate change, fuck that. We‚Äôll vote against that shit every time. Greg ? Call up Ted Cruz if he‚Äôs not on vacation, maybe he can fix it. If he‚Äôs not got Donald‚Äôs dick down his throat."

This looks like a Godzilla movie or something. Horrible.
Love and hope to Houston and all of Texas from Sonoma County California.
Ignoring climate change will fix this fast!
Houston and bad weather don‚Äôt mix
"It's either caused by the imaginary global climate change, the Biden administration or God is pissed off at all the evil being done in his name by far right Christian fascists there.

Either way, I do hope that everyone is OK. I've seen first hand the destruction from severe storms and typhoons."
reminds me of the final part of The Langoliers.
That's a bad day

It looks like Mummy and Daddy pylon making pylon babies....

Why does Texas infrastructure so damn fragile?
"Houston, we have a problem"
That look important.
This is tragic and no one should ever have to go through this. That being said if texas were to suceasfully seceded they would be fucked

"I love how the fucking governor wants a ‚Äúhandout‚Äù, I mean federal help."
Texas power grid couldn't handle a storm? Shocking.
Wow
That's not good..... you can't put those back up in any kind of hurry.  If a 69kv line goes down they usually can feed an area from another source. This line is at least a 345kv I'd say and those fed multiple 69-215kv systems... so basically your fucked lol.
this looks scary af
They have a problem I see‚Ä¶

"My home was in the center of the storm for a bit there, it was pretty crazy. One minute it was partially cloudy, no rain, just not the nicest day. Then me and my boyfriend got two tornado warnings on our phones back to back and not even 2-3 minutes after that the wind was crazy and it was raining, hard. 

At one point the giant tree in front of my house was getting pulled by the wind. The branches were all twisting and swinging upwards while rain slammed into the window horizontally, pelting it with leaves. We got lucky only a few branches came down, and even then, no significant damage. 

My thoughts and well wishes to those struck harder than we were. Hopefully everything gets cleaned up ASAP!"

Did Godzilla just walk through?

It's just the cycle of the earth...
Thoughts and prayers. There gonna need it with Abbott and Cruz as their representatives
So question... As someone who may be relocating to the Houston area... where would you choose to live to be out of the way of all this flooding... lets say you were going to be working onsite at NASA and you wanted to be no more than an hour drive away... where would you move your family?

Damn i feel for you guys. I went through tgat in 2012 when that derecho came through. It was july .We were without power for two weeks. I slept on our basement floor for two weeks because it was the only cool place there was. Hang in there. Youll get through it.
Usually it just floods.

"Were they just unstable, or was the weather absolutely wild?"
"Seems like, this time, *they* have a problem..."
It‚Äôs God‚Äôs way of telling Abbott how much he cares

NOOO NOT THE EIFFEL TOWER
All I see is one pylon pumping another
Those storms were wild! We just got our power back a couple of hours ago.
global warming on an exponential curve these days? too many freak weather events.
I‚Äôm pretty certain this storm passed over me in San Antonio. It was 10:30 but it was dark like it was 6am.
That‚Äôs some Langoliers shit right there.
"Wild that we recently had the biggest solar storm in decades, and the thing knocking out power in Texas is just wind, not even solar wind."

If I was religious I would say this is god‚Äôs wrath
How many millions are going to be out of power for a month just so rich utility companies can be unregulated and price gouge every storm. Texas did this to themselves.¬†
"This happened in Australia about 5 years ago. Massive down draft crumpled a 500kv tower.

South Australia lost power for a few minutes, the line was reinstated in a couple of months, and still people complained bloody murder."
"Sorry, Abbotts kinda busy right now."
Ugh. That‚Äôs not an easy fix and represents a significant artery for many power customers/people.
Looks like Godzilla stomped through the power lines !
I scrolled down a ways and haven't seen the joke yet so I'll go ahead and make it. Houston you have a problem.
Houston we have a problem and not enough duck tape
Houston! We have a problem.
Is Ted Cruz at the airport yet?
Oh cool. I can't wait to help pay for that  with increased power bills (as a Coloradan) like we did with that stupid ice storm you guys had a couple years back.
Nah just normal ERCOT quality

"Houston, its not my problem."
For a state that prides itself on not needing the federal government they sure do need the federal government a lot
It a good thing Texas is connected to the rest of the country's power grid as a back up /s
And now they will beg for federal money......
"have fun being without power for longer than you would have if you didnt vote republicans in, texans"
Maybe Texas and the conservatives that live there should start taking climate change seriously...
I thought Abbott said climate change ain't real though?
Isn‚Äôt that how Texas always looks?
God's pissed Abbott let a murder free.
Don‚Äôt worry. Abbott has got you. Just a couple moths of no power and you‚Äôll be back to normal.
"All the empathetic liberals in these comments with their hateful remarks and comments about ""yOu vOteD foR hIm, tHiS iS yOuR mEsS""

"So much freedom, I am jealous"
Pity Texas can‚Äôt go 12 months without some severe energy related issue. If only there were 2 grids they could connect to to help with their power issues‚Ä¶.
Horrible. I hope the people get the support they need. Texans might be selfish assholes that don‚Äôt vote to support their neighbors but we‚Äôll still support them. Because that‚Äôs what it means to be a citizen and a patriot. It means you do the right thing even when it sucks
Seems like texas is always having issues with their power grid. Oh wait‚Ä¶they refuse to get on the national grid. Oh well

We are so lucky that God decided to land this storm in Texas where they don't need anyone's help and do everything on their own."
