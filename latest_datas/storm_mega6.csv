"Very convenient of them to mark “unknown restoration date” areas as a dark green that makes it look like there’s work being done, turn that shit red and then let’s see the map."
They continuously lied about when my area would get power after the derecho and lo and behold they lied about us getting power last night 
"Shout out to my fellow Houstonians in the teal.  If we get power back after 7/19, it is time for me to move 😩😩😩. 77396"
"At what point does the irrational fear of “what if they can never restore the power in my home” become rational?

77096, no estimated date, no power in the house."
"77388, Spring. Cypresswood near 45. Still no power. For the last couple of days they were saying we’d be on by the end of day yesterday. So that was a lie. I’m feeling genuinely sick at this point and I’m so tired of waking up with these headaches."
Anyone else have to stop themselves from treating functioning stoplights as a 4 way stop? Houston’s breaking me
Well ain’t that a bitch!! Turquoise Gang wya? 😒
"77077 briar forest and kirkwood, still dark and have been since Monday at 5a. I can’t sleep for various reasons but I’m also so fixated on when we’ll get power back. I can’t tell you how many 77077s have gotten power and per usual were last in the area. This has started to lower the home value in our neighborhood and will make moving even harder."
"If I’m going to be without power for over a week you would expect to see a fucking war zone of downed poles and lines, but fucking nothing. Just drove the full circuit from where there’s power to my house and it’s all clear. Too fucking disorganized to send a truck and fix a fuse. Fuck Centerpoint. We need to sue this shit show into the fucking ground."
77037 still no power. My birthday was yesterday. It sucked ass.
"Addendum:

For the sake of your mental AND physical health, not only go out, but talk to someone."
FEMA is accepting applications. Please apply!

"Reminder:

1.  Check the main post often for new information. 


2. Don't be in a hurry to completely restock your refrigerator once you get power. 


3. Think about your placement of your generator."
"77018- garden oaks- still dark on day 6!

Husband and I want to buy a generator this weekend, but I feel like they’re gonna be hard to find. Anyone have any tips or where to look? We want the one from Costco (sorry I don’t remember the brand) but I feel like it’s gonna be hard to find. 

I applied for fema assistance today which made me want to cry.

Update: got a generator at 610/Ella Lowe’s. Window AC unit is saving my life rn."
"77007 near St Thomas checking in. I was encouraged to see some patches of electricity in the neighborhood last night, but I might go crazy if we don’t at least get a restoration estimate soon."
"If you see price gauging (hotels, gas, for example), please report it. https://cao.harriscountytx.gov/Id-Like-To/Price-Gouging"
"77080. 

7 days without power during the derecho and on 6 now with Beyrl. 

My birthday was during the derecho event and my son's second birthday is today. We cancelled the party since we don't have power and still haven't sighted a single centerpoint truck or lineman crew in our area. 

They have power across the street from us and have since Monday night. It's insane that folks living 100 yards from us have had a mostly normal week while we've been left in despair with almost zero information about when we might even expect power back. 

Something needs to be done in Spring Branch and the NW side."
We can all bet our bottom dollar that our power bills will arrive on time this month. Get ready to pay up more and more for less as we all know the cost of this fiasco will be passed on to consumers. I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.
"77021 no power since all this 
My mom died on 7/11 and I can’t even go home and be comfortable at home. What the fuck is this shit."
"I said I would feel better having a date. Upon seeing 7/17, I was wrong. This feels so shitty."
"77373, Spring by treaschwig Kroger.. still no power 😞"
I'm squatting at work. How long before I can own this joint? I feel like the lady that lived in the sign.
"Can we pin this thread? 

Also, this may be a stupid question, but can they fix the lines while it’s raining?"
I’m so fucking over this shit and the fact that I have to do it another 4 days is actually unreal. Centerpoint can lick my sweaty gooch.
I45/N Main.   Still no power.  FUCK CENTERPOINT 
Probably worth clarifying when possible that the “without power” is really a meter count. There are roughly 2.85 residents per household in Houston. That means 2 million people without power.
"77007, we DON'T have a crew assigned to our neighborhood yet 😭😭😭"
"77024. Hunters Creek Village. I've been out since 6AM Monday. According to the map, today is the day. Derecho outage was six days. Freeze was six days. Let's see if we can't go three for three. 

Here's to hoping Abbott Mac & Me's his ass off K2."
"77025 Woodside. Crews worked for two days in the neighborhood, resorted most everyone: except 10 houses at the end of one block, including mine!

Quite the gut punch to get the ""power restored"" email followed by another ""we're aware of a power outage effecting approximately 10 houses, of including <address>""

My wife's first comment ""this means we're back at the bottom of the priority queue, right?"""
"77379 - bunch of linemen staged in the parking lot of the Klein ISD therapeutic and readiness center, also been seeing them running around kuykendahl rd. Hopefully they see the two downed poles next to the cvs Walgreens 🙏"
"After 3 days I finally saw a ""crew"" from centerpoint in the area again. It was literally just 2 guys staring at a lightpost and they didnt even have a ladder. 💀"
"I checked the centerpoint tracker before I fell asleep and it was at around 681,000 without power. 

Just woke up and checked and now it's over 690,000 without power.


Not a good sign that they'll have us by the weekend"
77092 - I'm pretty sure I'm never getting power at this point. All hope is lost.
77007. Birdsall st. No fucking date. Fucking bullshit
"In the Heights near 14th & Studewood, 77009.  Nothing.  Day 6. I’m so angry & defeated."
[deleted]
Centerpoint map has shown my neighborhood as energized for the last two days.  Not a house has power in it.  Rumors going around the 16th is our hope.  This is immensely frustrating.
"Fire Centerpoint. Fire Greg Abbott. 

Abbott has been having a great time on vacation wining and dining at fancy restaurants around asia with the VP of centerpoint while everyone in Houston has been dying."
"77007 Jackson Hill and Feagan, no power or running water in some houses and an entire condo building. The map shows a collage of colors and no dates on when things will be repaired. Seriously disheartening. ♡♡ stay cool everyone

Edit: I've had people check the area since the updated map saying some have power, the condo building and a few houses on the corner of Jackson Hill and Feagan are without power still."
77008 - west 16th near Yale - just got power back
"Map said Tuesday, just came up about 30 minutes ago. 77009, near Montie Beach Park."
Are there any organized protests anywhere?? I've got nothing else to do 😭
"Not that this is a great insight or anything, but a week without power is about 1/50th, or 2% of a year. 

Pretty crazy to think that this year many in Houston have had two of these events. This is the 28th week of the year, so if you have been without power for two of those that equates to about 7% of the time. 

That is an insane metric for a developed country, and officially disqualifies a city from calling itself the energy capital of the world. 

Energy outage capital of the world may be more appropriate.

Good luck to all the rest of the hurricane season."
"Missouri City, we got power and lost it an hour ago"
"I just filled my gas tank. If any organizations providing shelter need someone to pick up donated supplies, please dm me. I am happy to help."
77009 -Norhill. THE POWER IS ON!!!
Updated map has my area projected for July 15. A whole week without power. Absolute bullshit.
"77084 anyone else in an ""energized"" zone with no power? Theres no date and honestly just feels like we've been forgotten"
"I'm in one of the few areas left without an estimated restoration date. I counted my clean clothes to make sure I have enough to wear to work next week, and I'm trying to make that last by hand washing and air drying what I wear at home. It's so humid it's a bitch getting anything to dry. "
What are we to assume if after todays update we STILL do not have a restoration date and are pending review? Seriously going insane over here and any answers would make me feel better
"77096, near Foodarama plaza - we finally have power, came back around 3:15P.

First map had us in the blue (assessment complete). Second map showed an unknown date. Today’s showed 7/17 for date of restoration.

My fear is this power will leave again, I feel like I’m still living on some kind of edge. I’ll never see thunderstorms and rain the same away, and I’ll NEVER forget what Centerpoint did. 

My hope is everyone gets their power restored asap, and far earlier than next week."
"77007 Washington near 1-10…came back 10 mins ago after spotting Centerpointless trucks in the area.  FYI, i spoke to CP earlier today and they had a list of the work being done in the area.  The agent said she couldn’t give me a date, but that it was a good sign.  5 mins after hanging up, i got the CP text saying by the 17th I’ll have it back.  The lack of internal alignment is actually impressive…"
"State representative for district 139 is seeking volunteers for cutting trees for seniors.  To sign up or for additional information, call 713-534-4628


Added to main post."
"77043 near Kempwood and Gessner


We don't even have a date on the new map. Thankfully I have somewhere to crash with power, but my elderly neighbors say they want to stay put in their home and I worry about them. They have my number and I told them I'm only 20 mins away I'm happy to bring them food/water/anything I can but they said they're fine. They have a car and still drive so I can only hope the best for them. "
"77092 near 43rd and TC Jester, still no power and no signs of when it might be back. People real close to us have power but fuck us I guess. Just wish I could have an expected date so I knew how long to brace for. As always, fuck Centerpoint."
"77388 spring, off of spring cypress. Had power for 3 hours last night then it went out again. Been out for 8 hours. Power alert messages say crews are working on it but im fucking skeptical"
"77098 - Harold and Hazard. No power since Monday morning. Apparently CenterPoint knows about the outage, but the newest map shows us ""energized"" which is discouraging. We are with a block of about 28 homes, and the Phoenix on Westheimer which are all out of power. When they reopen and if you live near, plan a visit, I'm, sure they are hurting after a full week closed especially missing the soccer crowds."
"I wonder what will happen first? I get power, or we run out of Beryl puns? 🤔

Also, any tips to cutting up a destroyed fence to move to the curb? I'm guessing a sawzall will do it?"
"East 77008 near Studewood & 20th /Cavalcade power restored ~9:00 AM

Thank you, field personnel!"
"77043 - Still no power. Our neighborhood is the lowest of the low priority every major storm. Took over a week for power restoration after the derecho. Clearly going to surpass a week for Beryl. 

I’m so jaded on this city. Born and raised here and never would have thought about moving somewhere else until recently. Now I can’t wait to get out of here so my future children don’t have to endure the rampant incompetence in this city."
The # of customers affected keeps going down and for the life of me I almost don’t believe it because our neighborhood / area is still a powerless desert 🌵
[deleted]
"77088 Antoine and Victory, just got power back. Took exactly 6 days, just like last time after the derecho. I hope everyone without power gets theirs soon!"
"77004 still no power, even though centerpoint's map indicates that we do."
So I’m part of the turquoise of doom and just spoke with CenterPointLess. They said they’re waiting for a tree trimming crew to come out and there’s no telling when that will happen. Apparently the issue was referred to the tree trimmers on July 10th and that’s why they can’t give an estimated restoration time. I’m so over this shit
"77092 near 290 & Bingle - no power. Seems like much of this zip code still hasn’t been prioritized or even have crews nearby. The traffic lights on 290 & Bingle are working. 

Tried calling CP and couldn’t get a representative on the phone."
Just noticed the 16th and 17th were left out of the restoration timeline yesterday. Wonder why…
"North side update: 77379 is still without power (most of louetta rd and Klein area) if you still don’t know HEB has been open all this time and they have been using a small part of the store as a cooling area / device charging area, if you need gas the Circle K @ Louetta and TC Jester is open as well as a couple smaller gas stations in the surrounding area, they’re still packed but not as much as before"
77030 - No estimated time of restoration when I called. Does that mean we are going to be the last ones to get power back?
everybody in my area from businesses to homes are starting to get power except us. been dealing with this shit since monday 6am i'm convinced we're not getting it at least until next Friday... maybe. i have completely lost all hope
"I am out of town but just got a notification from my ring camera, so I think we got power back!!! 77008 at 11th and Ella."
Anyone have any updates on 77007 the Jackson Hill Area and Feagan Street? Ty♡♡♡
"just checked the new outage map. it says my area is energized as of 12 pm when it was 7 pm when I left my house and it was still dark, with no indication that they will come back and finish the rest of the neighborhood. 

fucking assholes"
"77389 - we got power, yes we do, we got power, how 'bout you?"
"77025 West Bellfort and Stella Link. Got home from work at 10:15 p.m. carrying my usual 5 lb of ice. The lights are on My place smells like a locker in 7th grade boys gym, so I have some work to do. Tip of the hat to the moderators who kept this Reddit informative and interesting. 

My thoughts go out to those who are still waiting. It's an effed up grind but you'll see the other side."
Can this post be pinned mods?
"77042, just east of the beltway. going on day 6 with no power. we were told by centerpoint that they were trying to get power back by end of day Friday. spent another hot sweaty night here for nothing. sigh."
"77386, 99 and Rayford. Most of the neighborhoods around us have power. The   CP map is nothing but false information."
"77075 power still out/ South of Hobby. 
Neighbors across the street and to one side have had power since the 10th and everything even managed to stay up through the thunderstorms. CenterPoint map shows everything is energized, but still no power. All of our food got trashed and pickup was supposed to be yesterday, but it makes sense that's also delayed so walking outside is pretty awful in front of everyone's houses. I'm surprised I haven't seen more animals taking advantage of the food. FEMA denied the application for aid so time to try and appeal. 

Struggling to find pumps that still have fuel."
"In my neighborhood, there were like 15 line trucks in our street for 5 hours yesterday afternoon.  They did not restore power."
"77092 - 43rd and Antoine.  Still nothing and no sign of centerpoint in the area.  Map doesn’t have a date.  I can’t afford to keep eating out, just got a generator from my parents but definitely don’t have the money to keep it running for another week or more.  I’m feeling really hopeless right now."
"77389-- North side of spring-stuebner, between falvel and holzworth. No power since 6a Monday. In the 'no eta' area of the map 🫠 neighbors are being friendly but I am so over the sound of generators all night.

Edit: HOLY SHIT IT'S BACK"
77007 - Near I-10 & T C Jester. Power is on but water went out late yesterday evening. I’m unable to find any info on it
77070 near Champions Whole Foods. The back half of my neighborhood got power last night but we are still dark. As is my mood.
"77096

Still nothing"
77036. It’s hot. I hate it here.
"77009 - still no power. My fiancé one block away from me has it, at least. But out of his small section of the neighborhood that has it, half of them lost it after yesterday’s storm. One step forward, two steps back."
77064 west road and BW8. Said power was supposed to come back yesterday. Everything around me is still without power. Map says energized. Nothing has changed in my area since Monday.
77005 - showing energized on the map but no power. I’ve called the same number for centerpoint 4 times in the past two days and EVERY SINGLE TIME there has been a vastly different automated message/reporting process. What a joke of a company
"77034 - Gulf Palms - Power back up at around 14:50 local time (2pm, almost 3pm)

I am... very thankful right now. It's gonna take a good day or three to get back to normal, but right now, just to be able to type this on a proper full keyboard instead of my phone is a fucking dream come true."
77008 - T C Jester by Buffalo Bayou. Power came back on about an hour ago.
"It's still much less detail than Entergy has been providing, but Centerpoint has finally started posting limited updates for their specific services areas, here: https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/Safety/Pages/Storm-updates.aspx?sa=ho&au=res"
"77040 - Bingle and 290.  Turquoise and still no power. 

Seems like every warehouse between the highway and my neighborhood is lit up but no power lights are working and neighborhood is black."
77096 - no power in Meyerland 8S.  Hope today is the day.
"77023 (Eastwood) - still NO power. On Day 6. Also, Centerpoint’s stupid map shows we are “energized”. Wtf!"
Centerpointless. Give us an estimate when we will get power!!!’  This is ridiculous
Power came back on overnight here 77088. Just hoping it stays on now..
77042 just lost power after it had been back for days :(
We had power all week then somehow lost it at 9 this morning.  WTF.  I literally just got a CPAP.
"Not local so idk if worth adding to the list /u/justahoustonpervert but Teladoc (telehealth provider) is offering free telehealth calls to people affected by Beryl. From the email:

"77339-Kingwood-Bear Branch. No power. There are 2 poles down in the Greenbelt behind my house. The rest of the lines in the area seem to up and ok. 
There are trees down all around the poles. It is going to take them til mon or tues to get the lines up according to the local line worker I spoke with.
The cross street to mine does have their street lights back and a few houses."
My brother got power for a bit and then it went out again today! 77063
"77389- Spring- Londonderry Subdivision.
Still no power.  There was a sighting of a couple of utility trucks but I did not see them.. this is a Nightmare"
77459 been without power since monday 5am 🫠
"New centerpoint map shows my neighborhood and others in my area as completely colorless what the fuck does that mean? 
6 days without power."
77018 near Shepard and Martin we show in the pending date section on the new pre-school map but just got an automated call from centerpointless saying to have power by the end of day 7/18 🙃
Anyone that has been restored and got an alert with a date beforehand- were the power alerts accurate?
77386 in imperial oaks just came back half an hour ago and its stayed on since \o/
"77008 - 18th and Seaspray - this is SO frustrating! Apts across the street have power and even some buildings in my complex, but not mine *cries Houstonianly”"
77024 chimney rock and i10 power is back on as of 2 minutes ago
77027 near the central market. Just got word my power is back! The estimated date they said was July 17th. So that map is completely useless.
77009 Montie Beach area. Just saw 4 box trucks going past the park towards Patton. Please power gods.
"77007 by Canyon Creek and the McDonalds on Westcott, I can see my smart devices are back online. Looks like power was restored just recently."
"Not as many updates here :( hoping it’s because everyone is getting power back

Still dark 77077 briar forest and kirkwood"
77373 still no god damn power. Gonna be a whole  nother week. 💀
A lot of people are saying to invest in generators. Is there an alternative or something people in apartments?
Do I need to get on Tinder and settle for anyone with power?

77090 Near Nanes and Redoak still has no power
"77345, Back of Kingwood, no power."
77099. My neighborhood is showing as completely green and the other side of the street is lit up. My side is completely dark and people still running their generators. It's a map of lies.
"77373- Green Highland subdivision no power. This is a new neighborhood. All the lines are underground so folks that say, if lines would be underground, it would solve problems. No it wouldn’t."
77015 - ded
77071 gessner and W Belfort. No power still. Haven’t seen a truck at all. No date on the map. I keep having panic attacks because I’m just giving up that I’ll have lights but all of my family does. I literally can’t do this. My apartment is so hot I’m suffering I’m missing work. I just want to move to an apartment with lights so I can have some normalcy in my life again.
77008 no power - map says my area is fully energized.  No idea what to do at this point
"77388 near Lemm elementary. In the energized color, but everyone without power."
I guess the CNP customer service team took the weekend off. Can’t get a hold of anyone.
"77007 w. 6th st, half the apartment building still no power"
[deleted]
"77018- literally moved in on Tuesday with no power. Went from “assessment complete, crew assigned” for 3 days to “partially energized” (but no one was?) yesterday to being a part of the fun teal no restoration date now. There’s a power line down in the middle of our street and it’s coned off. Huge tree branch on another power line. Haven’t seen a single crew anywhere near us. 😭"

"77063, Still no power in the neighborhoods around Gessner/Briar Forest"
"77389 - Kuykendahl area.

We did not have power this morning.  

Drove to the Red Cross shelter to charge up my portable battery unit and phones to get coffee and sandwiches.  Saw three bucket trucks on Kuykendahl, and also a worker with one of those long pole doohickey thingamajigs that are used to reset the breaker on a transformer"
77069 - Just got power back
Does anyone have news for the neighborhood of 77070 right at the corner of Louetta and 249. Looking at the map it’s planned for today but everything around it has power. I left town and am wanting to know if it’s safe to return. Calling stores near there seem to be without power.
77035  - trucks have swarmed the neighborhood!
Anyone else get a restoration email update around 430pm that includes a date of 7/16? Wondering if this is a generic message or not
77066 restoration date pushed back til the 17th
"77091

They're finally cutting down the tree on Donovan and Brinkman St. There was a whole fleet of trucks back there. Plus another fleet working on the other downed pole in the similar area on Sue Marie. 

I got hopeful that maybe we'd see power in 24-ish hours. Then received email from CP saying that they are shooting for EOD Wednesday July 17th. 

I'm going to assume the email, like the maps, are completely made up. Hopefully this Garden Oaks area gets power soon."
77042 - finally got power this afternoon around 3.
77379 near Stuebner and Spring Cypress came back on half an hour ago!!

Edit: back on now after a minute or two. Whew."
"77003, Delano and 45. Power came on last night!"
"77080. Near Kempwood and Blalock.  Lots of power around here but not my neighborhood. Half my neighborhood including my street doesn't even have a color coding let alone restoration date. 

We had line trucks on our street at least twice on Thursday and Friday. Power came on briefly both days. We luckily have a place to be until Sunday but we have to be gone Sunday afternoon. Not sure what we will do then bc finding another place to go with four animals isn't easy."
77021 - MLK between OST & Griggs / after 102.5 hrs of no power ours got restored Friday about 11 a.m. / fridge and freezer are likely completely lost but that's a battle for a few hours from now / still have yard full of tree trash and slumping fence filled with tree... Joy.
a few buildings of the apartment complex off of meyer forest and west bellfort were missing power is that still the case? can anyone confirm? 77096
"77023 still no power. Really hope that map is more misleading for us and not the crews to come fix stuff because it says that the neighborhood is energized when it is only partially energized

Edit: just remembered something, when I spoke to a centerpoint person about my outage and a potentially downed energized power line, I asked them if they see the grid feeding into my address and they confirmed that they didn’t. This kind of tells me that the map is absolute bullshit. I just hate the fact I have to trust this clown company to restore my shit despite the map tells me it’s already restored


Edit2: they updated the automated menu: the automated service said “based on your record, we can see that there is an outage present at [my address]” it’s now no longer just a report an outage and then you’re done phone call."
"77090 power back on 1960/45 area. Except my apartment building, I will pay you $20 to throw a bucket of ice on me. $10 if you spit on me."
"77043. No power yet. After Derecho, CP took 7 days to restore power."
"77037 and no power 

*Also ordered a Wii recently and no power to play it ❤️"
77025 just lost power again. Seems to be a full blackout of the area around Stella Link/Braeswood.  Even family who never lost power during the storm are out
"Another crowdsourced outage map:

https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/6bf34d1e7ff3442e956110715c7d0c08"
77069 still nothing.
77498 seems like we’re the only neighborhood in the zip code without power and no restoration date in sight 😢
"FYI: SNAP recipients have til August 8th to request replacement benefits for lost or destroyed food due to the storm. Call 211 or [submit this form](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/regulations/forms/1000-1999/form-h1855-affidavit-nonreceipt-or-destroyed-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap-benefits). WIC beneficiaries should call their WIC office for info on replacements benefits for July.

Also keep an eye out for [D-SNAP](https://www.disasterassistance.gov/get-assistance/forms-of-assistance/5769) (disaster food stamps) announcements for those not on SNAP. Typically after disasters disaster food stamp benefits are available for the population at large up to a certain income limit, but multiple government approvals are required to ok the program so it might still be a bit."
77098 Marshall & dunlavy- I am in a nested outage with about 5 other houses on my street still without power. I called and got through to a representative and was told that my surrounding “area” had 250ish houses still out and they planned to have the whole area back on by today or tomorrow.
"77375, Memorial Springs by Old Louetta and Spring Cypress. My part of the neighborhood got power about an hour ago."

"77064 - had power since Tuesday. Lost it for 5 hrs yesterday. Got it back. Went out again this morning. Centerpoint is useless. Family in other areas of the city still don't have it. 

Yesterday was my birthday and it sucked!"
"77584, Southdown neighborhood

We're part of a lovely nesting outage. Haven't had power since Monday morning. Our neighbors got theirs back two days ago."
"My neighbors have a giant tree in their backyard, but its branches extend a little into our property and are beginning to entangle with various wires since Derecho hit, and now it's worse. It's a really tall tree so we would need to hire some pros to take care of this. Since those branches cross over into our property, would it be our financial burden to take care of it?"
"77077 South Ashford Forest still has about 2,200 people without power. Hardly seen any trucks and CP rep says that it’s still waiting a crew assignment lol"
"77036 Premier Apartments on Woodfair, no power still, sadness continues"
"77023, Lombardy St., still no power. "
"77006- same post as yesterday, still have power but no internet and 0 communication from xfinity/comcast. Anyone in a similar situation hear anything or have their internet restored after being out?"
Lol anyone sued them yet?
"I’m very sorry I bought a townhome at this point - no generators allowed. We can afford a generator, we’re the end unit so it would be possible to get it far enough away from the house…the hold up is that we are not allowed to store gasoline or propane on the property. Something about a fire hazard, blah blah blah."
77009 by W.Cottage street. Nothing. No updates either
"77035 - Willow Meadows, still no power. We’re in the teal no restoration eta section in the middle sandwiched between partially energized neon green trees on the centerpoint map."
Saw a CP trucks around 77077 Briar Forest and Enclave. This area has power so not sure what they are doing here. Briar Forest and DA south is powerless thats where they need to go.
"77006, Montrose and Richmond

Finally listed as under repair for Xfinity. Outage tracker shows some improvement in the area"
77013 no power
"77017, broadway at concord. Still nothing. No restoration date given. I'm starting to lose my fucking mind."
Anyone have any news on 77586/Seabrook?
Any updates on 77373? Heard that there was a sighting of four trucks around the area

77388 next to Lemm elementary: just got power on
77070 near Louetta got power around 4
"77388, Cypresswood near 45. Was told today we would be up by the end of the day. The crew is working on the other side of the neighborhood, but so far have only been able to get power to the surrounding houses around the elementary school. It seems like that half of the neighborhood is significantly worse off than our side and thus repairs are taking some time. The new update from Centerpoint I got via email now has us at Tuesday the 16th. I’m really not sure what to believe given the poor communication throughout this entire ordeal."
"77072, the intersection at Bellaire & Dairy Ashford and its surrounding neighborhoods just got power back earlier today"
Let's demand the Centerpoint CEO resign and work to remove the monopoly this incompetent company has delivering critical power services! Sad to see so much suffering in the hands of such incompetence.
"77571- Still no power.

Stayed up late to check genny at 1 am to sleep in a little until 7am if I could.

Thunderstorms got me up hiding the genny from the rain and lightning at 5am. 

FUCKKKKK.

OK back to it."
"77077 briar forest and kirkwood, they just updated the map to 7/16…. That’s extremely disheartening"
"Still no power at my place. TNMP estimates 7/13 in the evening so I’m crossing my fingers

On the updated centerpoint map one of my buddys does not even have a color over their neighborhood 
Can’t be a good sign if there’s a color for “we have no idea”"
77345 Kingwood.  Backend beyond the heb  refuge.  Pending.  Guessing they know it will be a while.
"77521 - Near the hospital.  

Out since Monday like everyone else.  Have never been given a restoral date and CP stopped sending me update alerts all together on Wednesday.   "
New Caney 77357- still nothing.
[deleted]
77063 Ventura Lofts. Management said we would get power back on Wednesday. Well…..
"77373: Cypresswood/Old Cypresswood

I’ve been out of town since late Thursday night.  The Map shows me energized. I’m on the north side of Cypresswood while it shows the south side of cypresswood still pending review.  

Still haven’t been home, is this accurate?  Just wanting to see if I can come home this evening."
77076 Northline still down. The front block of my house has light but my whole role does not. Idk how this would be an I individual issue as plenty of houses don’t have lights but according to there ugly ass map we are suppose to have power.
"77074, Fondren and Beechnut, East of HCU, Sharpstown 2 neighborhood got power yesterday around 6 pm."
77006 Missouri St. small pocket of houses still without power but the map says we are energized. I’ve reported the outage online several times. Is it worth calling and trying to talk to someone? Has anyone with a “nested” outage in an energized area had any lucky with calling CP?
77042 (From Ring) CenterPoint is staging trucks at the Target on Westheimer near the Whole Foods
"77025 near Stella Link and West Bellfort. We are marked restoration date pending a review. I know what that means in plain English but I wish they had added some context about what three view process is and what type of resources are devoted to that process. 

That's the type of transparency that while not bringing power online any sooner would give some customers like me a way to process what is going on. Center Point is just really crap when it comes to dealing with their hostages/customers"
Anybody know where to return/dispose of the little green 16oz propane cylinders? Home Depot maybe?
"For people in Entergy territory, here's a copy of the Saturday evening update: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/ld29pba/"
"77586, Seabrook.

Power is on!!!!"
"77055
Wirt between hammerly and long point.

Earlier it had ""power back at the end of the day""

Now we're back to spending. Great.

Hope it's just the rain making them change this."
"Would like to get some opinions when it comes to a portable generator set up. First time using one and I’m trying to be as careful as possible. I live in one of those usual Houston townhome looking houses so the neighbor is just a few feet away. Safest bet was to put the generator into the backyard, on a level surface. It’s about 1.5 feet away from my house and the neighbors house, and the exhaust is about 3.5 feet away from the fence. The fence feels a bit warm to the touch so I’ll try to put some more room between it and the exhaust tomorrow. I know this isn’t ideal but how unsafe is this setup?"
"UH reopened their Student Center Thursday and you can get water and recharge devices there. The UH Hilton has been open throughout. They have a restaurant. You can also go to the second floor where the conference rooms are and usually find one that's open where you can recharge devices. But you can recharge devices almost anywhere on the first and second floors, and you get a comfy chair, too. The place is mostly run by students and if you're not complaining and act like you belong there, they won't give you a second glance.

UH has its own power plant, and never loses electricity or wifi. I understand Rice is similar but I'm less familiar with their layout. Still, these are important things to know, since we've barely scratched the surface of hurricane season. 

And don't overlook hospitals, folks. They have generators and they have food. Many now have had their power restored, anyway. Don't go to the ER unless you truly are in need. Head toward the patient wing. Wait a few minutes, then go back to the lobby and relax. In the extremely unlikely event someone questions your presence, just say your loved one is sleeping and you don't want to disturb them. Make up a room number. They won't check. 

Smith Tower Methodist Hospital in the Med Center has a meditation room that's always dimly lit, empty, and has huge comfy chairs. A person could probably camp there for days without anyone noticing."
"Hang in there Houston! We got power today, you will too! 77063"
"77077, power is back on. Ac is not working 😭"
Has anyone with a nested outage been restored?
"77041, no power but we are classified as a “nested outage”. Honestly feel like we’re royally fucked"
"Centerpoint has the new service area outage tracker. Im apparently in the greenspoint service area. Earlier it was at 120k people out of power, but now its over 202k people. How the fuck did 80k people lose power in half a day. The greenspoint service area is almost half of all remaining power outages in the city. What the fuck is going on"
77336 no power
"Is power back on at 77036 Forum Park? My wife got a call last night from neighbors saying it was back but this morning, we received a text saying the lights were all out again. I’m confused"
77029 Clinton park still in the dark literally and figuratively. Teal on the map. Who knows when.
"77377 

Neighborhood  didn’t lose power during derecho for but an hour in and out

Lost power for like 6 hours Monday, power ever since.

Not to rub it into faces, just curious on why more fortunate? Lucky side of hurricane? We have lots of big trees."
"77068 by Cypress wood/Cutten. Turquoise Gang...please kill me. About 1/3 of my complex has power but the others don't. Also that same 1/3 got power back at 5pm Monday, so less than 12 hours without power."
77008 Herkimer and 12. No power.
77345 neighborhood no power. We're shown to expect power by end of day yesterday lol. Anyone know a generator maintenance company? Going to be investing in a trifuel whole home generator. Already ordered the AC stepdown
77042 - Apparently two Centerpoint trucks on the south side of Walnut Bend.
77373 day 6 No Power
"77060
AIRLINE @ Busch st
No power"
"Those with power in 77055, are we seeing any Xfinity/AT&T repairs happening?

Obviously we need paper to everyone ASAP, my heart is out for those still without."
Anyone know if The Parker apartments on Memorial and Birdsall st have power back yet?
77024 fox hall is back! We’ll see if it holds
"77388, cypresswood near 45. Centerpoint appears to have restored power to a majority of the neighborhood and full power to the adjacent neighborhood, but my street and block are still out. The crew appears to have already left so I am feeling very disheartened at this point."
"Hey y’all. Just looking for some info. My wife has her own business - a spa - that operates out of one of those suites places with multiple hairdressers, nail places, etc., all owner operated. The whole mall is down right now, and has been since Monday (of course), so she’s out all her income, but still paying rent. What should be her sequence? Check her own insurance first (I guess) but if there’s no coverage for this or the deductible is to high is there a county, state or federal assistance program available?"
77339 outage/power line down in neighborhood. nobody has come
