"Heights (77008) - no power since the storm hit. A lot of big trees came down on roads, houses, and cars. As of last night, several streets fully impassable and that‚Äôs just in the couple blocks we walked around

Update as of 2:30pm: still without power

5/18 7pm: still no power, but lots of electric trucks spotted today! Near 9th&yale and along MKT trail

Hopefully final update 5/19 7:50pm: I‚Äôm at work, but I‚Äôm told we just got power!"
Reporting in for my boss over in 77079. has emailed me 6 times since 6:14 am. They definitely got power over there.
"77064 Jersey Village area, no power since about 6:30PM. I have not driven around but my sense is that most homes and businesses nearby are without power as well."
"77092, Oak Forest 290/ W43rd. No power since about 7 last night. Phone signal in and out"
77429 off of Jones and Grant. Cypress North Houston towards 290 seemed to have power as of 8pm last night same goes for the corner store at Grant and Jones and the McDonald‚Äôs near there. They seemed to have power so if they‚Äôre open that‚Äôs some food for anyone nearby. Currently still do not have power but at 3:20am we had a short surge of power before it went off again. Nothing since.
Salute to the Linemen working hard to get the power back on after the storm! We appreciate you guys!
"77433, Cypress. My neighborhood doesn't have power. But a few exits down on 90, there is power. 

We've been out of power now 12 hours. Do we trash everything in the fridge?"
77055- Spring Branch/ Afton Village Neighborhood. No power since 6:45 last night. Tree down on Antoine and all around. Most neighbors have moved trees so neighborhood roads are passable.
"77056/galleria uptown, I was woken up about 15 mins ago by lights and AC cranking on, we have power after almost 12 hours. Never lost water.

Edit: we lost power again but it came back on"
290 near Tidwell rd. has no power
"77024, no power and low water pressure"
"Independent Heights; No power since about 6:40. Pitch black over here

Update: 3:15 pm- still no power
Update: 3:21 pm- power restored"
"77035, no damages that I know of. We got lucky that we only got the tail of the storm, so we only got 30 mins of bad weather"
77008 heights still no power
"Centerpoint's [Outage Tracking web site](https://gis.centerpointenergy.com/outagetracker/index.html) IS working (at least it is for me) but takes almost a full minute before the numbers finally populate.

At 9:49 AM Friday, [727,691 customers without power.](https://i.imgur.com/138hHlD.jpg)  

I expect CenterPoint will get crews in from all across the state - it's going to take a LOT of people and equipment to get the power back on for everyone.

It's pretty impressive that the wind was strong enough to take out several of the big power-line towers.  Even hurricanes have never caused that much [damage to those structures.](https://i.imgur.com/51Ce8R4.jpg)"
77084 still no power since yesterday. Right now I don't really care but starting tomorrow we are getting summer heat days so that is concerning. Praying for power to be restored sometime tomorrow
[deleted]
"Grapevine, but reliable info.  The high tension lines that are down on the NW side will be a VERY long project, not measured in mere days.  That's the bad news.  The good news is Centerpoint put a plan in action that will have crews coming in from all over to literally build a set of temporary electric substations to reconnect big swaths of the service area comparatively very quickly.  At last report, Centerpoint has already restored service to about 300,000 points."
"Brit here travelling around Texas. Houston is our last stop. Was staying in a sky-rise Airbnb in the Rice Neighbourhood. That shit was crazy. Sirens were going off on my phone (we don‚Äôt get that in the UK!), power went out and then the downtown buildings disappeared in the black sky.

In our shared experience, can I be anointed as an honorary Houston-citizen?

Hope those still without power get back on soon. Stay safe everyone!"
"Who has cell service? I've never experienced zero cell reception/data for almost 24 hours in Houston before. I switched to AT&T 2 months ago and my wife is furious, convinced that Verizon would still be working. The only reason I can read/post this is because I connected the home internet to our generator.

Edit: as if 8PM, AT&T 5g has been working much better for me for the last 1.5 hours (77092)"
77011 no power since 6:30 but I think I hear power trucks nearby. There's a shell like down the block so I might walk down there to see if they have power or at least some ice when the sun comes up.
77007.  No water or power.  Anyone else still not have water?

"77447, no power yet, going insane. Taking care of my fully dependent bedridden nonverbal mother with no power is rough"
"77065. No power and news says we are probably screwed for at least half a week. I drove to willis and the Loves truck stop there is open and clean for a $20 shower for those who need it. IMO its worth it. I spent 20 mins in there and felt way better after since i had to do some major repairs on my animal enclosures after the storm (everyone is okay) The Loves also have 32ct water for about $10. The Loves down 290 is CLOSED due to a sign being felled on power lines. I was lucky enough to stock up on wet cat food (friskies) and 9lives dry cat food before the storm, so if someone needs a couple of cans lmk but give me a couple hours to respond as i dont have well enough power supply to be constantly online. 

Most if not all of conroe has power. I was over near Mezcal and the HEB thats near there is open. As with the walmart and many other amenities and restaurants. Gas up in conroe is roughly 2.92-3.16"
"I'm in 77012.

No power,  internet comes and goes.  Jack in the box on Harrisburg has power... it's going to be slammed."
"River Oaks and Greenway Plaza has power/ gas/ food etc.  The Whole Foods on Kirby is open (not that I shop there but saw it).  The gas station on Washington is open (on Shepherd).  Shepherd Walgreens near Allen Parkway looked to have power as well.

  
Timbergrove is shit.  TC Jester to 11th is a nightmare, trees all down all over 77008 but not the Heights-Heights area.  Entire trees blocking the roads, but I did see two tree trimming trucks this morning there.  Also saw a Centerpoint crew on E TC Jester this morning 7 AM. 

  
Hope this helps someone looking for gas/water/food."
77035. None of my neighbors lost power at any point. Had no idea the extent of the damage until I saw on socials that we were spared from the worst of the storm. Feeling very lucky and grateful. Hope yall are doing okay

"77043 - springbranch West, still no power"
"77433 - Creekland @ 99/290 power back on.

Saw the tornado forming in the field behind our development before running in the house. I was a small multi-vortex that got wrapped in rain within 20 seconds of it touching down. I got stuck in the garage because of the pressure from the wind pushing against the house door. Just glad to have power back after seeing the damage it did to the transmission lines in our easements."
Spring Branch (77055) power restored @8pm :)

"Mods: can we have a seeking help/advice thread sorted by new? 

I need to find a hotel room for a friend with a baby and no power and everywhere I‚Äôve called either a) has no vacancy, b) doesn‚Äôt pick up (maybe no power)

Does anyone know of a reasonably priced hotel with power that‚Äôs safe for a single mom with a baby? It‚Äôs too hot for a baby to sleep in this."
"77084 near Hwy 6 and I-10 - power went out yesterday but came back quickly. Wind blew down some trees and a few power lines. Haven‚Äôt left the house since coming home yesterday, as a downed tree in my apartment parking lot prevented my going to work. Currently pouring rain AGAIN."

77023/ Second Ward area just got power back not to long ago around 5:40am. We hadn‚Äôt had power since yesterday at 6:40pm. We always had water.
"77004- power is on, plenty of trees in the streets, on cars, quiet outside this morning. A lot of damage between Durham and 16th heading down to med center."
"Spring Branch, 77055. Trees literally knocked down power lines last night. Not expecting power until Monday, if I'm being honest.

Still out. Looks like Ike. I have small kids and we said fuckit and went out of town. Gonna be hot tomorrow. No thanks.

I'm tired. Too many catastrophic weather events, and hurricanes are starting next month. It's getting hot. It gets so fucking hot."

[deleted]
77005 - West U.  Never lost power.  All good.  Hope everyone gets restored soon.
">!77546, Friendswood/Webster area.!< What sucks is that the vast majority of people in my general area aren't affected, so schools and jobs are still going like nothing's happened and haven't addressed it, when our neighborhood has been completely in the dark since 7:20 PM yesterday. Waking up with the power still out was demoralizing to say the least, big RIP to all the ice cream I bought yesterday ü•≤"

"77003 - Harrisburg and Milby

"Katy (77450) - power's been out since the start of the storm since about 6pm last night. Supposedly it came on for about a minute at 3am then went right back off. So fridge is definitely gone :(


Friend of mine said his apartment is flooding near downstream from the Barker, so if you have property there call your neighbors and check in.¬†


Also if any of yall have a renters or homeowners policy, check your policy papers carefully. Supposedly according to another redditor some policys will have an exemption for spoiled food from power loss and will not make you count that toward deductable."

77429 Cypress. Power still out and ours literally never goes out ever.
"77007, north of Washington, but south of I10. Tree limbs down but powerlines appear undamaged. No power since storm hit (unless it came back briefly overnight and I slept through it.) Power failed in a series of flickers and brownouts- seemed like the grid was attempting to compensate. Internet connectivity via cell network is spotty- sometimes it works, and sometimes not. We still have water, but I'm filling some jugs just in case."
77007 has no power as of 10:16am. Assuming nearby businesses also have no power.
"montrose 77006 ‚Äî no power since storm last night, but water is fine. i‚Äôm going to sugarland where my mom lives until the powers back, which i suspect won‚Äôt be anytime soon"
77449- I guess we‚Äôre lucky cause our power came back on at about 5am and has been on ever since. My brother drove around the neighborhood and said a lot of people around here still don‚Äôt have power and are just chillin outside so no idea how the grid works around here.
77040 no power since 6:30pm. We‚Äôre averaging 2 outages a month so I fear we‚Äôll be the last to get power back.
77375 - Tomball. Still out. Really hoping it comes back on soon. Weird thing is it came back on about 3am for two minutes then back off.

Some tree limbs (or half trees) down here and there, but nothing blocking the main roads that I saw, no real flooding. We were without power for about 8 hours but I guess it was an easy fix."
77070‚Ä¶ our lights came on for about an hour but just powered back off again üò≠

Does anyone know what time the power lines fell across 290 last night? My father in law is asking
"77433/Cypress, I live in the new Bridgeland section just behind 99. I was caught in the worst of the storm on the HOV on 290 yesterday, thought i was going to die. Power has been out since about 6pm and hasn‚Äôt come back, but we‚Äôve got wifi and our fridge + freezer operating on a generator for now."
"77080 at Blalock and kempwood, no power since the storm hit last night but fortunately still have water. Went for a drive and trees are down everywhere, as far as I can tell power is out for a good 2-3 mile radius. Huge line at Kroger at gessner and hammerly, didn't check kempwood heb. Saw a few taco trucks with generators running with massive lines üòÇ"
Anyone know of any hotels open near downtown or hobby airport

77493 No power since the storm. Xfinity internet was working immediately after the storm but has been off since Thurs night.
Is it true that living close to a hospital protects you during outages like this? I used to be in 77018 by Memorial North and chilled through Rita. Now I‚Äôm in 77082 by HCA West and same deal. Makes me want to plan my moves very wisely.¬†
77007 no power since 6:35pm

Correction, target has power."
"Anyone else have power but no internet? Oddly enough, had internet during the storm and just after but went offline early this morning around 5am.

Very happy the lights are on at least, but I‚Äôm annoyed with the lack of communication from Xfinity. I‚Äôve heard exactly nothing from them all day. Usually I‚Äôd receive a text message or something with an update or estimated time of service restoration. I assume their facilities are having power issues, but it would be nice to know a detailing of the situation so I can plan accordingly."
