"Ike was worse overall but in terms of impact per minute of intensity this wins. It was fine, then fucked, then downright sunny within a little over an hour. Ike felt like several hours of chaos."
"This is the most extreme solitary thunderstorm Iâ€™ve been in, no question. Like a hurricane but unexpected and brief."
"I work in HVAC and was in Cypress when the storm hit. I was outside looking at the customer's condenser when I got a tornado warning and it was damn near sunny out. I went inside and up into the attic to check something, and in the 3 minutes it took me to come back down the attic stairs the power went out and it was pitch black outside and the wind was howling. Like literally HOWLING. Myself and the customer's wife and daughter sheltered under the stairs (I had literally met them about 5 minutes before) and I held the wife's hand as she prayed and I did my best to help comfort the daughter while scared shitless at the hell that was being unleashed outside... most interesting call I've ever been on to say the least."
This was the first time in 20 years Iâ€™ve ever been legit scared of Houston weather.
"I lived downtown Houston during Ike. The damage DT from today's storm looks way worse than it did the day after Ike. And it was pretty bad back then. I'll never  forget so many windows blown out on the one side of the Chase tower and all the glass on Main St.

We'll see how long the power will be out. It was about 6 days for me after Ike. The long lines waiting for gas were the worst."
This was definitely a bunch of craziness however I remember when Harvey turned beltway 8 into the Gulf of Mexico and thatâ€™s a sight I will never forget watching waves hit the exit signs at beltway 8 and town and country was absolutely mind boggling
I feel bad I'm in Richmond Rosenberg area just chilling no idea until an out of town family member checked in and gave me a heads up of what's going on! Some crazy destruction going on out there!
Is this another once in a lifetime event?
"Hell no. Ike and the winter storm hit me for multiple days, power and no heat for days was a pain in the ass. Wondering when youâ€™re going to get to the store again to buy water does not compare to this.Â 

This was terrifying, my car and house fence was damaged but at least I didnâ€™t need 3 blankets and clothes to keep warm through the night.Â "
The crazy wind and storm patterns... I literally saw the trees bend in the complete opposite direction when the wind direction suddenly changed. It was crazy.
"Idk, the Rita gridlock actually traumatized me as a kid. But this was def up there with the worst. Shit felt kinda biblical. Like a brief but intentional pummeling"
"Nothing was worse for me than staring at my phone all night looking at Godzilla sized rain bands park over Houston and water rise in my house during Harvey. Worst night of my life. 

Yesterdayâ€™s storm was harrowing but brief. And the damage done to Houston pales in comparison to what Harvey did."
"I've been here 20 years, Ike and Harvey did nothing to us on the norrhwest side compared to the storm tonight. It's crazy, just fucking crazy. One of my trees is half way down the street, the rest of it in my neighbors car. The neighbors behind me tree is now half my back yard. My neighbors brick wall fell down. Splat. Its insane. The sirens have finally stopped. Its been 6 hours of straight sirens in all directions."
"This is the first time Iâ€™ve had home damage from a storm, so Iâ€™m kind of in shock. Luckily I have insurance but itâ€™s not fun."
"Yeah definitely.  My wife and I are both born and raised in Houston.  Both 50+.  We have been through many hurricanes.  We both concluded that the winds were worse than any hurricane we have been through.  We didn't have a tornado hit us, but it sure felt like it."
Wildest weather even in your lifetime SO FAR.
"I never post or comment like ever, just enjoy Reddit. However, this was the first time I ever legitimately thought I was probably not going to make it. I got caught by the storm on the beltway bridge going North from Pasadena. I have a big truck and it felt like someone grabbed it from the top and was shaking it. Been through all the hurricanes weâ€™ve been hit by here in Houston and this was way more extreme and sketchier for the minutes it took me to drive over the bridge. 100% would rather deal with a flood every few years than those 20 minutes like yesterday. I felt like I had nowhere to run or hide, legit thought my truck would get flipped off the bridge for a bit. Crazy shit."
No dude Iâ€™ll take this over the ice storm again.
"Itâ€™s terrible but I canâ€™t rank this ahead of the magnitude of destruction from Harvey, nor the absolute chaos of Rita, nor the insane cold of the 2021 storm. The surprise factor is certainly off the fucking charts. I went from about to sit down  to eat dinner (thankfully dinner was earlier than usual, because we thought we had a meeting to go to), to worried my house was going to get destroyed in about 10 minutes."
Yea it is wild how messed up everything is out there. Are people still without power? We lost ours for about ten minutes on Westheimer near Gessner.
It's a good preview for new comers what hurricane level winds are like. Except it will last well over a day when the real storms set in. Prepare now!
Lived here all my life and I never have seen a freak storm that bad here. I fucking drove through that shit outside of downtown last night. I sheltered inside the new tunnels on Memorial until it blew over. Tree limbs were breaking off trees in Memorial Park and the wind just picked them up and they were gone. Crazy shit.
"I moved here from Louisiana and have dealt with hurricanes my whole life and can say with confidence that this was the craziest weather I've ever seen in my life! In the span of ten minutes - I got an alert for severe weather on my phone, looked out the window and saw nothing going on but asked partner if we should bring in the chairs ""just in case"" to huddled in our downstairs bathroom with my cats as we could hear trees falling outside.Â  Just glad that we got thru it okay with nothing but a power outage on our end"
lol this was fucking awful but harvey and ike were far far far worse. crazy to even say otherwise. i have two holes in my roof from branches and water in my house but id rather do this again than ike or harvey. this was not worse. absolutely fucking wild to say it was.
"This was more wild than that freak storm we had last year in the spring area that took our power out for a couple days. These weather events will become more and more common as time goes on. Get used to it, this is only the beginning."
"Iâ€™ve lived in Houston off and on for more than 40 years; Iâ€™ve never seen a storm like this. The devastation is shocking for the way it unfolded. The closest thing Iâ€™ve seen compare are pictures from Tornado Alley. 

With the average thunderstorm, thereâ€™s a warning. Not from the news, but from the storm. Thunder, lightning, something. There was no wind or rain here- everything was calm while we watched television- and the first sign that a storm was on us was the sound of pieces of my metal roof being ripped off and slamming against the side of the house. The relentless impact shook the whole upstairs. 

It was insane. Just 0 to 100 literally."
"I mean you say that, but a bad hurricane spawns a shit ton of tornadoes. There's a couple specific streets specifically here in KW where were completely devastated after Ike because of all the secondary tornadoes."
"I had to drive from The Woodlands to 290 and Tidwell as Harvey made landfall.    I would much rather drive through that again than go through the ten minutes of sheer terror I just went through.  My wife and I were in our driveway in our truck after a doctor's appointment, when the skies just opened up, the wind blew trees into the aerial power lines behind our house and killed our subdivision's power.  I looked at the videos from our security cameras, the storm started at 6:10 and ended at 6:30 but it managed a lot of sheer destruction in that short window.  All of my adjacent neighbors have tree damage, two lost entire trees, one lost one of the primary branches off the root trunk.  Our fence is not long for this world either, one of the trees tried to push it over.  It now leans at a worrying 50 degrees..."
"Damn I moved to Houston a year and a half ago and I thought this was not normal but not as bad as you guys have seen before. Gotta say Iâ€™m glad itâ€™s not normal.

I drove through the eye of the fuckin storm. Good lord my car was getting pushed left and then right to the side multiple feet..  driving 15 mph. Finally managed to get off 610 and hid at the underpass on tc jester. And then got stuck behind traffic with a downed power line across 290. I saw green flashes from multiple transformers exploding. When I left the underpass there were trees and building panels all over the road. That shit was wild"
Iâ€™m downtown. Glass everywhere. But we have power! Lol
"Driving around downtown after the 30 ish minutes of super intense weather was kind of haunting. Almost everywhere has their power out, traffic lights and streetlights are out, building damage and giant trees laid over in to the road."
I got stuck at the gym and literally watched the storm roll in. Scariest moment of my life but I definitely got some gains in ðŸ˜ªðŸ˜‚
Were you here for Hurricane Ike in 2008? If not this is a foreshadowing for this high output hurricane season 2024
Not from Houston been down here 10 years. This is the first time I was scared of the weather. I was in my car under an overpass on I-10 when it all hit
Come on. Ike was incredible in terms of wind and fury compared to this
I was driving through it as it was rolling through Brenham (Literally had no idea it was going to be THAT bad)- It was certainly a top 3 weather event for me as well- the last two times I got caught on the road like that and it would be comparable would be the Tax Day flood and a out of nowhere storm I got caught up in trying to leave Corpus Christi a few years back.
My big ass tree is now in my attached garage with my car
"I don't know man, Houston's steady state when it comes to weather seems to be chaos, partial recovery, chaos. I have seen some absolutely insane weather here, and one of the rain cells during Harvey was over where I am southside. That is still one of the craziest events I've seen. But I suspect if you are in the Heights or that triangle north of Downtown between i10 and 290, yesterday was insane (while Harvey wasn't much of anything.)"
"Out of curiosity, why is the weather so bad in Houston this year?

I was flying United and inbound aircraft was coming in from Houston, ended up being delayed 3.5 hours. I checked the weather and it seemed like there was a thunderstorm every single day. Why is it so much worse this year compared to previous years?"

"Do **Not** go to HEB tomorrow. Their power is out too. Cold canned food it is. If thereâ€™s even still a road, probably not gonna happen anyway."
Frank Billingsley going out with an absolute bang
Did a tornado actually touchdown anywhere? I think most of this was high winds not a tornado
I was inside a brick building the entire time and couldnâ€™t eceb tell there was 70 mile winds outside  â€¦ that needs to be the standard of all homes in Houston
"This definitely reminded me of bad hurricanes back in South Louisiana where Iâ€™m from. I definitely need to restock on batteries, flashlights and fans. The memorial area where I am got rocked."
"The big deal here was how sudden and seemingly out of nowhere it was. I was working and had a movie on and heard a loud beeping that I thought was the movie for a good while. I looked at my phone, and it was like tornado, seek shelter now! And I was like wtf. With other major storms, we've had some warning--well, sort of except for Allison, at least for me (I wasn't keeping up with the news).

As bad as this was, the trauma from Allison was so very real...and then the Memorial and Tax Day floods, I lost a car and my building flooded both times, and I got to where if it was raining heavily, I'd have anxiety attacks that everything was flooding again and couldn't sleep. With Ike, I was hiding in my closet. The sky was green. There were horrible noises all around for hours and I was scared my roof was going to come off."
I heard this post quoted on NPR this morning. Knew it must be from here.
They keep saying it wasnâ€™t a twister .. but it sure Acted like one..
Just moved from Oklahoma not long ago.  Felt a lot like tornado season storms.
"This is probably the first time ever my area wasnâ€™t affected by a big storm. Iâ€™ve lived through all of the above here. Harvey was the worst. Had to be rescued out of my home. Today it was just like a regular thunderstorm. Sorry to everyone dealing with this. Good
Luck! Iâ€™ve definitely been there"
"I grew up in tornado alley. I honestly didn't think this was that big of a deal compared to past weather events in Houston I've been here for, but also, I don't live north of i10 where I heard it really went off."
"I was driving back from Baytown and I did not feel as much fear as I should have. 

I was resigned to it. 

""Oh, damn, this is a lot... should probably get away from this semi"""
We got super lucky. Finished eating at Texas Roadhouse while the wall of water went through. Then drove around some broken tree branches to get home.
"I was in the gym sauna, had absolutely no idea it was even supposed to rain. 

I go to leave the gym and thereâ€™s a crowd of about a dozen people and I see trees whipping around outside. It passed really quickly so I didnt think much of it, but got home and there was no power and tree limbs down. 

Whatâ€™s up with these random ass intense as fuck storms?? Iâ€™ve lost power twice now in two weeks from the storms 

Iâ€™m not excited about storm season"
"I'm acutely aware when it comes to weather changes during this time of year. 

Habitually, one of the things I do is check the weather forecasts.

Depending on the direction it's coming from and the size of the event, I'll pay more attention to it. 

I learned my lesson when Allison snuck up on me."
"I'm 33 years old and I've lived in Houston my entire life, born and raised. I've never seen weather like yesterday evening, literally NEVER!!!!!"
"Trees fell and closed off our street, aall the men on our street including myself brougbt out machetes hatchets, axes, saws and did everything we could to clear the street! They knocked down the power lines so our recent trip to Samâ€™s Club is down the drain. A tree in our back yard is completely out of the ground and a tree in our driveway landed INCHES from my truck when it fell. Truly a crazy experience! My wife had been at a hotel downtown celebrating a week long Motherâ€™s Day with our daughter arriving there yesterday morning. All this to say, Iâ€™m glad they were somewhere that was mostly unaffected, I drove from NE Houston to downtown and it was pitch black. the devastation we witnessed the morning was unreal."
"There was a tornado? Well, that gives some context to the text my dad apparently left a few hours ago."
"I didn't feel to much down here in League City on the water. Guess we got the backside or something sky was a little green and a ton of lightning, but not too much wind."
"Myabe I have to get outside, but that was 10 minutes of strong wind and a lot of rain with the lights flickering a bit while I ate dinner. On the other hand I still have PTSD from Harvey. I didn't have power water or heat for almost a week in the second to last winter freeze. What am I missing."
Harvey was fucking horrifying but this shit was so sudden Iâ€™m like still processing how insane it was
Those tornadoes that hit south Hou and Pasadena last Jan was the weirdest....tore my apt complex up smh
"I was in the path of the worst wind (Shady Acres/Heights) and it was legitimately scary. In Houston since 2007, so I have several events to compare to."
How was Hurricane Beryl
Ike and Harvey were much longer lasting and harder to live through. The 2021 freeze was the absolute worst. The 2015 Memorial Day floods devestated my home. But Last night? The McDonalds line was too long and I had to sleep with a window open. Obviously each diaster impacts people differently. Id still say it was a top 5 event though. Number 5 for me.
This is not worse than hurricane harvey. Would really take a hurricane over a tornado??? Ive lived through all those storms you listed and nothing comes close to hurricane harvey.
