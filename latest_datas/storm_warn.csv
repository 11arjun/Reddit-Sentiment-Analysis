"It's national and international news reports like this that always seem to end up having me remind family and friends in other parts of the country that the Houston Metro Area is about the size of Massachusetts, and while there is flooding in some areas, it's fine where I live."
My whole house flooded in Porter we lost all of our stuff as we just moved in and everything was on the floor
"My sisters road in Kingwood was flooded up to the curb yesterday at 4 pm, meanwhile I was sat with hubby at the bar patio inside the loop enjoying a drink while chatting with her.   They were at that time just about to open the second flood gates!    This morning where I am the thunder is very loud and the rain is torrential, but no flooding, I’m just hoping it doesn’t rise that much for her today"
Meanwhile Braes Bayou is barely even up
"And now queue the lawsuits between the people that live on lake Conroe that don't want to flood and the people downstream that don't want the dam to release water so lake Conroe doesn't flood. Ah, summer in Houston."
So... I shouldn't go out for Cinco de Mayo?
Aaaaand this is why homeowners insurance providers are starting to pull out of the Houston area.
"There must be CEOs who decided not to relocate to Houston because of multiple ""100-year floods"" in the last 30 years.

""But it doesn't flood in [insert area of town].""

How do workers in flooded areas get to their jobs? Are roads, freeways and public transportation affected? Is flood insurance, if available,  affordable? What's the cost of standard homeowner insurance? What about all the bad actors who clean up totaled/flooded cars and try to sell them?

Blanket, nationwide coverage like this is bad PR. It can't be spun with ""It's OK here,"" or ""It's not a hurricane.""

Hurricane season starts on June 1."
