"Their exact words were ""CenterPoint now expects to have 1 million impacted customers restored by the end of the day on Wednesday, July 10.""

Since over 2 million of their customers lost power that is less than half fixed by the end of the 10th."
"I feel you dawg! I’m going to start saving at least $5,000 yearly to evacuate to another state. Losing power is one of my biggest pet peeves"
I'm looking to move soon.  One sneeze and the power is out for a week.  Lose all groceries AGAIN.  4TH Largest city in America with the power grid of a 3rd world country.  It's embarrassing at this point.  I'm over it.
"Where the hell are all of our taxes dollars going? We voted for increased tax for flood mitigation years ago… nothing. Taxes and higher power rates to improve our electric grid and infrastructure… nothing. 

We are paying the money to fix the issues and nothing is being done."
"Born and raised in Houston, but I left after Harvey. These floods and hurricanes are gonna keep happening more and more frequently until it's just another summer day."
"There's a certain cultural apathy in Houston that I really fucking hate, even though it's partially a consequence of a laid-back attitude that I love. It impacts a lot of areas of life, and we really pay for it at times like this. I keep hoping for more civic engagement, more *community*, but I just don't know."
I feel the same way. Been here about 15 years now and its just getting worse.
Houstonians feeling the exhaustion of being 'Houston strong' all the time.
"Thanks Abbott.Billions on the border ,all for show,but  refuses to fix the grid.All so his energy company co contributors can keep fleecing consumers in time of weather related calamity"
"After living and loving this city for almost 50 yrs am done this time. WE are planning to move . Incredible a modern American city is so mishandled and the power companies so ill prepared. 

Also there is absolutely NO WAy this city could be evacuated if need be, just look at constant everyday traffic...."
"I love Houston and I miss it, but this is the #1 reason we got the \*\*\*\* out!!  Lived there 16 years but after the freeze and multiple storms, we had enough!  I feel for everyone.. i bet there's more big storms on the way this year."
"The reality is that the rural voters outnumber the urban ones who care about these things. At a state level, the government just doesn’t care either, since they were voted in by people who want to stick it to the cities. It’s an interesting flex though, considering that Houston drives much of the Texas economy and every time we sneeze gas prices go up across the nation. But since the rich can leave whenever they’re inconvenienced and their rural base will still vote for them, why should they care?"
"Houston is just not a pleasant or well-managed place right now. Incompetent leadership and corporate greed, combined with climate change, has turned it into a third world country when storms come."
"It's the same bullshit year after year. 

State/county/city government/local utilities do the bare minimum to prepare; Disaster happens where people have to suffer in boiling heat, floods, or freeze;  Officials go on TV and suck each other's dicks about how hard everybody is working and come up with a catchy slogan; If anybody complains they are shouted down."
"When Texans stop voting Republicans into offices. Hard truth. If you're a conservative voter your values are unironically irrelevant because republican politicians have zero policy positions, they dont actually govern outside of ""muh tax cuts"" and all the other weird shit like getting Commandments and bibles in classrooms."
"I haven’t seen any party with a decent plan to make infrastructure more climate resilient. It doesn’t have to be big and bold. Gimme competence and I’ll vote for it.

Republicans have become a joke."
"I’m only here because of family members I help, if not, I would be gone from this STATE! Almost 30 years, I’m beyond fucking tired and these storms are going to get more frequent and more intense. This city and infrastructure is not even being close to being ready. People can keep moving here in droves, I’m out of here the first chance I can leave, I’m tired. I’ve been saving money up for years to make sure I do it right. "
I understand all the hate Houston gets from other Texas cities. We are so fucking primitive. I'm sick of it.
"The last 4 disasters, maybe more, that I can remember, there were always 1M+ people who didn't have power.  We are batting 1,000 at the moment.  

Comes November, vote all the incumbents out.  Don't care about which political party."
"While our loser corporate monkey governor is in Asia, I love our city, hate our stupid government. Centerpoint is a freaking mafia that just cares about money and theres nothing we can do bc the idiots in small towns only care about ""conservative values"" and keeping Texas red, while Abbott sits on his high horse with his scamming croney bald b\*tch(Ken Paxton). God I hate them all, they dont care about us!!! There are no down power lines but somehow half our complex doesn't have electricity and its damn near impossible to even get an update. I remember growing up and going through worse storms and it never was this big of an issue."
I adore Texas but our power grid is a joke. I’m honestly surprised there aren’t more riots at government offices
The State hates the City of Houston. Just look at the news. It’s as if the State punishes Houston and its citizens actively. I’ve never lived in a city where officials hate their own citizens. Why is it like this!?
"I wonder if voters could make it illegal for power companies to have any charges on the bill other than usage charges.

They might change their mind about grid maintenance and durability if they are making no money when the power is out."
"Welcome to a deregulated energy market. Some regulation is a good thing. Enforcing that gas lines be properly winterized or that transmission towers are structurally sound enough to not be blown over by 50-60MPH winds are smart things that would stop a lot of issues like this. However, they cost money, and given the choice of spending money to cover edge cases or not spending money and YOLO'ing every time something like this happens, companies will choose saving the money every time. They have to be forced to do the right thing, so it's simply the cost of doing business."
When people start voting for it! As long as Republicans have total control of the state nothing is ever going to change… and in reality will probably continue to get worse.
"When dumb fucks stop voting the good ol boys into office, it'll change.


Narrator: ""it won't change"""
People don’t want to admit it but this city is going downhill.
I am super excited to try out my new state insurance with the 2% deductible!!! I am positive my $5K a year homeowners insurance will come through for us and not increase next year! (Sarcasm)
"Big Bad Texas, huh?  Enough with the bravado.  I just got back from Mexico and weathered the CAT2 strength of Beryl and didn’t go more than 3 minutes without power.  This place is acting like it got hit with CAT9 Katrina+.

What an embarrassment of a state.  A Canadien named Ted as our senator.  Third world country infrastructure across the state.  Don’t get me started on this state acting like it’s 1899.  Republican leadership for decades, and this is what we get and deserve.

But by all means, let’s vote for Abbott for 20 more years.  Let’s get Trump back into the White House.  We have to be the dumbest smart people of the face of this Earth—until project 2025 privatizes education and it becomes a privilege to get a 3rd grade education."
If urban Harris county voters outnumbered rural votes along with texas in general voting further to the left we’d see change. However lived here many years my vote just get erased by a brain rotting voter who thinks voting to the left is voting for a communist or voting for the devil. Then the same conservatives who are in the pockets of center point and other energy companies just get voted in. Sad reality of Texas.
"It's coping. I just learned it's all fucking coping. The grind mindset, staying strong, denial. It's been around for a long time because there's no other way to keep going other than to cope. So we developed evolutionary complacency to accept instead of change."
"My area, zero elec, zero internet, and zero FUCKING CELL PHONE SERVICE!! I didn't even know that was a thing. I can't even make 911 calls. It's BULLSHIT how unprepared this city is."
"Almost feels like a 2nd world country with an unstable power grid and infrastructure.

Downtown has electricity underground and they don't go out. Who's in those buildings during hurricanes anyway?

Why is there SO much backlash about building our infrastructure safer underground? You'll hear arguments ""but marshland and it's wet!"" yet other countries with nearly identical geography are doing it just fine."
"We need another Governor, one who will hold ERCOT accountable. Abbott makes too many deals with the devil. He will put businesses ahead of his constituents every. single. time.  He needs to go, period."
"Blame Texas, not the city. Our state government is actively hostile towards progress or any kind."
"same. ive lived here for so long and its only getting worse... im ready to abandon ship. I love Houston i love its diversity and its food and its culture and arts scene, but the infrastructure is literally killing us.. its not just houston though.. its this whole damn state.."
Remember this when it is time to vote
"70+ mph wins are hardly a slight out of wack.  If you had driven around Houston just after, stuff all over the place was knocked over.   Traffic lights were smashed up all over just from getting peppered with debris."
"""Houston Strong"" (Because Texas didn't invest in infrastructure, insurance companies left, and doesn't believe in climate change, so now we're behind and fucked and have this slogan to make ourselves feel less stupid.)"
"My favorite response to all of this is the “Oh this is nothing compared to the last 18 weather events that knocked out the power” like damn, all that time has gone by and no one has come up with a way to keep the power from going out due to someone sneezing too close to a power line?"
"We’re two days away from people losing their minds. Hospitals are maxed out, HFD and HPD are just running in circles at this point. Pretending that this is ‘normal’ is beyond belief…"
Greg Abbott’s Texas…
Honestly we need to start holding center point accountable. It's a private company. Why can't we push them out and have our own govt run agency?  This wasn't even a cat 2 or cat 5 hurricane either. Cat 1 and you down for days?  Common Houston is used to this and the lines should be built to that standard if tech and materials allows. Maybe we need to audit where this 20 dollar fee goes? Lol
"I get downvoted to oblivion every time I say it... But I'm going to keep on saying it.

Houston, fucking SUCKS."
"People keep saying, “ let’s vote these people out” but don’t realize how knee deep red and blue politicians are when it comes to the energy industry. Not only politicians but big developers in the city as well. 

Now I’m not saying blue and red politicians in this city are one in the same but that Houston will never progress as long as the city and state relies so heavily on O&G. 

I advise people to take a toxic tour of the city so you can understand how this industry impacts Houston on every level. 

If you want to vote for change vote with your feet and move."
Dunno why you think a category one is nothing. It will still fuck shit up as we’ve seen many times in the past.
"I grew up in SETX and spent 15 years in Houston. I left. I am happy. No more year round insane heat. No more roaches or mosquitos. Less traffic. Most importantly, no flooding. Houston, I love you; you're a special place but people are not meant to live in you."
"I say this as a native Houstonian, but OH THE IRONY, of a city that is built on the back of the fossil fuel economy getting nailed by climate change. As for the ""we voted for this"" comment, yeah, some did, some didn't. I used to think TX had a voter participation problem and then was schooled when someone said, ""TX has a voter suppression problem."" Yes to all this. It's hard to overcome gerrymandering and terrible legislation when the state continues to gerrymander and suppress votes. Hard, but not impossible. Lookin at you, Georgia!"

"Keep voting in the same assholes, keep getting the same results.  Texans never learn."
Going to invest in the whole house solar/generator..
"Houston will always be ""home"", but I'm starting to get really sick and tired of living here."
"Lived here for decades, and I know ppl are mocking, but it’s true a category one hurricane was not a big scare typically. We’ve never ever evacuated for a hurricane except during Rita when we already had a road trip to see my sibling planned - I don’t really count that.

Now I’m scared and I’m just so tired. Aren’t we all just exhausted? It’s not dramatic to say this is exhausting and is getting worse.

I’ve driven out of disaster flash flood situations and stayed home for much stronger hurricanes over the years. 

The fact that it’s unbearably hot and power seems even less reliable or as quick to fix in the past is unsettling.

I’m tired

I’d love to move."
Friend works for Reliant and he told me to expect 4-5 days. Energy capital of the US and low grade storms and hurricanes take us off the grid. Ridiculous. Everyone who works for ERCOT should be replaced
"capitalism and greedy politicians. its not a sustainable system. the economy is garbage, most people i know are working two jobs and still barely scraping by (myself included). i literally cant afford to miss days of work or have my entire fridge/freezer full of food spoil due to this bullshit"
And how are we the “energy capital of the world…” nvm
Can you imagine how fucked we would be if this was a category 3 or 4? Or God forbid a 5!
A cat 1 hurricane causing 2 million people to lose power is highly concerning
Never forget. Texas has some of the worst voter turnout in America. Typically less just over half the population (51% - 55%) decides how the state behaves. Being in the most populace county means our votes count for a lot. It’s not an immediate fix but voting is the way to secure the future.
"> I love this city

*Why?*"
Vote blue for stronger regulation
"This is so legit, this is the third time after Harvey and the blizzard and still they are not prepared… its a freaking joke."
"Vote for people who will help you, not just people who hate the same as you"
"Just watched Ted Cruz give the usual bullshit speech of “resilience” “ it’s not about race, red or blue it’s about Texans coming together blah blah” “ I’m just as impacted by the storm as you guys.” 

Smh right on cue, can’t wait to see the news coverage of Mattress Mack, Trae the Truth and Joel Osteen giving aid to Houstonians showing how Houston strong we are! Smh lmaoooo"
"No state tax  and  incompetent corrupt government consistently being voted in. 


Not a surprise."
"It made sense in 2018. After all these events, I’m not feeling it anymore."
How did they admit to not prepare repair crews? They had 6000 people from out of the city ready as soon as the storm moved through they started working. It was all over the news.
"Stop voting in republicans. Full fkn stop. I’m not saying Dems are the fix, because Dems are mostly feckless, but begin by voting someone in who will not allow this shit to happen. 

Rule of law is the only thing short of guillotines that’s going to fix/end this shit. "
">How many deaths is it going to take before someone makes a change?  

You'll need to vote out the Republicans  in the state government if you want any change."
$CNP should fire their executive teams that are failing to make reasonable reinvestment and weatherization preparations. (Since they've legislated a bunch of states to remove the word climate change/global warming you have to call it weatherization.)
"Agreed, I am sitting at HEB because it's the only place with power and cell service.  I am done with this fucking bullshit.  I only wish I didn't have so many roots set here.  As a lifelong, born and raised resident all I have to say is fuck this place."
"It’s not a red/blue issue. Money will find its way in every politics. As Texans we are getting too attached to ideology. Ideology will not address these real issues. Whoever is not doing their work, needs to go. Big corporations and donors get cozy with whoever is in power and protects the incumbency. Stop voting along ideological lines only. Basic infrastructure is so basic and we can’t get it right!???"
Greg Abbott's in South Korea Lina Hildago left. Only reason Ted Cruz didn't go to Cancun is they're all so probably dealing with some of the after effects of the hurricane.
"Where is Ted Cruz??
Last time that moron ran away to Cancun"
Welcome to Houston.
I’m glad I left. I love Houston so much but it’s a disaster.
"If we didn't strengthen our infrastructure after Ike, we certainly aren't going to now."
"Hubs had to go to work today because they had power, but HR left out the part where the AC wasn’t working. Bastards!"
This hurricane has shown that Houston is becoming unsustainable.
Shit city
"I’m not a native Texan. I’ve a SoCal native who has been in Texas since 2004. For the facts that my home state is constantly on fire and yes, I did live through the worst earthquakes that Califoria had in modern history (looking at you Northridge Earthquake), this living in Houston thing with the hurricanes is insane. 

I’ve been through Harvey and now this. Our state should stop prioritizing profits and join either the East or West power grids. This is insane. It’s 48 hours without power so far in a heat wave for a Category 1!! And we’re lucky to have a small generator to power small appliances like the fridge, box fans, and chargers. My husband has a good job, I have good doctors, and we have family here so I think we’re stuck here (as much as I want to move home to SoCal). I want to move to a new house and while I know they’re expensive, I want a whole home generator. My health quite literally can’t handle this heat so it’s kind of a necessity if the dang state isn’t going to take care of us and make sure we don’t roast in our houses like Thanksgiving turkeys!"
"Center point is going to benefit from insurance claims for their damages to lines therefore they should not bill all their customers for at least 1week of outages!!

Our stupid Ted Cruz should help us out
We all need to call his office"
I’m literally wearing an old #houstonstrong tshirt reading this. I picked it out in the dark of my closet without knowing what I was putting on.
Just look in the mirror and say Centerpoint three times and your power should come back
"It’s because people from other states control our energy grids, when to turn on and off. Gotta love ERCOT, they f*cked us during the freeze and still continue too. I bet Whitman and Lena Hidalgo all have power though."
"Last winter, I read somewhere (forget which major credible news source) that although the state govt had mandated winterization of the power grid (incidentally, winterization was actually required after major outages in 2011), there were a lot, lot, lot of loopholes for the energy companies to not do the winterization. And don't forget that the ERCOT board members took off and evaded fines and culpability? after the winter storm Uri in 2021 where 246 people died officially related to the statewide outages. Here in Houston, some people were without heat for how long? Up to 2 weeks? And then people got slapped with $9,000/MWh bills."
"One of my brothers has lived in several cities across the US and the world. I was talking about the derecho with him and all the lost power around town, and he says, “you know that’s not normal, right? Other parts of the country don’t lose power -and STAY without power- like Houston does. That city is fucked up.” 

Not normal indeed. F+ck centerpoint."
"I’m just glad CRT has been banned and that we have the 10 commandments in school. That’s focusing on priorities. 

/s"
"It's going to stay that way until Texas shifts politically. The conservatives have been in control of Texas for 3 decades. 1) The pushed us to privatize our energy and 2) they segregated our grid from everyone else. 3) They created ERCOT and put their pals in charge of it. and 4)  have refused to force them to strengthen our power infrastructure. 

  
But the people of Texas will keep complaining that our state is going to hell and keep hiring the same assholes responsible for it...

Tell your neighbors.. ""Look, I get it. Fox has you convinced the left is nothing but pedis reading gay books to your kids in dresses... but please.. if you think there are ANY problems with the way Texas is run... just for 2 election cycles, try voting for a democrat, and see how it goes. If its no better or worse, then go ahead and vote for the GOP again... 

  
Seriously. .I think the Dems could get some traction in Texas is they would run that message... ""just let us try for a few years"""
Real question: why is the energy supply in the hands of one single company? What history or politics led to this situation? Seems having more companies would be the answer.
Definitely in the top five reasons why we left Houston a few years ago. 
"My parents (who live down there) were up here in DFW for the 4th. I offered them another week as it became obvious from channel 39’s hip hop weather report on TikTok that y’all’d be getting a hurricane. 

They went home as planned anyway. They’re already regretting that choice."
I work out of town and before I make plans to come home for a weekend I need to CHECK IF I HAVE ELECTRICITY. Beryl is not the first time. This is not a problem I've encountered in any other city.
"I hope people will remember these moments, use these moments, and continue to try to bring about change through our election process."
IF only there was a national power grid that texas could connect to?
"I did my part. Removed large trees the previous owner planted right under power lines, bought a generator, a small window unit, and made sure the next house I bought had a gas stove and fireplace."
Its probably because the people running the grid have been the same for decades and their goal is making their friends money and not having a functional power grid
"We have to vote for politicians who want to spend money on infrastructure. 

The ones we have now like to blame our crumbling power grid on the federal government and their political rivals, but don't try to address it themselves."
Vote democrat or leave the state. Republicans can not run a functional government. There are essential zero Republican ran states that are not in the red when it comes to governance. Their policies don’t work.
This post is completely on point. 👍
"The state voted for this. 

I would move."
"There's no going back, man. Everyone said that. Everyone knew that. This isn't an ""oops let's walk it back a little now that we've learned our lesson"" situation. It's done. Houston will be unlivable arid dead land in 20 years."
We all need to evacuate this hellscape!
"Vote out Abbot and the GOP, they're the ones keeping us off the grid"
"Texas is a good example of how conservative politics are not intended to actually work. They are only meant to make some kind of point, whether or not it's actually a good point. They are willing to stand by their terrible policies to the death."
"My wife and I just had a conversation this morning. For the second time this year we’ve had to evacuate with power outages and damage to the house. And we lose power during completely normal storms as well. 

Result of conversation is that we are leaving Houston within the next year. Have been here for 10 years and liked it, but I truly believe these disasters are going to become even more common with climate change. My job is remote now and without family tying you to this city there’s just not a big enough draw now. Sucks but it’s just not feasible or safe to remain here any longer."
That decision to start vacation at Vegas looking smarter by the day……
"I definitely get wanting to leave Houston, but not for Alabama"
The sun burns all 🌞 🔥 💰 🔥 🌞
Native Houstonian considering getting the hell outta dodge. I’ve fallen out of love with this place.
"We just moved here in September. We’ve absolutely loved the diversity, beautiful outdoor spaces, and amazing people we’ve met here, but damn if we’re not already making plans to move.
As a Floridian, Texas has not excuse for poor infrastructure, especially with all the money that’s moved into the state in the past few years."
I blame Ercot and the State of Tx. There's only so much a city can do against laxed regulations like that.
After 35 years we moved. Still have our Houston house…glad it survived one last hurricane but it’s about to be someone else’s money pit 🫡
Best option is...move away
The education system down here appears fairly inadequate and half the population is confused about how the civil war ended. Why do you expect that population demographic to select effective leaders? These are the same people that have to be reminded not to drive **into** a flooded road.
"The leadership remains the same. No political action has been taken against the people responsible for the failure of the power grid. The huge influx of federal dollars from the Dems was not used to fix the grid. We are in this mess because our neighbors believe all funding should be going to ""secure our border."" Our neighbors believe that successful previous climate action is actually a failure because the world hasn't ended yet. We are fucked. A nation truly in decline. The empire killer, Afghanistan with the help of COVID, has ended the American dream. We are toast. Burnt toast."
But somehow you keep electing the same douch bag republicans and expecting different results!
Amazing how this turned into politics republican vs democrat post.
"I’m with you on that. I for the life of me can’t understand why so many were out of power and CP was not even ready to roll out a resiliency plan for a Cat 1. You would think they would have a plan for cat 5 no matter which type of hurricane  we get hit with. But instead they snapped back at us on their website. 

I hope someone is filing a civil and or federal lawsuit because I will join them. I’m sure plenty from my community are just as pissed and will gladly join."
Those times have passed. Nothing will change.
GOD you’re tellin me😢
I've used mine up earlier this yr for surgery 😩 I picked the wrong time of year to have it done
"Democrat John F. Kennedy:"" Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country"""
Lol
Then don’t
You dont have electricity and its hot. I wonder if its hot for the guys outside working to fix it. 
😂 😂 😂
Houston strong bitch
Houston is a corrupt cesspool of selfish politicians feeding off of the citizens. They steal cheat and lie constantly. They give contracts to whoever gives them a kickback. They have zero thoughts or cares about the people that live here. This has gone on for decades. It will continue as long as the people continue to allow them to do it.
Houston is literally a 3rd world city
"33. Been here my whole life. As an independent adult and home owner for 3 years now on my own.... First time in my life I've ever considered moving away from the coast. I don't think I can do this every year. With a few more incidents sprinkled in, such as the freeze. I'm not sure I'm built for this life anymore lol"
I broke down at work today. I have a powering pole sitting OUT OF THE GROWN and hanging by the electrical wires over mine and my neighbors house. Now we have three more days of rain. I can’t take much
"Centerpoint stock is up, so investors are happy. Customers can’t leave, so they should save money. 

This is what Texans constantly vote for."
Stop voting red
"I'm from out here and this is normal, in fact is normal throughout anywhere by the gulf coast and specifically the gulf coast. Hurricane Katrina 2005 RIP to all fallen and lost family members to this day should have been ya warning right then and there. 

All these people moving to the bayou city with thier coins and cranking up businesses are completely unaware of what really happens out here is beyond me. Everyone from here knows lights could take up to an week or more. This is the lonely star state there's a bunch of rural areas within 80-100 miles that's been without lights and thats what most out of Towners call the ""country side"" already has thier gas, generators, vegetables and everything in order. 

But I'm glad this is happening so it'll weed out the ones that's not from here complaining because houston is not like NY on the east side or Los Angeles -- these contractors and sub contractors are going to take thier sweet time and get paid.

Yall forgetting there's only CENTERPOINT and ENTERGY out here the only 2 main providers out here.

Welcome to the lone star state."
"I've lived here my entire life and love Texas and where I live but more people lost power in Beryl, a category one hurricane than hurricane Ike which was a category 2 upon landfall in Galveston. Ever since that major freeze and snow the entire power grid has been running off of hot dog water. I wish everyone would band together and force this shit to change but everyone's focused on stupid shit"
"Y’all be sure to research whole house generators look into the battery ones. Saw 10-12 posts those w the natural gas ones some having problems w lines and/or finding the fuel they need. Having a $10-20k Generator and can’t even use it due to fuel issues. That’s one thing that might make me put a Flippen For Sale Sign in my yard and pack up and get the helllooo outta dodge for a long long while. Everyone be safe and please try stay as cool all of you and your pets too as you can w mini showers, cold packs, as much water as possible. 

Upstate NY I heard is going through similar as us too right now and a few other places across the country. Electric came on for 5 mins and went back out again. I knew it would and may for a day or two after it’s back on. Talk about everyone in this family having a f ing meltdown when it went out again. Saw my spouse headed to the patio w a Small cooler of beer muttering about F inggggg Houston! Guessing he’s had enough too! They have a day off after working 7 days straight/12-16 hours. 

He’s not laughing about the kiddie Pools or the low beach seats I bought end last year. I’ve been filling them w Ice Bags and water and him sitting in them when he gets home from working out in heat all day. Whatever freaking works. Be safe keeping ya all in prayers and we’re still all Texas and Houston Strong! 

Still feeling like this is all one big freaking distraction from what state and higher gov don’t want us paying attention to whatever they are trying to screw up or screw us out of next."
"Oh no that Texas strong shit done fed to the birds and they died too. New saying is “Texas Weak” asss power grids. 

THERE IS NO PROACTIVE ONLY REACTIVE. 

100 yr old lady dies from heat and awwwwwww let’s write about it when we we’ve have had over 1000 years to fix this even after the sea wall was built. 22 people died from beryl so far and majority due to heat and POWER GRIDS. Shit never gonna change."
"When you vote and vote D at all levels. If more people  in Houston (and other cities) voted in Democrats, we’d have infrastructure that we need. Republicans give money to corporations with only a pretense of regulation.

I too love this city but am considering moving, but I want to vote for Colin Allred and others before i leave. besides, it’s easier to move when it isn’t boiling hot."
"Have you considered that maybe your states corrupt leadership who continuously have spouted bullshit about how their energy grid model is the best, while consistently having the worse grid outages of any state for decades and still getting re-elected is wild."
You know what would be a good motivator? If everyone went on strike and didn't pay the power bill. If a million people didn't pay their bill for a month they would definitely listen. Especially if it was an organized endeavor.
"Keep voting in Republicans, dummies"
Get solar and battery and an electric car for good measure. Has served me well in two freezes a derecho and now Beryl

Im sure they will just blame woke power or something just like the freeze.

im amazed how they lose power 1-2x a week at each location

we dont have these issues in our locations in ""3rd world"" countries.

seems like you guys are living in like north korea lol"
Blame the politicians. They pulled out of the national grid so they could manage it themselves. They wanted to do it cheaper and they fucking did. They fucked us.
"The biggest problem is centerpoint refusing to be proactive - my neighbors behind me have trees growing into the power lines running through the backyards. 
I send photos with address to centerpoint monthly and get no response. 
They do not clear the shit thst needs to be cleared during non-emergencies and then lay the blame on homeowners for having trees and shit in the lines. 

Regular tree trimming crews won't touch a tree growing into the power lines, they say you need to contact centerpoint and centerpoint refuses to act. 

So we will continue to have these issues until someone is put in charge over there that forces them to do line cleanup and maintenance outside of storm repairs."
Centerpoint is a fucking joke. Shouldn’t be surprised that nothing is ever done about it
Had to go all the way to Austin to get a generator just to power my fridges and a small ac unit I hate shitterpoint energy
i literally love houston and this constantly happening with no change is making me not want to be here anymore… and i planned to be here for like ever. it was only a category one.. like are they purposely doing this?!?! make it make sense.
I fucking love Houston so much but I am finally ready to start looking at living somewhere else. This is literally unsustainable.
"I hear you. I used to love this city, hate it now… dreaming about the day I have the ability to move."
🤣
"Why would they? Genuinely, why? They have your money and the ability to operate with impunity within the state of Texas so why would they give a flying fuck about you or anyone else? You’re nothing more than a guaranteed dollar sign to them."
Maybe start voting democrat and elect folks that actually care about people over profits.
Texas sucks outside the food.
"Oh man, when I think of Houston I think: ""Nah, I'm good."" Enjoy your big houses that go under water ever 10 years or so."
"Keep voting Republican at the state level,  it will never be fixed because they are bought and paid for."
"If you vote GOP, you can't be bitching about losing electricity every time the weather is out of wack."
Abbott and the other Horsemen of the Texas Apocalypse never pay a political price for their indifference to human suffering. So why should they care?
My grandmas house gets buried in 10 feet of snow and her power is still on but we get a small gust of wind and a rain drop and we’re lights out for a week and everyone is driving like a fucking moron
"Yeah, because the democrat politicians are going to miraculously convert our above-ground power lines below-ground. Great discussion as always r/houston"
"The other side of the coin is that Democrats get into power and concentrate more on social issues that affect a small minority rather than what use to be their meat and potatoes. 

I’m left of center due to my economics and I want a Democrat that will come in and focus on jobs, raising the minimum wage, unions, and infrastructure. “It’s the economy stupid”. It’s a damn shame that Democrats managed to lose a portion of the union vote. Those use to be automatic votes."
Occupy Center Point
Houston strong is bullshit. It's an attaboy for not rioting. When they let us down. Now watch how centerpoint passes these repairs on to its customers. It's always more of the same. Houston is still going to continue to flood the second it rains and power outages will continue to happen the second the wind blows a little too hard. Heads need to roll behind this.
"Love that the outage map was down for retooling and supposedly was going to be up before the end of July.

Probably should have hit that a little harder Centerpoint. 

On another rant Whitmire inserted his own Centerpoint employee to the Chairwoman position of Metro so now every time there’s a weather event I have to worry about being able to get to work as well. (Eye problems) so I’m using PTO because we had to bail for northern counties."
"H-Tiiine Hol’it diiine 🤘🏻


But no for shit getting annoying"
Just go to Cancun?
Let’s send another trillion dollars to the Ukraine instead of fixing our problems.  Splendid idea!

I've never been Houston Strong. Houston is not strong on what I think is important.
"And yet Texans still vote for people like Cruz, Paxton and Abbot."
"To answer every one of your questions: Never. It's never going to get better because politicians and people responsible making sure everything runs efficiently don't care. They absolutely give ZERO f's about every person in the dark right now. Except for themselves, of course, but they have backup generators, so they'll need to sleep with blankets tonight. Their room will be too cold to sleep without a warm, cozy blanket to snuggle up with."
Vote 👍
"They're called ""once in a lifetime"" or ""hundred-year"" storms because they're getting worse. Climate change is real. They sold it to us and we bought it, one ""Better Life"" step at a time...
Category 1 is evidently too much for you. 
Hurricanes will always be, whatever category. 
Be thankful it wasn't the Cat 5 Beryl that trashed the Caribbean.
You do realize that nobody here can help you, yes? 
We are all beholden to the rich old white dudes that buy our politicians. You and me? We're just $$-makers for them..."
Vote
"currently planning to leave, like a lot of other commenters here. I’m just afraid of the shock we’ll face in an area that has a higher COL, but at this point with the way costs are rising here, it won’t be that jarring. I hate every single morning that I wake up in this city, largely because of how fucking miserable the weather is."
"I’m just glad CRT has been banned and that we have the 10 commandments in school. That’s focusing on priorities. 

/s"
"I think it goes way beyond Houston as a city. This is what happens when colonialism and corporate interests completely gut the land and make it something it is not. This was always a swamp but then you bring in human hubris of the powerful - here we are. All of these powerhouses are what made Houston a heavily polluted area with no zoning and chemical plants everywhere. Then you touch up on the politics of the place which are also led by corporate interests in BOTH parties - then where is there going to be substantial change? Not to mention, due to Houston being incredibly blue we are constantly being messed with by our very spiteful state government....

Community is what makes Houston great but unfortunately the community is not being nurtured and is in fact being burned out by all of the bullshit. Without a major disruption to the hustle lifestyle here, are we truly unified outside of that? The heat has always been a persistent issue which was getting worse if you paid attention to what is happening to our homeless population, now it's catching up to the working class, middle class, and higher until it's pretty much the end.

So IDK, the onus kinda falls on us too to organize better, get on the same page, and demand in mass what needs to happen....in-person preferably."
houston struggling
"I think of it as a mini vacation. Get time off work, have a big cookout with all the food from fridge/freezer, listen to music until the battery dies and crack open a bottle of vodka. 

There are people in the Caribbean with real problems."
"Maybe you aren't Houston strong? 

I was born and raised in Houston. When we lost power we figured out a way to manage. Heat isn't an issue. It's Houston. Comes as a given. Losing power seems to be a huge gripe here, where is your generator? Don't have one? That's on You. If you failed to mitigate issues that affect you, that's Your fault. It's not a corporations fault that a tree comes down and takes out power. That's just part of life in a first world.

When I lived in the Virgin Islands we were paying nearly 0.50 a kwh for electricity and they had rolling brownouts all the time. No electricity = no water since water came from cistern via pump. That's less than ideal."
"This is really only a problem in the lower socioeconomic areas.


Haven't you noticed how higher median income areas don't suffer. it's messed up. 

Sincerely a person with power - also the energy grid here sucks. Wtb a better power company PGE IS LEGIT"
"I laughed out loud at “How many deaths is it going to take” 

Reddit is so fucking over dramatic."
Vote! Get better smarter people in charge.
“Thanks Biden”

"The reason why the grid is so waked , simply because of the over growth of population. They can’t keep up with all the people moving here . Doesn’t matter what they do ! And can’t complain when power lines are lying on the street. Linemen are working their ass’s off to get it back up an running. It’s hilarious to me how people can’t go one day without power without whining about being hot and pissed about Houston. I’m more pissed about everyone moving here and causing all the problems. It wasn’t like this 10yrs ago."
Good god people are spoiled.
Then gtfo wtf
"Well, it’s a democrat run city. People keep voting these idiots in. The change you want needs to come from the person in the mirror."
Tired of being Houston strong all the time? Lol its only a couple of days of the year. People exaggerate too much.
No city in the country would’ve been able to take this storm without power outages.
"Maybe prepare better next time like an adult? Ya know, with a generator? Maybe some gas? A power bank? This is Houston and we get bad storms. And we live in a giant swamp. The Governor, the Mayor, the police will not save you. Places with better climates cost more and understandably so."
