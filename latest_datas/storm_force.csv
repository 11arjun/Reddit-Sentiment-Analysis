Work is gonna wait till we’re all at the office to call off
cant wait to still have to go to work monday
I’m so not in the mood for this fucking bullshit.
I got a flight Monday. I need my flight to get canceled.
Say the line Katy
Should we be concerned about the Livingston dam situation? It'll probably be ok.
"I live a ways west of Houston, it’s going to come pretty much straight over my house."
My bet is the track is going to keep creeping east until it's over Houston.  I mean why should it stop creeping now?
Anyone know of an app or website where I can see what small streets are flooded in the inner loop? Im aware of TxDOT but they usually only report major roads like interstates and US highways. Im trying to prepare for Monday since I have to travel
"\> SCW has an app

Bro didn’t we have 100 mph winds like two months ago
How do you think Galveston will fare? Looks to be slightly outside the path but I'd imagine itll still get drenched.
im really worried about the rain. i hope there are moments of reprieve when the rain hits so that drainage systems can get enough time to drain a bit before another deluge comes. at least the storm is moving fast and not hovering over the city from what the weather says.
