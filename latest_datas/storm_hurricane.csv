a bit more time for it to show us its cards
new nhc update just dropped. This one getting too close for comfort
"> Some stronger than others but the likelihood of a strong storm across a portion of Houston is increasing.

Oh good, I was tired of this two week streak of stable electricity!

Guess I'm off to Total Wine now..."
"Unfortunately it will be tomorrow night before we have a much better idea of what will happen. I refreshed my hurricane kit today. I ate some of the tastier parts of it during the big storm a few weeks ago.

My hope is many of the dead trees and loser limbs came down during the storm earlier this year and we will have less damage than normal for a high wind event."
"Yes, the afternoon forecast has indicated that we should have concerns for early next week. For those who do not or cannot prep for hurricane season, now is the time to buy a bit extra if you can. PLEASE do not panic-buy and leave store shelves empty for the next person who comes along. Stay calm and go to several different stores if you have a large family and need to stock up. Panic is contagious.

Bear in mind that at this point it's still not looking like a crisis for the Houston area. The likelihood is that this will just be a wakeup call for people who don't already have plans. Eye on the Storm [https://yaleclimateconnections.org/topic/eye-on-the-storm/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/topic/eye-on-the-storm/)  has a good explanation for why this probably won't be another Harvey event. But if you really hate driving in the rain and there's an important errand you can take care of tomorrow or the next day, you should do it asap for your own peace of mind.

Eye on the Storm also has concerns for the Lake Livingston Dam. This should not be taken lightly, but shouldn't be cause for immediate panic, either. Quietly buy extra water if you can, though. In a day or two, if it looks like heavy rains could affect that particular area, wash all your clothes and take a shower. Buy baby wipes for waterless showers, too. That dam supplies water to much of Houston.

Editing to add that you can still order water on Amazon and have it delivered by Sunday if you have concerns about the Lake Livingston Dam situation."
Do y'all think it's mostly going to be business as usual in Houston on Monday? I have an appointment  to get my yearly physical for work and no one seems to be talking about closures.
"It seems to me like storms along the western gulf  have a tendency to go north east of where they’re predicting, we saw this with Rita, Ike to an extent, most of the storms that have hit Louisiana over the past decade. 

So I always try to keep my senses alert when a storm is predicted to hit to our south and west, because as we’ve seen so many times just a little tilt in the track can really impact where landfall happens. 

Idk I’m too busy to deal with a hurricane right now, but I’m right along clear lake so I’m paying close attention. 

Really annoyed it’s not a straightforward forecast, but nature rarely is straightforward, especially these days."
"Had a flight booked out of Houston for Tuesday and just rebooked it for super early Monday morning. Even if we don’t get hurricane force winds or damages here, the odds keep climbing for tropical storm conditions."
Not if it's just going to deteriorate in the comments like the banter in this thread.
I think katy Already evacuated.
Any input if flights will depart on Wednesday from IAH?
How about now?
And the models haven’t accounted for northward short-term changes in track that would bring it towards Houston. Not looking good.
"It'll be a tropical storm or a cat 1 likely when it hits us (which is worse case scenario ). I'm ready for the rain. There is also no big time high pressure system sitting near us (like with Harvey), so it'll be moving on. It's actually being predicted to be pulled quite hard N/NE.

We need the rain, and so does central Texas, desperately.


Still showing southwest of matagorda bay.

"Odds are it just causes some widespread rain, lots of widespread rain, but NWS forecasts are like 8 inches at most near landfall, so barring some high pressure system that doesn't currently exists bouncing it off the coast, given how dry it is and the runoff we'll get because of that we're probably just gonna have some not quite but nearing full-ish bayous and thats about it."
Hurricane Watch issued Sargent to mouth of rio grande
"Been watching this storm for days and it was always slowly moving north. Comments on the news fb page show others seeing the same but this morning was the first time the major news networks said it shifted north. If you look at all the other major hurricanes they do the same thing. There is definitely trends happening and if I remember correctly when Harvey hit, the eye hit Rockport and was considering a tropical storm when it made landfall."
"Since we are all here, where could I evacuate with my cat in a carrier going west, north, or east? Any suggestions on what to do with kitty when I get there? Its my first time planning to evacuate."
If if hits it’ll be this weekend correct?
Hope everyone's insurance is up-to-date. No changes now that there is a watch up.
"If you don't got a generator, buy one now. If you can't afford it immediately use Affirm and pay it off later.

Idk why yall are down voting me, being without power is common and being prepared for a coming storm, like buying a generator is just good sense."
"Half the homes in Calhoun County are owned by Houstonians, but god forbid any of us pay any attention to the weather past 99, lest we're ""afraid"""
"Source?

I don't see the eye anywhere close to Galveston.

Currently it’s TS Beryl.
