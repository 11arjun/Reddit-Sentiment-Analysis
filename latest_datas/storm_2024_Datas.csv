Can’t you dispute a misclassification? They have to prove you were not an employee and can get in a lot of trouble.
Lina Hidalgo mentioned a short term $750 assistance that you could apply for through the Greater Houston Disaster Alliance. There’s a link in [this](https://abc13.com/post/how-get-help-after-beryl-hurricane-recovery-fund/15061823/) article. Supposedly as fast as 48 hours.
"You should apply for FEMA.GOV assistance right away. Do it online. They will help with the $750

Then I’d look to see what side hustle you can get into. Do you have a vehicle? Door dash, Uber, etc for quick cash till things stabilize"
"Lots of food distribution sites available this week. Check websites at Houston Food Bank, Baker Ripley, local precincts, churches etc.

Good luck!"
And I hate hate hate typing this but if you are in a bind financially it’s kind of a last resort option: consider plasma donation which can pay a few hundred dollars.

Look for clean up jobs!!!
"Real talk? I’ve been without anything before and lived in a tent in a state park for a year with raccoons as neighbors. Take what work you can get and volunteer when you can’t. I got more help volunteering than anywhere and I didn’t feel like I was taking handouts. Don’t leave any gaps on your employment record and volunteerism looks great.

Find out where needs are and seek to fill them. Who knows, it might turn into self employment 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Call the Catholic Church nearest you and speak to their St Vincent de Paul society. You don’t have to be Catholic to get help from them. It might be worth an ask.
"How long had you worked there? If you were there in 2023, did you get a W-2 or 1099?"
"Heres a list of resources from BakerRipley hopefully it helps:

"Get in touch with Oncall services, it's a temp agency that can help you find a job quick.  May not be the ideal job but it will get you back on the right track!"
"Alief isd is hiring, get in today for the beginning of the school year."
"Reach out to Cypress Assistance Ministries in Cypress.  They will help people in need, based on their needs, and have a great food bank.

Definitely put in an application for fema stat if you haven’t already. I just got approved today.
Not sure if it helps but Shell FCU is offering a disaster relief loan up to 15k. You’ll have to provide any photos and receipts of anything you may have had to spend money on.
"Apply for disaster relief. Make sure to note everything that you needed to pay for due to the hurricane. I was initially denied but as of yesterday was approved for $750.

There’s a way to appeal for up to $42k if needed according to the letter I received.

You can still get unemployment they’re doing disaster benefits now
FEMA is hiring … get paid to help out!
I took out a loan from my bank to keep me from going under.
You are not alone.  Exact same scenario for my family
Tacos Dona Lena on Hammerly is hiring and in desperate need of staff. Can't guarantee how much you'll make but something is better than nothing.
"There is so much work out there right now with the storm. Yard cleanup, fence work, tree cutting, basic roof repairs, etc. If I wasn’t so busy with work I would start doing that on the side.  You gotta find ways to make that bread. It ain’t gonna come to you."
Disasterassistance.gov is a great resource. Texas has also opened Disaster Unemployment so you may qualify now. I would reach out to Texas workforce for more information.
Try SER jobs and see if they can help you with an employment opportunities. YMCA is also hiring at the moment
"I was misclassified and reported to the TWC and the IRS. Both found my claim to be true. However, I didn't get a dime from that employer. It did shift business practices in that niche industry (yoga studios). Good luck to you!"
"Just a silent observer here— but you all that take the time and effort to respond to someone in need like this is truly impressive. As a member of the houston community and fellow human, I praise you all for helping OP and anyone else who may benefit.  Kudos to you all "
"I'm willing to bet that ""incorrect classification"" was by intent."
Call 311
"I know this isn't of great help but fema is giving critical needs funding if you went without power had to use gas during outage of 750 instant approval .. just fill out application online they will direct deposit within 48 to 72 hrs.. make sure you check the box that says you need help with gas ,diapers critical needs box on application

Try this. Grants mostly for folks in your situation."
Honestly you should look into plassing. Helped me when i quit my fancy job.
"Apply for Amazon wearhouse, Krogers warehouse in person and HEB wearhouse. You will have a job by the end of next week more than likely."
"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALawyer/s/E6VBA49JSz 

You said here you were a contractor so I’m confused ?"
You didn’t notice you didn’t have payroll taxes taken out of your check?
i swear so many places do that independent contractor BS. had to put my foot down this year to get a proper W2
"wait. a contractor can't get unemployment checks? that doesn't sound correct. when i was laid off years ago as a contractor, i was able to get unemployment checks. has the law changed?"
I would suggest checking on your status by reviewing [TWC Independent Test](https://efte.twc.texas.gov/appx_e_twc_ic_test.html). File unemployment benefits if you’re not independent per TX laws.
"If you have a car payment, most will defer your monthly payment & just add another month to your term"
"I am struggling myself and I just made a Gofund me out of desperation. I made $1,000 in one day."
What line of work are you in?
Why can’t you collect unemployment as an independent contractor? 1099/gig workers were getting unemployment during the pandemic.
An employment attorney can file a lawsuit and would absolutely do it on contingency if you have a legit claim.

"Fema will give a quick 750. Apply online. If you need a computer go to a library or call.

St. Vincent de Paul society will provide some help as well. [https://www.archgh.org/resources/need-help/](https://www.archgh.org/resources/need-help/)

Fight the reclassification, make a complaint about it."

"FEMA disaster assistance, Harris County Assistance, TWC file on old employee, Snap, Apply for Texas lone star card, then go to any one open as there are signs for help on almost every business around houston just to start getting some income and move up from there. You got this, just stay positive!"
">I lost my job right before the storm, and I haven’t been able to collect unemployment because my job misclassified me as an independent contractor rather than an employee.

Getting this fixed should be priority number one, have you filed a complaint with the labor board?

FEMA unemployment
"If you used to get SNAP benefits and have a card, you can get food lost benefits and may need to apply with a new application to get more food stamps on top of that it's called expedited stamps. 

If you have a vehicle start earning money by working with Instacart or Favor. 

If you want an immediate job, apply with 5 Star Staffing working as a security guard at the major events (sport games and events).

"I have much empathy and I am right there with you about a strain on finances !

Unemployment you need to do an appeal on that and let say you win they will back pay you from when you originally filed. Do you have your offer letter from when you were hired that is the first piece of strong evidence you are not a contractor.

Next FEMA is covering food loss their website is off and on and been crashing (many people applying in a major city) but I was approved for 750.00 so that will help you. I have not gotten the money in my bank yet but it is coming soon I am assuming they did not tell me a time frame but looking around online ppl say 7-10 business days"
I'll DM you about something that you can use to take the edge of while you're stressed.
"Same here brother. 

Lost my Outside sales job in late June, and TWC never answer my calls or get back to me to get unemployment. 

It’s been a very stressing time… Got loan payments taken out of my bank account causing negative balance… yeah it’s hell. 

I’m looking through the comments just like you. Thank you for posting this god bless you."
