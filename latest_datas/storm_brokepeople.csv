"I may be Houston strong. But, I‚Äôm Houston angry also."
"No, the storm didn't break us. It's never \*just\* the storms.  

The infrastructure failed us. Our leaders failed us. Corporations putting profits over people failed us. This state's government continues to fail us and harm us. 

I will never judge anyone for leaving when it has become increasingly detrimental to every aspect of our quality of life to continue to stay here. If you can leave, godspeed, I hope you find a place that actually wants you to thrive there."
"It did something to me. 8 days without power is a serious low. I even live in a pricey neighborhood in Rice Village. Politics are so divisive, people can't even agree that the TX power grid needs regulation to prevent a Cat 1 storm from knocking the 4th largest city in the US out for over 1 week.

There was a time in day 3 where I watched a tree leaning on a power line catch on fire. CNP never came out and HFD couldnt do anything unless the fire spread to my house. CNP is so bad. Just god awful."
I'm Houston Getting Da Fuq Outta Here.
Storms in Houston are more frequent and more severe. It‚Äôs only going to get worse.
"I started planning my exit a year ago, seeking a new adventure and a change of scenery. Being without power for 4-days post Derecho and 6 post-Beryl have solidified my desire to try something new. I‚Äôm leaving at the end of the month.  

I grew up in Alief in the 80s-90s, an upbringing that taught me so much about cultural and economic diversity. I have lived all over town. There are so many things and people that make Houston special. Not sure if I‚Äôll ever move back but I hope my friends and family who live here see improvements to infrastructure and public education among other things. Nothing but love to H-Town and all y‚Äôall who continue to hold it down."
"I'm just as tired as everyone else. I wish I could start over and leave TX but the few family members I have left are here, and that's important to me too. Texas can and should do better."
"Yep I‚Äôm considering moving out 

Maybe College Station or San Antonio"
"If anything, it exposed how terrible Houstons infrastructure really is. 

It took a storm for people to realize if things go south there‚Äôs no telling wtf is going to happen"
"For those considering moving to a different city, I made a spreadsheet the last time a thread like this came up this week.  It has a breakdown of the top 50 US Metro areas by population (Wikipedia). CoL is a generic number.  Public link:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yr4sIjde-ZflSpU-_obfGJo2sazsj6AHcADskTH-tOU/edit?usp=drivesdk"
"I considered it after the Freeze. After last year's heat streak, I made up my mind.

I'll be moving out in September."
"I was telling a coworker this morning that this whole thing feels so different. Trees still fallen over, branches and limbs down all over the place‚Äîeven in the middle of major streets‚Äîwith city workers not even bothering to clean em up, streetlights still out in many places, got neighbors who take great care of their yards who have just left all the debris in their yard for more than a week now‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs like the city is experiencing a collective moment where we are all saying, ‚ÄòFuck it. I just don‚Äôt care anymore. I‚Äôm too fucking tired to give a shit.‚Äô"
"We‚Äôve thought about it for a while. North Texas is generally built for tornados as compared to a swamp bowl that refuses to bury power lines, cannot prepare for emergency management - ever - and is generally full of road raging, incompetent maniacs."
"It was a Cat 1 when it hit Texas. 

THIS WAS FROM A FUCKING CAT 1. 

We‚Äôre beyond fucked with this city‚Äôs incompetence."
Moved away from Houston after the summer of 2011. No regrets. Life is better in the Chicago burbs.
Everyone will forget come election time sadly and nothing will change üòî
"Meanwhile, my husband and I are trying to make our way back to Houston from CA but seeing everything that‚Äôs been going on, definitely makes me second guess our choice a bit."
"Grew up in Houston, moved away for 10 plus years as an adult and finally excitedly moved back last summer. Excitement wore off quickly. Moving again out of state and was feeling a little guilty/bad about leaving my ‚Äúhometown‚Äù again, but not anymore. Can‚Äôt wait to get the F out of Houston and Texas."
They keep blaming this on the storm and not the slow response and terrible communication from CP and the city.¬†
"Born and raised here in Houston and it‚Äôs hard for me to admit that I would like to live somewhere else but I can definitely confirm I have lost the interest in living here. So much stuff has been said in the past few weeks that there‚Äôs no way to deny the fact that we are getting completely fucked over and over again by the ‚Äúleaders‚Äù of the state, and I wouldn‚Äôt even say leaders but more just fucked up creatures that look like humans in positions of power. I‚Äôm interested in moving to Seattle and being close enough to travel to Vancouver when I want. As soon as I am able to make those moves, I‚Äôm outta here"
"I'm tired of Houston. So tired.

I have numerous physical disabilities, including quite severe asthma, arthritis, and more. Houston's air quality is terrible, the power grid is worse, and having to endure prolonged outages in Summer Heat feels like torture.

I was born here, but I'm so done with this city... my wife and I both are. The only thing stopping us from leaving is money."
I‚Äôm here another 8-10 years until my kids are out of school and then I‚Äôm finding an alternative
"If i had the opportunity and money, I'd definitely look to leave this state. Anytime it rains now, im sitting there wondering if power will fail."
Adding a home generator that's FO SHO.
I was more than ready and looking into leaving pre-Beryl. Watching my stubborn ass parents swelter in 98 degree weather without power for almost 2 weeks straight without staying with me despite being one of the lucky few to be in a wealthy and central enough area to retain power through Beryl sealed the deal for me. Just ridiculous governance in every way. Shameful. I'm born and raised for 23 years in Houston but I am not putting my roots down in this city. State gov already had me gone but this shit specific to this city is not doable.
"I‚Äôm held up a little while here in Denver at the airport. Chatting it up with a lot of travelers today, all commiserating on the clusterfuck. When I tell them I‚Äôm from Houston, all they can talk about is Beryl, and the fact that some are still without power. Not a good look for Abbott‚Äôs ‚ÄúTexas Miracle.‚Äù"
"Yep, planning now to gtfo by end of the year."
My family is still angry about the storm. They‚Äôll be living in NC with me in 2 weeks. The kids are traumatized from it.
"Honestly, not that bad of a storm but the lack of city Maintance with already dad trees and rotten power poles is what did it"
"I wish I could just pack up and move. Out of Texas preferably, but it's not that easy for many/most people unfortunately, including myself. Gotta have the initial funds, a job lined up, a job lined up that pays you a living wage for your new destination, etc. So much to take into account that many people can't just pack up and leave despite wishing they could"
Storms a nightmare. I would leave if my career wasn't here
"Lost the front of my house. Lost memories I can never replace. My husband is gone 6 months and my dog went 2 months before him and my Mom died a few months before that,the first night in this home! 
 I'm broken. I'm exhausted and no hope really. Beryl took the last of me if feels like. I survived Katrina in Nola though! 28 days no power. Brutal,but not this humid! Dew point meets humidity damn near daily. My body,my mind,  my hands and feet are all fully rebelling. At least a month more. It has caused my whole self to be unsafe...and my dog? Who is that barking mad man? I'm looking for a map to hope.Anyone seen it? I think finances pick where I stay. I rent btw."
"Not the storm, Centerpoint, and the republican response of ""Fuck Houston, they vote democrat""."
Just an observation but I have not seen a single peep about Beryl outside of Texas subs. Wonder if it‚Äôs just the election stuff or the assassination stuff or bidens current Covid-fueled Twitter rampage or any of the million other reasons I could think of but don‚Äôt want to.
"Has anyone noticed that they have stopped cutting the tree branches away from the power lines?  Who is responsible for that. By the way, Beryl broke me as well.  I spent over $2000 dollars since the derecho on a generator, outdoor extension cables, fans, gas cans, 10 gallons of gas per day and finally a portable air conditioner."
"It‚Äôs a bluff. 

People claim ‚Äúthey are leaving‚Äù for a myriad reasons. But never do. 

I can remember a number a people that claimed they were leaving after someone got elected. They never left. üòÇ"
Seriously. I‚Äôve seen no less than 2 accidents a day in the east end. Everyone is agitated and confrontational. People are making matters worse with their piss poor attitudes. I understand and feel the anger too but we can‚Äôt let it out on each other.
Everyone should leave Texas. Take your tax dollars somewhere else.
"Ill be gone by next week. As a native Texan, it's not worth it anymore to stay."
"I‚Äôm from here, However, haven‚Äôt lived here for over a decade and have some time is regretted living elsewhere for a variety of reasons including family. This disaster has made me have little to no regrets about not living in Houston anymore. I mean, I‚Äôve been through hurricane Ike and I didn‚Äôt hear this much outrage about no power like I‚Äôm hearing with this storm."
I only went 24hrs with no power. I'm on dialysis I had to drive an hour for delayed emergency treatment that was a fraction of my normal one. I was sick for a week. I could have died. These clinics charge about 30k a month up to double that. To Medicare and ins. Each clinic easily has 20+40 patients a day. Fresenius and DaVita are multi billion dollars companies. Per year. THERE IS NO REASON THEU CANNOT AFFORD A GENERATOR ON EACH CLINIC. oddly I'm California and Arizona all of not half have generators on them. Yeah they never need them. However in here I'm TEX-ASS in the heart of hurricane tornado country not a single clinic has them. Wonder why ?? Because the state doesn't make them. I can guarantee you patients on dialysis have died after this storm. No one will count them as a hurricane death. Just another kidney failure patient. On can live on dialysis for 15+ years easily. If you take xare if yourself and start young. 20+ is not unheard of.
"I wonder if Centerpoint cares that they are the singular reason why thousands of people want to leave Houston, a great city that deserves a decent power grid."
"A couple more storms like this one (this year) and Houston will probably be a ghost town, but weather is getting crazy everywhere you can go ."

Born and raised Houstonian. I have been living out of state since being in the military. I had the choice this year to move back. I decided against it and Beryl and the freeze are huge reasons why. I don‚Äôt want to live in uncertainty with the power grid.
"People are mad but no one here is smart enough to change who they are voting for. In the end reality makes no difference it‚Äôs a brand. Texas is Republican and the more solidified that happens the more they can fuck with us. I don‚Äôt care about sides I‚Äôm sure any party would be corrupt if they were guaranteed to win every election. 

Anybody complaining here vote Republican in the past but is now going to change? Show of hands."
We leave next May. Already setting up camp elsewhere. A blue state for sure.
"New York interviewed renters with damaged rent homes, sure easy for them to move. Lucky to have no major damage. Though each disaster has had couple thousand in repaires. Home insurance is way higher, 5,500 State Farm, another 900 for fema. Never made a claim."
"Born and raised here and I hope the majority of y‚Äôall leave.  I love y‚Äôall, but it‚Äôs just too many of y‚Äôall.  And y‚Äôall all seemed to arrive at the same time.  That many people puts a strain on everything.  If y‚Äôall all leave at the same time and tell your friends how bad it is here, maybe we‚Äôll be able to drive all of our freeways like we used to."
I hope people leave! It‚Äôs overly crowded everywhere
Just buy a generator.  You'll be ok. Can't afford one? Use a buy now pay later company like Affirm to purchase one with low monthly payments.
Fuck Houston
"I‚Äôll never forget back in 2017 when my Wife told me she wanted to move back to Houston. We had been living in Atlanta for 2 years and just had our first child. She wanted to be closer to Family and at the time that made all the sense in the world. 

I remember we finally came to the decision to move back in June of 2017. Neither one of us was really excited to move back but knew it would be the best decision to make with having our first child to be closer to family. 

Now I wasn‚Äôt excited to move back due to me enjoying living in the Atlanta metro. Don‚Äôt get me wrong Houston and Atlanta has some similarities. Houston‚Äôs food was much better( but I also was in better shape and we saved more money cause we didn‚Äôt eat out as much) and I did miss the diversity of Houston. I‚Äôm also Texan originally from East Texas so being away from my Family in ETX and in Houston was a bit of a bummer. But outside of those things I didn‚Äôt miss living in Houston as much as I thought I would. Matter fact the 2 times we visited when we were living in Atlanta made me regret not moving out of Houston earlier. 

I can count on one hand how many times I had to deal with flooding while living in Atlanta. When it would rain heavily they never really lasted long and you didn‚Äôt have to worry about constant flooding driving home from work. 

Also there were actual 4 seasons and summers were tolerable. For 2 years I knew how it felt to live in a big city without having a nervous breakdown due to violent weather and piss poor infrastructure. 

So by the time we told our apartments we were no longer renewing our lease and I had already put in a transfer back to Houston did I get a reminder on why I was less stressed living in Atlanta than in Houston. That reminder was Harvey. We were living in Atlanta during Hurricane Harvey but watching the madness unfold on tv. Immediately I knew we were gonna regret moving back. 

Fast forward to today and now my Wife is coming around to the idea of moving back to Atlanta. She actually wanted to move out of Houston years ago but wanted to remain in Texas. She likes DFW but I can‚Äôt do Texas anymore period."
"I felt like this after the freeze for 43 seconds, which is the amount of time it took me to discover the amount of square footage I could afford anywhere else I‚Äôd be willing to live. (spoiler: divide your sq footage by 2, and multiple the rent/mortgage by 3)

I just consider it the Houston tax. Don‚Äôt forget to factor in a few thousand in repairs and 1-2 weeks of utter despondency every couple years. Still better than owning a dilapidated shack in buttfuck, California (after the emotional pain dissipates)"
"Considered it, but Houston is my home and unless I‚Äôm forced out I‚Äôm here to stay and at least to make things better"
"I never lost power for more than a minute due to Beryl, but I‚Äôve lived here for going on 8 years and cannot believe how fucked things are.

As a Midwest transplant, losing power for a couple days during the cold snap a few years back just blew my mind. I sat in my cold apartment thinking ‚ÄúSeriously? This is all the winter it takes for everything to fall to shit here?‚Äù"
Please leave too many people live here
Yeah people should totally do it.
Houston is an absolute Hell Hole and I can‚Äôt wait to leave.
I grew up in Houston and gave up on it over 20 years ago. I‚Äôve never understood why other people stayed.
"I would like to leave.. I‚Äôve been here for 45 years and been through bad storms and hurricanes.. What compounds how bad things get is the blatant greed and full tilt profiteering.. Compounding that is the ‚Äòfuck your feelings‚Äô compassion 
expressed from city and state government and freely distributed in the suburbs amongst the recently minted melanin-deprived upper-middle class..

I get it, I‚Äôm old and irrelevant.. 

This city/county is completely unprepared for a Cat 3 or 4 storm..
We are ripe for a Katrina event and the bumblefucks who run this place will be profoundly inept to deal with it..

Beryl has acutely demonstrated that fact, in action..

I‚Äôm very, very tired and dismayed at the general ‚Äòfuck you‚Äô attitude that stinks up this entire area.. 

And I‚Äôm looking right the fuck at you Cinco Ranch.."
Get a generator
I see your Beryl and raise you an Ike. Went for almost a month without power.  It's just something you live and cope with.  Gotta love them live oaks.
"When I moved here two years ago it was the first place I ever lived that the people in the place wanted to hear no wrong about their city, and talked down on every other city. What a funny vacuum bubble this place is.  I‚Äôm ironically in California for the month (where I‚Äôve heard them talk the most shit about, after NYC), and I‚Äôm enjoying paradise weather, amazing water and produce, and friendly worldly people who look happy, healthy and want to chat.  My Uber eats delivery people here look happier, friendlier and more in shape than the average person over there.  

Picky my apt building in Houston got power very quickly so I‚Äôve been able to help out my family and friends in the area."
I've lived here my entire life and I would absolutely leave if I could. Like this article mentions the fact that we insist on having our own power grid in Texas yet it doesn't hold up and doesn't keep us warm and freezing cold temperatures and doesn't keep us cool and sweltering ones is a huge factor. It will be one thing for people to be without power for a week after you know a huge hurricane. This was a category one. And I took it seriously but most people didn't. Everybody kept laughing reactions on Facebook to anybody that was actually had the nerve enough to try to make preparations. I thought about those people when I sat with no power a couple of days later and wondered if they were still laughing. In a state that has such crazy severe weather something needs to change. And they don't seem to be willing to do it.
Demand better. Singular party rule for 25+ years is the root cause. The marketplace of ideas needs to have more than one option.
Definitely broke me.
Yes we could use a few less people
can't blame them
Welp if we want a better city and state start by voting in all levels. Start by remove tjose who keep the unregulated power con going.
CNP profits above all else

Texans had seen that stupid crippled fuck as our governor since 2015 and they still decided to vote him back in. It‚Äôs a shame that Texan pride involves getting bent over a barrel and shown the 50 states as long as we have your guns.
"The only people that should have to pay for this are those that failed the people, the executive branch of the state government and anyone who bought their influence to save a buck."
"Everyone should stay, because Texas will be blue in less than 10 years. We can change not only Texas, but the entire country, by prying control away from those that don't give a shit about the greater good."
What are we even getting out of this city? We bust our ass to pay the insane housing costs and we can't even be guaranteed that we'll have the *privilege* of paying $200+ a month for electricity. The schools are in such a shitty state that the teachers themselves are outright telling their students that they don't give a shit. Cars are ending up on blocks overnight all over town and the police can't even be bothered to write a report about it half the time. I live in an expensive luxury apartment in a nice part of town and I still hear gunshots every other night. And whataburger has gone so far downhill that I won't even eat there anymore. The fuck are we doing.
People need to learn to be self reliant. So many who wait on others to take care of them.
"Not gonna lie, if a bunch do, I won't complain. I long for the days of Covid lighter traffic again."
"Later, lol.  Not anything new for us veterans.

Childlike mentality."

Good glad transplants are leaving. That will help ameliorate a lot of the city‚Äôs problems.
"It's the lack of resources and change. If the asshole corrupt idiots in charge did something to hold the electric companies accountable and they required finding solutions to the flooding then this would be a different story.

The horror is caused by the storms, the misery is caused by the politicians and utility companies."
One word: Hellscape!!
"Why have people forgotten hurricanes exist?   Why did power companies stop trimming the trees as they did after Rita?     None of this is new, except people‚Äôs surprise and power companies lack of preparation.   Beryl was only a Cat 1."
"When the negatives outweigh the positives then Houston will stop growing. Anyone is free to leave, once the jobs, culture and delicious taqueria food aren‚Äôt enough."
"GOOD, out with the weak, keep Houston Strong! /s"
Move so yall can complain about something new
"Lower house prices you say?

Sign me up!

That said, this is the pinnacle of right-wing deregulated idiocy meets left-wing cronyism. We need to drop the partisanship and stay and fight!

Edit: not leaving, already have a dual fuel generator, but buying more Ecoflows and upping my emergency supply of food and water to 30 days. Infrastructure is crumbling everywhere, it's just that the crumbling isn't equally distributed. But it's coming to a city near you if it hasn't already arrived."
good riddance
Anybody that would make their sole decision to leave a city based on a Hurricane is a MORON.
People are stupid. You should expect some inconvenience after a storm.  Mother nature can not be controlled.
