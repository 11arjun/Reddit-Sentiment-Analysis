"These big storms bring the attention, but the electricity fails way more often and gets no attention. Summer 2020 we lost power 4 Sundays in a row, for the entire day. The week before the derecho we lost power for two days. There's been countless other days since 2017 where we lost 4+ hours of power at our house."
You know shit is bad when space city weather calls you out...
"No shit. The city has the worst power grid I've ever lived in. I think some solutions like concrete poles and buried distribution lines are solid but will take decades to fully implement - far too late to help solve the problem today. I think there are solutions we can do today that will be effective in a reasonably short (<1 year) window.

- Pass a city ordnance that forbids any trees within x feet of a main power line that serves more than 1 block. This would apply to public and private property.

- Grant the utilities the right to remove trees on private property that fail to meet the prior stipulation.

- Mass trimming campaign of trees near smaller distribution lines starting as soon as power is restored.

- Mandate backup generation (not batteries) at internet service providers and cell towers in areas with more than a certain density.

- More proactive staging of recovery crews at a lower threshold of damage. We shouldn't be waiting 2 days for out of town crews to show up. 

- More stockpiling of transformers, poles, lines etc. The AI boom has a gold rush of tech companies buying all of this for their datacenters. We should get ahead of the curve and stock enough to get to 4 of these events."
RIP Reliant sponsorship for them. Good to see though.
"What we need is a feasible, concrete plan from a genuine expert. That would us something to productively advocate for.

One thing I would like to see is to aggressive trim or cut down trees that pose a danger to the power lines. That would be cost effective, quick to implement and there is no excuse to have this many lines downed by  branches and trees."
"dropping in from Austin where we had similar huge problems in the big freeze and a couple other minor freezes.

The solution is to bury the power lines. Yes it is very expensive, but its really the only solution I see. Our city council is starting to study the feasibility. It doesn't need to all be done at once. But a study needs to be done to see which lines are most vulnerable to wind and start burying some X% per year from most risk to least risk.

Even though its expensive, so is tree trimming, so is having line crews dealing with storms every month."
Time to start burying the powerlines.
This is the voters fault. Educate yourselves on deregulation and stop voting for idiots that prefer a business had more rights than the citizens paying.
"We need & deserve change in our government, & not just at a local level either. Beryl was a Category 1 & it left over a million without power. We are going to be getting major storms, it is an inevitability, and we just proved we cannot handle a category one. Buckle up buttercup."
"Unfortunately, the people of Texas and Houston elect incompetent republicans who only care about the wealthy."
"Unfortunately, we deserve exactly what we got. 😔"
"Since there are those trying to get Texas to secede from the union, can we secede from Texas?"
Energy City? More like Energy Shitty.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
"we got an unreliable and “maybe” map, we can put away the whataburger map! "
"Would’ve been real nice if these guys didn’t spend the majority of the week prior to this event underselling the potential impacts of Beryl to us.

It wasn’t until Friday they finally changed their tone in messaging and even then, pitched this more as a rainmaker than impactful wind event. 

I appreciate the work these guys do, have followed their blog for years and certainly will continue to do so. 

Hopefully they put some more focus on messaging potential impacts to Houston in the future, even if the majority of models agree on tracks elsewhere because we see the fallout from this all over. It creates a false sense of security that corporations and government make decisions off of and then we all pay for. 

Disaster declaration was delayed until after the event happened instead of preemptive.   

Centerpoint didn’t plan. 

Houston police didn’t plan.   

Houston hospitals didn’t plan.   

The list goes on and on."
"Nothing will change until those at the top (at centerpoint, local and regional government) actually suffer.   Suffer in the heat, suffer with loss of property, suffer with the uncertainty of not knowing when the power will come back on.  I GUARNT-GODDMAN-TEE YOU THAT THE CEO OF CENTERPOINT IS NOT SUFFERING."
"IS THAT WHAT IT DESERVES??

How many oil companies we home to?"
"Eric's refusal to state the most simple and direct explanation for this disaster—25 years of Republican rule in Texas caused this—tells you what his words are worth. I used to respect the guy, but this is some grade-A horseshit he's slinging. Dancing around the facts is not what scientists should be doing."
"We paid for one, the greedy motherfuckers at Centerpoint(less) stole the money."
"Ultimately it boils down to cost to the end consumer. Before winter storm Uri we had rates around 7-9 cents per kWh. After Uri we're paying for it with higher rates, 13-14 cents per kWh these days. Now that Beryl has come along it's obvious there are improvements to be made, and we'll have to pay for those too. Are folks willing to pay 20-25 cents per kWh for more reliable service after Beryl? Can Centerpoint build a ""weather-proof"" distribution system, and are you willing to pay 50 cents per kWh for it? $1.00 per kWh? How much are people willing to spend for electricity?"
"Berger and Lanza are trying their hardest to go militant on CenterPoint to deflect blame from themselves for downplaying this storm. How can you blame CenterPoint for not prepping when YOU were only convinced this was a threat a couple days before the storm? Hypocrites.

“We’re not really concerned about Hurricane Beryl and Texas.” Matt Lanza, July 1."
