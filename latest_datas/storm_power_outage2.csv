"UDATE5 2230 on 7/12:

- The 345kV autoxfmr in the immediate area along with a corresponding crosstown 138kV line (through the Heights to Liberty/Wayside/Crosby) are still on outage. A tentative return of 7/13 1700 remains unchanged for the xfmr, the line segment estimates have not been updated, still showing 7/10 2200. Speculation: the damage on these two particular segments appears to be heavy because the other segments returned on 7/10 as expected. There is likely some major snag like heavy equipment, fallen high-kV towers, or loss of critical equipment at the stations. Power can get to the Heights without this line but my guess is that it is the impact right now.

- Belfort and Kirby, nearby major load breaker is on outage, started today at 0900 and runs until 7/15 1700.

- Work is slated from Pearland through Friendswood, League City, towards the coast by Dickinson. This complex of lines will be out tomorrow from 0700 to 1700. Impacts will likely be minimal, they are trying to avoid disrupting more customers.

- Work in Galveston is largely complete on high kV lines.

I ask you kindly, *please* **do not blame or attack the linemen/line workers**.  They are trying their best, lack of prep and vegetation management, system hardening, etc are not *their fault*.  Please treat them with respect, they are working very hard to get things back.

---------------------

UPDATE4:  0915 on 7/11:

- Not a ton of changes overnight, mainly times updated for work going on today.  Work end around noontime in areas:  Greenspoint, Lake Houston/BW8, central Pasadena, 59/Fannin (ends 1700), and Addicks.  These are all breaker outages generally related to re-energization of the high kV (read: big) lines.  

- All of the major 345kV lines have been back while one major 138kV line crossing town from 290/610 through the Heights to Beaumont remains out in two sections.  This work was scheduled to come back last night at 2200 and did not, no new estimate.

- One major 345kV xfmr is out of service near 290/610 along the aforementioned string coming out of the Heights.  This is not expected to return until 1700 on 7/13 (end of Saturday).  This may be one of the reasons CNP is giving guidance for restorations continuing into Sunday.

- While I know this all sucks so bad, the line crews did an pretty good job of restoring the high kV lines ahead of schedules in most cases.  The problem is increasingly going to the last few miles of low kV distribution lines that feed your street.  That means each line fixed is increasingly less 'bang for the buck' in terms of customers restored, simply because they've hit most of the big ones.

-------------------

UPDATE3:  2140 on 7/10:

- lines from Addicks to WP/BW8 to Bellaire returned to service

- major breaker in south Pasadena returned to service

- the crosstown work may have hit snags with the middle section that traverses the Heights still scheduled for outage ending 7/10 2200 so that work is likely to be moved to tomorrow.  This includes a major xfmr at 610/290 that is scheduled to come back 7/13 1700

Points to remember:

- major lines feed the smaller lines.  This is all information about major lines, not the lines that go to your house or even feed your neighborhood.  These are big big lines that are the backbone of the system.

- lines going out of service is normal, particularly when things need to be de-energized to fix them.  Most of the time de-energizations happen and you never even know it because other lines handle the change but right now it's very possible to gain power and then lose it again.  I know that it incredibly frustrating, but it's really the only way.

- most work is likely moving to the distribution network where visibility drops.  Currently it looks like they plan to wrap up major work by end of Saturday although that may easily move.

- likely outages will be updated and new plans come out overnight from the work this evening.

--------------------

UPDATE2: 1635 on 7/10:

- lines from Addicks to WP/BW8 to Bellaire are out of service as expected, given a return time of 1900 tonight.  We'll see.  If you lost power this afternoon along those areas, that's probably why.

- work on a major crosstown 138kV line through the Heights to Crosby is going out this evening (1630) and expected back at 2200.  This is likely to go out or may already be out, hopefully come back later tonight.

- some major work on the east side near the ship channel finished.

- work near 290/BW8 Cyprus area finished early (was slated for 7/12)

------------------
EDIT, UPDATE as of 1225 on 7/10:

- a new string of outages is planned in West Houston for **this afternoon**.  If you live in the regions of Westpark/59, Westpark/BW8, Eldridge from West Park north to Addicks, this whole string of lines may be out this afternoon.  Be aware you may lose power in these areas, hard to say.  This is associated with with updated Addicks breaker outage today.  If you are around these areas and do not have power, it is possible it will come back for some this evening if these outages finish.  

- 59 / Fannin / Main has an outage most of the day tomorrow

- an important outage in Bellaire is scheduled to come back at 1300 today but appears to be behind schedule.

- work is active across Galveston with many of the high kV lines to and on the island on intraday outage.

FYI the utility crews work super-hard during events like this, particularly the mutual assistance crews from out-of-state.  Don't yell at these poor guys, it's not their particular fault, they just fix things.  Please treat them like the semi-heros they are.

------------------------

What I can tell you from high-level ERCOT data as of 0920 on 7/10:

- most of the major 345kV lines (biggest size used in ERCOT) across the city have been restored, some ahead of schedule.  This includes lines into Bellaire and from Westpark/BW8 to 290/610.  Lines north from Humble to Tomball have come back as have major lines in Baytown.  Many of the 138kV (second-biggest size) have returned as well.

- some major 138kV lines extending to Galveston remain out past their initial expected return date, new estimates not yet provided.

- there are a lot of breaker outages that are schedule to be completed today.  These actions can often involve people with power losing it for a period to de-energize / re-energize a section of line.  I know this is the most frustrating thing in the world to lose power again but it is part of the process to restore the grid and must be done.

- those same breaker outages are now getting scheduled into tomorrow as well.  Often this implies a schedule of work that is increasingly being known.  Knowing what to do is the first step and largely that process seems to be complete.

- some breaker and xfmr outages have been extended, most stubbed dates are currently 7/12 or 7/13.  Consider those placeholders, they have been changing a lot with several lines scheduled for 7/12 returns back already.

- this is all at the high kV line level.  I cannot tell you anything about zip codes or neighborhoods or individual distribution lines.  However fixing the big branches is the next step, then smaller lines.

I just want to say that I have gotten far more communication from CenterPoint re: trying to sell me gas line insurance than I have about the outage in my neighborhood.
"The lack of communication is I think the thing we’ve strapped with the most. No map to see what’s going on with power. No estimated times for restoration, etc. 

No idea how bad it was at my place because haven’t been able to watch any news today, etc"
[deleted]
Centerpoint restoration seems to have stalled over last hour.
"FUCKING HELL. If CenterPoint would just tell us approximately when to expect power back, we could make informed decisions like whether to leave or not. I don’t want to load two little kids and a screaming cat in the car, drive for four hours to get to the closest hotel, then drop an extra couple hundred bucks on a room just to find out that our power was restored two hours after we left."
[deleted]
"Use the WhataBurger app, shows which establishments are out/on and is better than the CenterPoint tracker in a lot of instances"
77058 just came on. Clear Lake
still nothing off 1960 near willowbrook in NW cypress 77070 :/
Any tips for what to do with animals in the event power isn’t restored? I can power through but worried about my cats.  Besides plenty of water for them to drink
"77009 

I can’t do another 6 days without power, I genuinely might have to hit up my ex and tell her I’m sorry if it comes down to that long without power.

It’s so infuriating seeing power around me be restored. At least I could go to one of the local bars."
Tracker says 951k restored since Beryl. Who wants to bet it magically shoots up to their 1 million goal right before midnight?
"Ppl out here dying bro im at 7625 hammely blvd, and a lady died upstairs she didn't have her breathing machine"
"Make sure to keep updating the thread when your power turns back on guys. Maybe I'm missing them, but I haven't seen anything in the past few hours about a new location getting power back. We have enough people from all across Houston to PROVE that CenterPoint isn't doing their job. They claim they are working ""16 hours shifts"" and I personally think that's a load of garbage."
Just discovered from a FB group that someone has created a Google form for Houstonians to report power status. The [map](https://digital-client.com/) updates once an hour. Centerpoint can suck it.
"It's Friday and I have no idea if I'll get power today, or in August.

Heck of a job, Centerpoint."
This updated map is a complete JOKE!!!!
Why remove the thread that was strictly for people regaining power? Everyone saying they're still in the dark just makes it harder to find helpful information.
"I'm in 77006, midtown. A good chunk of us are without power, me since 6am. I feel like a lot of people have it, so I think they are moving on to larger fixes that can power more people. I would imagine they are just swatting big numbers. But, I am just going off of acedotal Ike."
"I know they are working through the night, but is that preliminary work to help them for tomorrow, or do I have a chance of all my lights turning on at 1am?"

"ERCOT updated outages this evening, most got new dates of 7/12 1700 return to service from original stubs of 7/9 1700.  Some equipment came back today, including two big 345kV lines across the city.  Scheduled outages for tomorrow are likely necessary to re-energize portions of west Houston around i10w/bw8 and around Pasadena and Humble all around 1300 tomorrow.  Big lines remain out in west Houston, Bellaire, and Deer Park.  Galveston saw some lines come back but major 138kV's remain out.  Outage ticket times are guesses in these cases, don't take them too seriously.

This information comes from ERCOT's MIS system which is somewhat archaic and difficult to use.

Sorry I don't have better news."
"77477 , 48 hours without power. Pray for me, i got a pregnant wife. All the other buildings in my complex have power besides ours. Some next level bullshit."
77008 - Heights and 18th power JUST came back on. Spread the word
"Bro, *where are the linemen?*"
"Drove around a bit and have not seen a single repair truck today. 

What the fuck are they even doing?"
I just moved here literally 7/1 from Buffalo ny. In Buffalo I have been thru blizzards with way more damage and wind.. and I have never in my life experienced a place with power that goes so easily. Put some power lines in the mega road structures every dollar is being wasted on. This is infuriating
"Any updates for heights 77008

Update : still no damn power"
"I still can’t believe I’m going through another Ike sweat fest 16 years later for a cat 1 hurricane. Our utilities infrastructure quality has regressed unchecked. 

Edit: 77035 Orange Gang rise up"
"Please email this thread to media, upload it to a server and print hard copies before you take it down. By the time anyone cares to have formal investigations, both txlege and centerpointless will have asses covered."
Well strap in for another night...
Day 5 and don't even have so much as an ETA. Fuck Centerpoint
77077 energy corridor. Had a power outage since 6:30am. Just received power now at 10pm
Still no power in 77019 Montrose area. It is now 1:02 am. No power for about 14 hours.
[deleted]
"So at 8AM, CenterPoint said there were almost 1,400,000 customers without power. The latest update says that they've restored power to ONLY 28,000 people. This is absurd."
"So if my location doesn't have an estimated time of restoration, I should give up all hope for tonight, right?"
Got an email from CP stating power was back on. Online my account says the power is on. I drove to my house and the power is still out. Enraging.
"77055 I’m fucking losing it man. 6 days no power post derecho. Day I get power my dad fucking dies and now this. Fuck center point, fuck abbott fuck them all I can’t keep this up man"
77024 woke up with my power back at around 3am.
"The ""customers restored in the last 24 hours"" metric is falling pretty quickly"
"You should leave this up for another TWO weeks, given that there will still be people waiting by then."
"77471 Rosenberg finally has power, I want to freaking cry.

Don't trust them lads, once things calm down start saving up for a generator and window AC. A lot of us might be good now but I don't trust them to be ready the next time a storm comes along. But more importantantly vote. them. Out!

Never again are we sleeping drenched in sweat desperately calling every overbooked hotel in a 100 mile radius thanks to these bozos."
The lack of updates over night and into the morning is distressing.
"Lord its raining again. I never got power back, I'm just gonna assume I won't get power back for yet another week at this point."
"77077 energy corridor, briar forest Eldridge area. Power on as of 2:19 pm 7/12. Im at a hotel but my ring camera is on and I can see that my modem is on. Hope everyone else in the area gets their power soon🤞"
“Pending review”….man fuck
"If ""restoration date pending review"" means ""sometime after July 19th"" I'm going to throw literal shit at Centerpoint execs."
I'm in the Humble area 77396...completely pitch black and sounding like jurassic park outside with the insects.
77071 without power for about 20 hrs. Center point says that by WEDNESDAY they’ll have 1M back in service but there’s close to 2M without power. I’m frustrated 🤕
77006 by substation on tuam/fairview power back on woo!!!!! Instead of sad drinking we are happy drinking!!!! Woooooo!!!!!
"77007 Washington/Memorial - still no power or running water. Is any one else without water, or am I just in an unlucky pocket? All businesses and other apt complexes around me have power tho"
"Anecdotally, it seems like the repairs are slowing down.  Only one of my friends had their power restored."
77060 but I don’t mind waiting. My heart goes out to those most at risk and with pets. I’ll live.
"Welp, looks like another night of sweating. Turns out the first 3 houses on our side of the street have power so the problem is a particular post behind the 3rd neighbors house. We've been classified as light green or mostly energized so I imagine we aren't priority and won't get power till next week. Fuck Centerpoint."
"Mom in Richmond, I’m in Westchase, no power. Sister just outside River Oaks has power, but no water. How a nearly non-hurricane did this makes no sense to this lifelong Houstonian."
"I'm in 77096. My neighbors across the street from me have power and those on my side do not. There are countless instances of this exact same thing all across Houston, and it really makes no sense.
CenterPoint admitted they weren't prepared because ""the storm was worse than predicted"". I'm sorry, but during the time of year when we regularly hit TRIPLE DIGITS in temperature, you'd think these morons over at CenterPoint would prepare for the worst.
While I'm writing this because I'm bored and don't have shit else to do, I also think someone needs to be held accountable for this mess.
Almost 1.5 million people are still without power."
Anyone know any updates on Harris County areas because this is ridiculous.
77057 by the galleria and we’ve been out of power since monday 9:30am currently 5:44am tuesday and woke up sweating. i really worry about my cats and how they’ll do tomorrow:(
Got the email from Centerpoint in 77063 saying our power was restored. Tis a lie.
77008 behind Torchy's...power on!
"77090, no power. Been here for Allison, Ike, Rita, all of them. I've never been without power this long. In a hotel that I can't afford and I started vacation today. Thankful I don't have to work during this time but bitter I can't spend it in my apt. "
"Yall I cannot

I haven't slept a wink all night, just crying and be nauseated. I'm sleeping on a palette in my parents bedroom. They're running a portable ac unit off a generator. Even then somehow I managed to either get upset to my stomach or get heat exhaustion

I just need someone to talk to in the darkness. My parents are asleep:("
F\*ck centerpoint and their negligent behavior and intentional lack of transparency.
"As of 7/11 8:40PM…:.They are shutting power back off in some areas in Missouri City, drove by whataburger and it was pitch black…(it was opened yesterday)….I politely drove home and laid back down In the DARK. ATT Internet is down, can’t work from home, TMOBLE cellphone towers down , operating on LTE …can’t call customer service without having to repeat each word over and over and over again. Bout to lay in the dark and suck my thumb 👍!!!!"
77064 power out again… HAHAHAHAHA what a joke… you have to laugh to stop yourself from crying… fucking ridiculous
so… does anyone know the likelihood of someone in a “partially energized” area getting power back any time soon if there aren’t even people out working on the downed lines yet…? because their map is starting to look more like centerpoint jerking themselves off marking outages as restored because a couple of commercial buildings have power on the circuit 😭
for giving “substantially everyone” an estimation there’s still a lot of people with no ETA on that map.
Bru my shit say july 12 … its 10:47pm u mfs im STILL IN THE DARK
"77008 14th street near heights high school - electric crew said everything here is fixed, they are just running tests for safety to turn it all back on today - guess we'll wait and see

For reference, this area is marked on the centerpoint map as needing review for restoration date and was previously marked ""energized"""
77008 no power. In laws in 77005 no power. Really contemplating heading to the hill country tomorrow to stay with my parents.

> * Not a ton of changes overnight, mainly times updated for work going on today. Work end around noontime in areas: Greenspoint, Lake Houston/BW8, central Pasadena, 59/Fannin (ends 1700), and Addicks. These are all breaker outages generally related to re-energization of the high kV (read: big) lines.

> * All of the major 345kV lines have been back while one major 138kV line crossing town from 290/610 through the Heights to Beaumont remains out in two sections. This work was scheduled to come back last night at 2200 and did not, no new estimate.

> * One major 345kV xfmr [transformer] is out of service near 290/610 along the aforementioned string coming out of the Heights. This is not expected to return until 1700 on 7/13 (end of Saturday). This may be one of the reasons CNP is giving guidance for restorations continuing into Sunday.

> * While I know this all sucks so bad, the line crews did an pretty good job of restoring the high kV lines ahead of schedules in most cases. The problem is increasingly going to the last few miles of low kV distribution lines that feed your street. That means each line fixed is increasingly less 'bang for the buck' in terms of customers restored, simply because they've hit most of the big ones."
Starting to think 77024 is one of the worst zip codes to live in when it comes to losing power . . . Last time when the derecho hit we were out of power for like 6 days
The number of affected customers has been going *up* this morning. 
77007 by St Thomas High School - no power still
Is CP just randomly changing outage map to green and increasing numbers of restored customers in the tracker? Wtf 😂
"Day 6 of no power, ""energized"" with no power, not a single electrical truck on the road. I don't know how everyone in Richmond/Rosenberg has power, but us. Genuinely wondering if legal action can be taken at this point."
You would think with so many people having power again the rest of the repairs would go faster since theres more people to work on things... 
77498 Fort Bend still out. Been out since 5am
"Pinehurst area, 77355 (magnolia). Pitch black, no T-Mobile data at all. Drove into Tomball and as soon as I crossed into Harris County, the lights and cell internet are on.

No power in 77479 (Sugar Land) for 24 hours now. We have guests from out of town. Welcome to Texas!
77007 power came back a few minutes ago. Enjoying the ceiling fan while I can. Hope it stays on long enough for the AC to do some work.
POWER RESTORED TO MY NEIGHBORHOOD IN 77033! YIPPEEEE
"77092 and feeling like I'm one of those unlucky ones part of the 'nested outage' since 80% of neighbors have had lights since Tuesday. I just wish I knew what the time line for fixing everything was, feeling so sick of all the sweaty, dark waiting."
77003 power restored. We need to talk about holding centerpoint accountable.
"***Update**** 

Power back on but not all houses on Dickson unfortunately (per my HOA)


77007 still nothing (right by St. Thomas HS). I was already planning to move but am in the middle of fixing a few things up with a contractor. This experience makes me realize I don’t care if I sell at a loss, I’m gtfo. I moved here the year of Harvey and I’m leaving with Beryl."
[deleted]
"After nearly 190 hours, power is finally back on at 77004 near 288/mcgowen"
"Centerpoint is saying that they'll be up to 1 million restored ~~tomorrow~~ by EOD Wednesday. Right now they're just under 300k from the initial 2.2m, so you have about 35-40% odds of getting your power restored by then if you're still out."
77504 power came back and then 40 mins later a branch fell and cut our power FML
"Hot, sweaty miserable. My freezer is leaking everywhere. Will have to toss a bunch of food! For the 3rd time in a year. I feel like shit. Didn’t sleep a wink. I am so fucking angry right now. Also just learned that Centerpoint is just now starting to send out crews… 26 hours later. Fuck everything right now lol."
Where the Phuck are all the center point truck repairs when no one can find them anywhere repairing 
At least 3 admits to our medical service today related to no AC. Bullshit. Our elderly and sick deserve better.
"77008 lost power around 9am, still nothing"
"77007, pls tell me it's possible to get power turned on during the night. I'm trying to cool off any way I know how, but I can't sleep and I have an elderly parent with me. 
I know there are 3 cooling centers open for tomorrow, but does anyone know of any more ? "
Power just came on at 12:45 am in 77062.
"77054, still out :("
77056 - my apartment complex has power back! Got the email about 30 minutes ago.
"Just got a Center point text saying our power was restored, which is FALSE."
77006 near Rudyards. No power for my whole street yet. We all lost it about 10 AM yesterday. All the houses and business around us have power. It’s maddening.
[deleted]
77006 in a small pocket of three houses + a parking lot with no power but literally everyone around us is lit up 😭. Worried about my cats.
"77379 right by KHS still no power 50 hours in. We’ve done a good bit of driving around and have not seen a single utility truck on the roads, in parking lots, or working in the areas we have driven through."
"No power still in my area. Ironically tho I’m driving down Wesleyan towards the Greenway Plaza Costco and encounter several downed lines just laying in the right lane of the road only to see about a dozen lineman trucks with dudes inside just chilling in the Costco parking lot less than a minute drive away.

I know these dudes are there and ready to work. How the fuck is CP management failing this bad at organizing their labor?"
77008 any updates near 14th? We’re starting to get nauseous and the pets aren’t eating. This is WITH a generator and window unit. It’s still 89 in here
I'm about to crash out
Would be nice if any linemen were lurking here on a dinner break and could give some info.
"77098 no power still.. we are literally one of the  buildings within our complex that still doesnt have power. They have no clue when itll be resolved.

Happy for our neighbors and I’m trying to remain positive, but its starting to get to me 🥹"
77379 - still no power :(. I'm tired of this.
[deleted]
77066 - We're free. Power is on.
77056 still no power since Monday 9am and it’s Tuesday 2:50am now 😩
"77095, lost power at around 6-7am .. came back on at about 6pm and then back out again at around 8pm. It’s 3:30am now and still out 😢"
"77077, power just clicked on at 5 am. I've never been happier!"
Supposedly the crews that finally made it are getting their safety briefing this morning. We should start seeing power restored soon (slowly)
77095 checking again. No power but went out and drove some and zero sign of centerpoint trucks. Love it
Crying in 77450 Cinco Ranch/Highland knolls. Some areas around Kingsland seem to have power but nothing here. Finally pulled the trigger on a generator—-I don’t want to do this again! Dogs and cats and humans are all miserable 😭.
My entire street in the Heights is green on the map but I don’t have power and in fact have a downed line in my yard. How can I make sure I’m not passed over? I am terrified they think I have power somehow because all of my neighbors do
Taking my dog to a friends house in San Marcos. Very thankful for the people in my life. Keep your pets safe. 
"They changed the map sometime this afternoon. Energized got broken into ""energized"" and ""energized with potential nested outage"". Most of what was energized was migrated into the second category, of course"
"66hrs still no power spring 77379 wires blocking the entrance northwest memorial, 0 work done ."
"77077 - briar forest and d. ashford - still no power as of 5am Monday.
The neighborhood across from us - 77079 - never lost power. We’re staying with them until power gets restored or until they kick us out.. whichever comes first.

I haven’t seen a single service truck all week. I’ve been going back and forth cleaning, emptying the refrigerator, checking mail, etc.


I have a hunch CP over extended themselves from the last storm and the linemen are hesitant to return due to open/unpaid invoices. That’s just my opinion. I work in the services industry."
77036 Forum Park still in the dark it’s crazy. 90° inside the buildings when it’s 9PM at night. Madness. ^FUCKCENTERPOINT
"It's 12 PM. Tick-tock, Centerpoint."
"Power flickered twice here, just wow. 77008"
"77006 (Montrose). Had power restored early Wednesday. My parents (77346) had power restored Wednesday but lost it for ~2 hours today before it came back on. Brother (77346, in the same neighborhood my parents are in) got power back about 15 minutes ago. Sister (77396) still has no power. Xfinity is still out for everyone.   

Driving home from work today, I'd say >50% of street lights remain out, including multiple downtown intersections on Louisiana; Westheimer and Montrose; and West Gray and Waugh. Be careful -- asswipes are running intersections left and right without even pretending to stop. I messaged my boss I'm not coming in tomorrow. It's not worth it. 

Side note: I gassed up on Friday at $3.49/gallon for premium. Today I paid $4.59."
Still no power in 77040. I’m pissed because people down the street have power but not here
Well.. this storm just set us back 😩 i saw 3 lineman working 77090 then boom.. gone 😭😭😭😭
77024. By Chimney Rock and I-10. No one is even in the area lmao. Leaving Houston after this.
I was in the partially energized zone of the map until now. They have us in that shade of teal that is pending date
77373 - Some houses have power
"On a walk this morning I saw at least 6 work trucks in a very small area, east of Heights between 20th and 17th. Hopefully y'all get it back real soon."
77017 near Hobby Airport/Pasadena still down since 6am…..praying that sleep takes me soon and that I wake up to AC lol
Whataburgers always have power. We should just put them in charge of the grid honestly. They’d probably do a better job than Centerpoint.
"CenterPoint has not done a good job keeping us updated.  Clear and specific information that we were used to during previous outages has been replaced with generic ""updates"" this time around.  It's frustrating that CenterPoint took down the outage map.  It feels like the company is withholding information."
The Whataburger app coming in clutch is something I did not expect lmao
Feeling depressed I don't want to go through another night with no power I have work I can't clean my uniform or take a shower. I can't book a room with no availability and I can't leave town. I feel like a trapped rat. 77011
I can’t believe a category 1 took the power out for this long. I just moved to Houston in May from Florida 🥲
"> Based on current progress with its damage assessment and initial restoration, CenterPoint now expects to have 1 million impacted customers restored by the end of the day on Wednesday, July 10.

So not even half the people are expected to have power by end of Wednesday according to them"
"77024 @ Memorial & Chimney Rock. No power since the early AM. Took 6 days to get power back after the derecho, but I’m hopeful we’ll get it sooner this time around"
[deleted]
77095 still out. Not a truck in sight. And my solar fans just died after running like champs since the outage. But I can’t recharge until sun comes up. It’s so hot and stuffy in here. I feel so gross.
77007 still no power
The number of customers affected went up 😭
"77008, W 23rd and Bevis

Just got power back. Looks like the updates from the crews being there was accurate."
[deleted]
It would help a lot if when posting your status you include the closest major intersection.
77459 - neighborhood near HEB on Austin parkway + hwy6 has power 
any updates on 77008?
"The insider guy who commented about transmission lines this morning added another update to his comment, about 45min ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/lcik1fn/

> UPDATE2: 1635 on 7/10:

> * lines from Addicks to WP/BW8 to Bellaire are out of service as expected, given a return time of 1900 tonight. We'll see. If you lost power this afternoon along those areas, that's probably why.

> * work on a major crosstown 138kV line through the Heights to Crosby is going out this evening (1630) and expected back at 2200. This is likely to go out or may already be out, hopefully come back later tonight.

> * some major work on the east side near the ship channel finished.

> * work near 290/BW8 Cyprus area finished early (was slated for 7/12)"
"For those in 77008, I’m driving to dinner and I saw a bunch of out of state utility trucks near 11th street park, and another set near ETC Jester and Wynnwood"
"77054, 8181 Fannin St, power was back at 6 pm. Thank you to the lineworkers (men and women) who worked under high temperatures the entire day. Hope that everyone here will get their power back soon."
77070 my 249ers and cypresswood ppl we are back up 🎉🎉🎉🎉
77379 near grand parkway and kuykendahl. Still no power despite the whataburger and other businesses across the way having it :'(
77008 back on at 7 PM on Wednesday at Shepherd and 16th
"77477. Of course, the Starbucks and Mcdonalds right behind my house have power and stay blasting their bright ass lights through my windows.

Sleeping on my roof in nothing but my undies has been quite pleasant, though. I've been getting stares from the McD's drive thru, but fuck em."
77007 washington ave still no power…
77007 near Cleveland park. I see repair crew! However they are not center point - I guess they are contracting in some outside help? These pics were taken on Jackson hill https://imgur.com/a/wo7nlGs
"77379 So much for Centerpoint providing restoration times on it's ""restoration status tracker"" before noon today as promised. No updates to the shitty map since 7am. Not that I'm surprised."
"Centerpoint said they'd have estimated times to fix power, where is that supposed to be at?"
[deleted]
I'm seeing that some of you guys have gotten estimates on when your power will come back; where are y'all getting them? Was it an email from Centerpoint?
just got power back on 77459 near Lexington/dulles!
"Still no power 77007. It’s time to start bombarding them with calls https://fletcher.house.gov/forms/form/?ID=103
7133538680 can everyone start calling their rep and whoever else they can think of? This is absurd. At least we can be a pain in the ass or a mild irritation to these people who don’t give a f if thousands start calling nonstop?? I don’t see any other alternative besides the French way but we need to take our anger outside of this app and put it directly on those who are supposed to do something. Like they shouldn’t have the phone stop ringing for a minute until this is over. If you were in office, isn’t that what you’d be expecting?"
seems they don’t get much done overnight.
"77019 - Power restored (at least on La Rue street by Waugh & W. Dallas). 

FYI - we’ve been in blue since they released the map. They never gave an estimate for when power would be restored. The map still shows us as blue. 

I feel so so grateful 😭😭 I’m praying all my fellow Houstonians/texans get their power restored ASAP! This was hell "
[deleted]
Yeahhhh the storm that's blowing through NWHouston rn is giving me major anxiety.  I'll probably have a meltdown if my power goes out again...
77063 hopeless 😩 
"We are live in 77007, Yale & Washington"
"77092 @ Magnum and Pinemont

I'm done with today. Just chased half a Xanax with a shot of tequila.

Hoping to wake up tmrw with power but not holding my breath."
"77007, Washington Ave. across from Porta'Vino. No power or water since ~9:30 A.M. Monday."
Serious question: how the fuck has a state of emergency/disaster not been called yet? Nearly 50% of the population loses power in sure people could use those resources such as FEMA etc at this point. This city is so frustrating sometimes.
"50% of Entergy customers are supposed to be back on by Wednesday evening. 

For reference, when Beryl was a category 4 that hit Jamaica, 45% of JPS (Jamaica’s power company) customers had power within 24 hours.

How on earth is the 4th largest city in the US and “energy capital” doing worse than an island for power restoration? Maybe I should move back to the East coast…"
No hate but it's unhelpful to say power is up in your zip without a cross street or landmark.
77036 power went out around 6am and i don't have power back yet.
77004.  Down since 9:30 am and not back on yet
77006 still out despite the people across the street having power. can’t even bother trying to reach centerpoint. what a jokep
"77009, lost power shortly after 8 this morning and haven’t gotten it back."
"77433 no power since 6am, family in 77429, 77070 and 77354 all still no power"
77006 near Milam still no power
Power back in 77375

"77006, still no power but got a power spike at 3:50ish"
77008 no power since 9:30 yesterday
77459 - I saw crews working at the towers by hightower high school
"77074 Shapstown bellaire side, we're still out of power, and it keeps getting hotter. I'm hoping it comes back today. Looks like I'm missing spain v france in the Euros. Damn it."
77006 - Power is ON! Camden Midtown (Milam and Louisiana at Hadley). And there was much rejoicing.
[deleted]
So did anyone get power back during the night last night? Like is it possible that they’re working overnight or do we give up hope until tomorrow? Thanks!
77056 everyone in neighborhoods around us has power but we’re still without 🥺
"77066: contractors (?) in trucks marked ""Premium"" spotted. Two small fleets, both near Hobby Lobby on FM 1960. At around 8:30 am, one group was having a very large huddle/meeting. We hope they will fix residential power in short order..."
I think they forgot about 77057. All three of the closest traffic lights are out and I‘m over here with nothing but a tiny fan and little power bank keeping me cool slowly losing the will to live
Anyone else see the restoration counter on the outage tracker just jump from 985k to 1 mill mere minutes before the 5 pm deadline? Can't make this shit up.
77006 just got home to confirm. Hallelujah
77008 near SPJST Lodge just got power back
"77008 - Spoke to a lineman, the repairs don’t start until tomorrow morning."

(77070)Another day sleeping in the car since there’s no power in our area but few blocks away got power 😔😩
77007 near Cleveland park still out 😡
77069/Willowbrook area here. Does anyone have any updates specifically for that part of 1960?
77008 checking in at TC and Bevis and power is back
"77003. No power, going on day four. A shit sandwich "
"77459 - Just did a drive around Sienna. There is gas available at the HEB on 6, the Shell just into Sienna and the Valero on the corner of Hwy 6 and Sienna Ranch. As for power, the stores on Hwy 6, at the front of Sienna, and the apartments around the Shell gas station all have power. On Sienna Ranch there was power on one side of the road, spanning from Sienna Springs to Fort Bend Tollway, had power, along with the apartments near Hwy 6.

I saw linemen working near the Shell, as well as the substation on Mount Logan, just after the roundabout.

Small update: there is still a lineman truck at the Mount Logan substation"

"77388 still no power, although its been blue since yesterday. Also areas around our neighborhood are expected to be back up by end of day tomorrow…."
Ah great. This little rain is gonna turn into a 24 hour lunch break for Centercrap.
77096 JUST GOT POWER BACK ON!!
77571 - There was a large tree blocking the only BOULEVARD in and out of our neighborhood. Neighbor just texted the tree is gone and what appeared to be guys starting line work.
"77339 no power, no hope"
"77069 - champions forest & cypresswood area. Mom just got power back!! So happy for her & everyone else getting power back :) 

hoping 77098 gets power back soon 🤞"
[deleted]
77042 - Power just came back. Hold strong friends.
77447- the map is saying energized but no one in my neighborhood has power. What should be done? I know people have said the map is inaccurate but now it is showing estimated dates for restoration. Ours is just saying energized when that is not the case.
New map says we’re energized in 77012 and 77061 but totally dark. I fucking give up.
Bro how tf does everyone outside my neighborhood have power and and just my neighborhood doesn’t complete and utter bull shiiiii
77007 near St Thomas HS. Still no power. Fuckity fuckin dark ages and shit
I’m 90% sure it’s just a transformer that needs replacing. Why is it taking so long?
"77379 - bunch of linemen staged in the parking lot of the Klein ISD therapeutic and readiness center, im near the elementary school here and without power. A tree Batista bombed a pole and took out another across the street."
77008 15th and Columbia just got power. Hope y’all still waiting get help soon.
77054 got power back today. latest map estimated it'll be the 17th. just letting everyone know to disregard what centerpoint puts out.
"Not getting power until Friday wtf man life sucks but aleast there's a date for me, somebody probably already robbed my house already because eveyone left my neighborhood to go somewhere else I'm going to check on it today"
77023. Just got a call from CP my expected restoration time is Friday by end of day. End me please.
"[Here is the update from CenterPoint](https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/releases/Hurricane_Beryl_7.8.24%20PM_Final.pdf)

So this is what it felt like living in Houston pre AC.
taking a sweaty dump as I type this in the dark. FML
"77090 still no power. Nobody cares. Not a single lineman, repair crew or truck. Crickets. 
I honestly think they've forgotten about us and once Centerpointless was done with that 1 million restored on Wednesday they just went back to their usual uncomplicated lives.


This is one very very fucked up city. Houston weak should be the new slogan."
Sorry if this has been shared already but here is a [self-reported outage map](https://digital-client.com/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR1XPyE9cGc23BJzIsNOZLJ6bLDSp2X_iIlt67TOXpR2dhOoCvHJkNU10eE_aem_vEXzpOW63Wfm46k0hNSK1w&mibextid=UyTHkb) that seems to be more accurate than Centerpoint’s
Can we all band together and just not pay Centerpoint this month?
 77095 still out. Hoping for the best th
"https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/


I have no idea if these numbers are just made up, but if accurate there has been steady but very slow progress over the past 6-8 hours."
No pour in 77058 since 4:30am yesterday. It’s been over 24 hours and it’s just gonna get hotter 🥲
77007 near St Thomas High School had power come on for 20 seconds and then it shut off again.  Hopefully it comes back soon.
"77388 which is kuykendahl to i45 in spring, still has no power. The heb and shopping areas have power, but the neighborhoods and apartment complexes are still out."
77070 still without power to my knowledge. I hope we're not part of the multiple days club...
77095 Copper lakes. Centerpoint truck just drove by. They waved at us PLEASEEEEEEEEEE PLEASEEEEEEEE
"Saw two line trucks on the corner of Cullen and Leland, hopefully 77003 and 77023 will be back soon"
Got power back but now xfinity is down suddenly.
Accepted I may not get power till like Friday probably at this point. Anyone have ANY tips to cool down when trying to sleep. I’m all sticky and sweating profusely. My feet are on fire!
"77070


Still no power in my building but several buildings around me have power. At least my complex's office has power so I have somewhere to charge phone and power bank. The animal clinic i work at has power so if anyone needs help with their pet in 77433 area, pm me for the phone number. As far as I know, we're only seeing sick patients since our vaccines had to be thrown out. "
Probably about 10-12 linesman utility trucks at the shopping center at 1960 and breck at in champions area I just saw. Might be working on that area today. 77066 area code btw
77070 still no power and cell service still bad.  Drove around last night and most traffic lights were not working.  Lakewood Forest area.  Kroger on Grant and Louetta had power and was open last night.  The gas stations that were open had no gas or bags of ice as of last night.
77008 - 23rd & East side of Yale got power back about 5 minutes ago.
Anyone around 77025 Southside Place need a food or water run? Happy to deliver something between my meetings today.
"77007 Cottage Grove - just reported a downed line that was pretty hidden away and I think had gone unnoticed until now. Centerpoint said they’d send a crew ASAP, but we’ll see what happens……"
Stafford SW Houston 77477 area POWER UP 7/11/24 about 4AM
77095 just got power! Hope everyone else gets theirs back soon!! I love seeing how united we've been in calling out bs. I really wanna keep this energy going forward bc I keep learning more and more about all this bs affecting us and I don't want to go back to just being clueless
That map isn’t accurate. Updated or not it shows that my work doesn’t have power but im here and it does. Thank god cuz it says my home won’t be restored until 7/14 and I refuse to believe that.
Anyone have an update for 77055 specifically by Kroger? I really don’t get why Kroger and the community center don’t have power. It is a missed opportunity to not give the community center power and make it a cooling center for people.
"77077 Dairy Ashford/Westheimer area in the Energy Corridor. Lost power 530am Monday. I drove 2 hours away to get myself and my baby to a hotel and have no contacts in the area. Have been checking my AT&T smart home manager app to see if my internet modem is back online to check for power. About 20 minutes ago, it was showing my modem back online and was getting good speeds. Then it went back offline about 7 minutes later. Seems like power came back and shut off again unless it had a power surge and quacked out. It is not plugged into a surge protector."
"77389 - just received this message from off-point

FROM: CenterPoint Energy: Crews continue to work around the clock to complete power restorations daily. Based on the status of active restoration work, we estimate your power to be restored by the end of the day, Friday, July 12. Please know restorations will be happening daily and you may be restored earlier.

Edit : now they are saying Saturday"
"77077 - briar forest & Kirkwood, still without power since 7/8 @ 10am"
"77049, still nothing but I'm about to power my whole neighborhood on rage alone."
"77035 Central Westbury just got power back!!! Linemen trucks are all over the place, there is hope!!!"
77008 still without power TC Jester & 11th
77373 Checking in - Still no power in this neighborhood at all.
"77066 - Hollister near Beltway 8/249, 8 AM Friday:

My house in Champions Point Village II is still without power, but the corner store on Bourgeois and Hollister has power as do the traffic lights at that intersection and at Theall & Hollister.

Swanny's at Hollister & Theall is lit up, and the business parks along Theall are all energized.

Give me hope our subdivision will get power today.  I saw a LOT of bucket trucks going north on Hollister."
Back at work in 77008 with no power in a dark and hot warehouse. It's depressing driving through a city in ruins just to work in this shithole building.
"77008 update near high school on 14th - no power yet but crews finally working on removing a large tree sitting on some lines behind a house - really hoping that's been the problem

UPDATE - still no power"
"Jfc... I work from home and just got an alert from IT: ""your computer hasn't backed up in a while and we wanted to check that it's working"" I let them know I'm in the area still without power because of the hurricane and the response was basically ""ok well just ping us when that passes"""
"77386, got power back yesterday afternoon but it just went back out. I'm so done with this..."
"77096, beechnut and south rice just got power back"
77339- Bear Branch. I spoke to a line worker just now and he told me it would be until at least Monday til the power is back. He said it was some of the worst tree damage he had seen.
77379 - Cypresswood and Kuykendall. There's two snapped poles on front of the CVS. One still has part of a tree on it. Haven't seen any trucks come around yet.
We got power back on at 6:30 only for it to go out 20min later. 77088 zip code. New map says we’re energized. Also looks like some folks won’t be getting it back till Tuesday or later of next week. This is insane
77086 - new map says restoration pending review. If we're after the 19th me and my mom will for sure be dead by then
"Love being surrounded by dates and my building still rocks the ""Further review"" tag. Thank you Centerpoint. Really cool really chill. Love it."
[deleted]
WHY IS MY ETA THE 17TH
"77489. Power just came back. Was given no estimated time yesterday. And on today’s update was given until the EOD 17th. So I guess the map is kind of useless.


I did end up flagging down a CenterPoint lineman and asked what was being worked on near me and when I could get power back. He mentioned a tree was tangled on the line and that, that alone would make power return - unless something else major happened that hasn’t been discovered.


I will say, that we lost power at 2AM when Beryl made landfall and never even got a taste of electricity until today. I hope everyone else without it gets it soon, and if anyone needs assistance with anything hmu."
77459 Lake Olympia (or at least our part of it) has power again!! Just came back up about an hour ago and CP had sent us a text message that it would be back up by tomorrow. A day sooner than expected.
"77586 - Seabrook/El Lago.  Finally powered up after 6 long, miserable days.  During the final hookup this afternoon, the line to my complex needed a new switch because the one up there couldn't hold the voltage needed and the supervisor said it may not be tonight.  My heart sank, but luckily they were able to install one shortly after and we are in good shape.  My wife and our dog are at the hotel while I clean up the apartment, make sure everything works and spend some quality time with our cats who are currently fighting over who gets my lap. 

I hope those of you still without power are alright and you get restored soon.  I've been through Allison, Ike and Harvey prior.  Lost my apartment during Harvey.  This was still the worst one I've been through up to this point.  This sucked."
"Nested outages are fucked, I guess. We’re the only block in our neighborhood with no power (77084). Hit 0 when calling to talk to a human who told us our status was “waiting for crew assignment” before pausing and saying “so probably not today”. It’s a blown transformer with literally nothing around it. No damage. Just fucked. And the map won’t even give us a date because we’re “energized”."
"77373. Spring. The map shows us to be energized but no power here. The drone of the generators is still ongoing.


I cut the mains on and left all the other breakers off save on - the one that sends power to the back porch lights.


There are several bucket trucks driving around here right now. Fingers crossed!"
77007 power back at 11am this morning.
"77086 - got power back yesterday evening, slept 12 hours immediately"
77018 relief has never felt this good. Fingers crossed it stays!
Is there any way to find out an ETA from Center Point? We need to decide soon if we need to leave or stick it out. This is crazy. We’ve been without power for 38 hours.
"When you all can, start saving money so you can leave Texas. This will only get worse."
Just heard lightening. Everyone’s about to lose power again.
Rumor is that centerpoint has hundreds of trucks not yet deployed as it negotiates their pay.
77578 just got power
Out now for over 12 hours in 77098
77379 down since 6:45 am. Just enjoying the sound of all our neighbors generators
Nada in 77054
"https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/

centerpoint outage tracker
my neighborhood(77081) lost power like 4am, when Beryl got cause I randomly woke up at 5 and there was no power"
"77494 (on the very edge/inner-99 side): 2 streets in our neighborhood has power, but we do not. Traffic lights out at 99/westheimer but fully functional at westheimer/peek. 

We had centerpoint roll through our neighborhood 4 hours ago and then…. nothing for us."
77063 no power or water since 6am
"77041, West rd and 290, power restored 10:45."
"77069 - power has been out since 9 am. We have a generator running (I’m sharing it with my neighbors) but it’s hell without AC.  
Tomorrow I’ll decide if I’ll head to Austin"
77024 lost power around 6am still nothing
"77469 still no power since 6am and service has been spotty as hell, I've only been able to get so much as a Google search off maybe twice all day. Verizon."
Hopefully it’s back before it gets too much warmer 
"77084 one half of the apartment complex has power, the other doesn't... We on the side without it..."
"77023 still the only one without power on my street


Edit: it appears an air bnb behind my house is also without power. They are also sandwiched by folks with electricity"
"Friendswood, 77546. Haven’t had power since 7 AM Monday. I’m fucking miserable, attempting to sleep in my car. We’ll see if I run out of gas 🤷🏻‍♂️ drove around for 4 hours going to hotels / motels I thought were open or had a room but all were closed or had no power."
"GOOF area, lost power for a week in april, had to toss out everything in the fridge, ground hogs day all over again."
77038 no power still and I haven’t slept at all. It’s sooooo hot
77450 fort bend and i havent had power for over 27 hours. this is ridiculous
"77009, still no power as of now, going on 24 hours without.

Have not seen a single CenterPoint truck (or any other line crews) between the Heights and Katy."
77096 Still no power
77008. Just saw a bunch of centerpoint trucks drive by the hotel im at into the neighborhood. Hopefully a good sign.
"77090 no power since 8 am yesterday. Drove along 1960 from Kuykendahl to 45 yesterday afternoon, no traffic lights and no power anywhere. Found one Honduran restaurant open, waiting time was 45 minutes. Have not seen a single repair crew, truck, utility. Frustration is building up. 


77073 where I work does not have either power or water."
77389- spring/gosling area still no power
Got an email from Centerpoint about 2 hrs ago saying crews are in the area for my address. I was sleeping so just saw this. 77040 around Hollister St on the East side of 290. I'll go drive around and see if that's hogwash like it probably is. Though I am hopeful since we were one of the last to get power in May.
"After 30 hours, my part of 77083 has power"
Got power back just now - West U.
77008. Drove by the house and around Yale/Heights. No power N of 11th E of Yale. Didnt see any crews but given the wide area out they might be working at the source. On the plus side didnt see much evidence of widespread damage to poles and lines.
"77045 still no power in the residential areas, but there is power on parts of West Orem and West Fuqua. I saw a few gas stations up and running. 

Saw one Centerpoint truck during my tour of the neighborhood. It didn't appear to be doing anything. I guess they were still assessing damage and/or waiting for instructions."
"temp check, what're y'alls thermostats reading at? I'm at 80 downstairs, 82 upstairs with 75% humidity. My swamp cooler has run out of ice. Rip"
Power is back on 77006!!! Milam St and Lousiana St
77054 - Holly Hall Street power out still
I feel like if you are on the same grid as businesses you will get power today..if not good luck.
77077 - still no power since 10am yesterday
"77494 (right on the border of 77450 off westheimer)  — POWER BACK after 36 hours! House up to 85 degrees and hoping the power remains on. 

I had neighbors across the street that had their power restored 24 hours ago, so it’s been hell watching them love totally normal, non-inconvenienced lives the past day."
77070 still without power. Waaaay too hot for this
77007. Anyone near Jackson hill and Feagan? Do you guys have power? Update me if you guys get it!
"77043 west of Gessner near Spring Woods High school, no power. 
Office manager at my work just texted me power is on at work: 77092 near Mitchelldale and 43rd

Memorial City Mall is open and SLAMMED. Food
 court open but Starbucks closed .  I went to get a car charger for my phone and some food, people were charging their devices from the floor outlets.
Traffic lights are out at Gessner and I 10 and it is an accident waiting to happen. Take Bunker Hill exit the lights are working there then turn on Gaylord or Barryknoll to get to the mall.
There is a tree down blocking 1 lane on Longpoint heading east from Gessner toward Bunker hill, but the other eastbound lane is clear to get past it and the west lanes are ok. 
Valero Station on Gessner and Hammerly is open, I think the Kroger is open but not 100% on that."
"Lots of posts about 77096 back up, but I still don't have power :("
77069 is now at 36 hours without power.
"About two hours ago, I got an alert from Centerpoint saying that ""Repair crews are assessing the power issue at or near [MY EXACT ADDRESS].""

Has anyone else gotten that email and subsequently gotten their power restored?"
"My entire neighborhood has power except for 12 houses on one block.  Guess where I live? 

Why has thou forsaken me?"
"Westheimer and Fondren 

77063 

Still no power since 7am Monday."
"77518. Still no power. 

Keep getting notifications every hour or so from Centerpoint that the power to my house has been restored. Leave work, drive to house, reset circuit breaker: no power. Re-report outage.

So freaking tired of this shit."
Any update 77070?
"77008 E 26th and Harvard just got a notification from centerpoint that power is back but I’m out of town, can anyone near there confirm?"
[deleted]
"I am looking to change my apartment next month. Someone, please let me know where they fixed the electricity on the first day :p"
"77035 Central Westbury. I’ve already resigned myself to not having power until next Monday, I think we will be very lucky to get it back by the end of this week. "
77018 near N Sheperd and Pinemont still no power
"77006 near Rudyards - POWER BACK, internet (x-finity) working"
"Updates seemed to have dried up, giving up hope of getting power tonight... 77011 by Lockwood and navigation"
"Still no power for 77088, off 249 neighborhood is completely dark for 3rd night"
"77092 everyone near us seems to have power, but my appartment doesn't. The street lights are on right up until my appartment complex then turn back on again after us"
"77469 Richmond-Rosenberg, Our 3rd night without power. Fuck CenterPoint HQ, and the PUC/ERCOT"
77096: Power is back as of about 20 minutes ago. W. Belfort and Willowbend. My mom is across Chimney Rock near Belfort and still is out.
"Hey, /u/eepy_neebies_seepies  THANKS for your post!

You should add a note near the top that CenterPoint's outage map now shows estimated restoral, but you have to zoom in on your area and then left-click your mouse to have the estimate show up.

When I click on my area it doesn't give an estimate, but a mile north of us where my office is, it says by the end of the day July 13th.

Edit/Update:  Got a text and an email from CenterPoint at 1:35 PM today (Thursday) saying estimated restoral for us is by end-of-day Saturday 7/13, but could be sooner.  

Well, I hope it's sooner.  Propane is about $85 a day."
77070 lakewood FINALLY has power back. Wishing the best for those of you still left behind
77096: power now back around Chimney Rock and W. Belfort!!!
"77090 the map says end of day July 13, but my particular address has the note of “continue to provide restoration estimations as they become available.”  Quickly losing the little hope I had building today with that. Still not messages from them. "
"77088 - Inwood North, entire subdivision has power except my side of the street and the houses behind us. Then to add insult to injury, centerpoint sends me an email saying power had been restored to my home. Absolutely absurd."
"77571 - Still no power, but I did have my first cup of coffee since Sunday. Which turned into me drinking the whole pot fuck you caffeine withdrawal headaches."
77030 with no power. Told from apartment complex to not expect power for multiple more days.
"Another contribution to “the map is wrong” —

Checked the map just now and still has my address as blue/assessment complete. I have had power since Tuesday afternoon… my neighbors who have had power since Monday afternoon also are showing as blue. 

Also saw about 5-6 contracted centerpoint trucks posted up at the Target off Westheimer and 99 (Katy) this morning around 8:30AM."
"77077 - Briargreen Village - still no power for days. According to the new map, neighbors east of Briargreen drive are partially energized while my side remains in the blue. 


This is truly absurd. I remember losing power to Ike and winter storm Uri but those didn't last long; I never lost power to Harvey, Nicholas, or even the May derecho. Being in a hot, humid and dark house this many days is not fun whatsoever. 


I'm also sick and tired of the noises coming from the compressors my neighbors have been running 24/7. I can't even step outside for some fresh air or open my doors without getting slammed by their pollution. I'll be so happy when the power's back."
77063 I think I have officially lost hope. I really can’t believe a category 1 shut the city down for this long. 
If you are looking for a hotel room I managed to book one in college station that’s pet friendly. If anyone has updates about 77077 please let me know
77092 power is finally back but it's storming so I'm nervous (we're having momentary flickers) to get too excited 😭🙌🏽 I've felt hopeful seeing so many linemen in the area around the Clifton Middle School area since around 9am so I'm praying everyone in the area can get their power back asap!! 
"77571 - Walked down to verify second hand information about crews in the area. Confirmed 2 bucket trucks and guys actively working.

Centerpoint map shows only assessment done, not work. It seems the heroes on the ground maybe working faster than that busted map."
77064 jones and west. No power. Tired of this shit
77042 power is back!
77090 Cypress Station area is back as of about 10ish minutes ago
"77077 near Hwy 6 and Memorial. Came back on in the last few hours while a section 6 doors down never lost power. We were in the same “assessment complete” section as a bunch of lights on Hwy 6 so I was hoping for a quicker response, alas. And no updates from Centerpoint despite already being enrolled in their alerts prior to this storm. Off to shop for a guillotine for their executives, or maybe just a standby home generator. Gonna try to get quotes from several vendors and hopefully not get gouged too bad."
"Map is green, but still no power since Mon 5:45 AM."
"77074 next to Jane Long high, we still have no power, but the map shows the whole area as energized. We don't even have an update from CenterPoint, almost as if they don't give a fuck."
"77027, near Central Market. There has been no power since the storm hit. There is no estimated date for when they will repair the issues. At the very least, let us know how long it will take to get the power back on so we can prepare accordingly.  Centerpoint Energy is a disgrace of a company. I don't expect them to take any blame (though they should), but they need to communicate!!!"
"77025 : finally after 122 hours, we have the power."
77090 .. Finally electricity is back ..
Just checked the map after we got off the phone with center point. My area won't have power again until the 17th and judging by how accurate the map is so far that's if we are lucky. This is just ridiculous I have things due that have already been pushed back.
[deleted]
"77028… showing no eta on the map and everywhere around the neighborhood where rosewood park is has power. Who decided I’m last? Thank you for making me spend so much money and suffer for, according to their map, will be over 14 days? Come on…."
"77004, near Dennis and chenevert, no power still in this nested outage. Centerpoint map said would be fixed Friday, then yesterday, then today. Called them earlier and they said tomorrow. Idk how much longer this is really gonna go"
77007 w 6th got power!
77024 We got ours today!!! so happy!! pray of those that do not have theirs!
"I almost forgot to give an update, my apartment complex on Ella 77090 has power back on finally"
77004 power just came back. Hopefully stays on.
Why have two pinned threads for this?
"Can we not just have 1 megathread for power updates? Whatever the purpose of the other thread is, it all just devolves into power updates lmao"
"I've come to terms that for at least ~50% of us, we're in this for the long haul. The uncertainty in the forecast track and intensity lulled Centerpoint into complacency to not have staged out of state teams. It's going to be a week or more to restore power for that other 50% of us. 

Anyone who works in a hospital or government is saying the same thing about their contingency operations. Nobody wants to interrupt business until it's too late, or be called a fear monger for raising the alarm over a little tropical storm in the Gulf that, for awhile, seemed like it was tracking well south of us."
"77090 and 77073, still no power, just got a lovely text from centerpoint stating:


Blahblahblah we are working hard
Blahblahblah we care
Blahblahblah we are the champions
Oh, and prepare to be without power for days. 
Cheers"
"Got power about an hour ago on Lawrence between 8th and 11th Street in the Heights.  I have to say that given we went through a hurricane, getting power back after only one hot night is not too bad."
"I feel that it is ridiculous how Centerpoint hasn't improved with how they deal with this kind of crisis. 
I know me personally. This is at least the 3rd time I've experienced this exact situation. 
Rita, Ike, now Beryl. 
I'm pretty sure there's another hurricane I'm forgetting the name of where power was out for at least 2 days. 
The freeze we lost power for 3, maybe 4 days. 

What I'm saying is after 2 situations like this I would think Centerpoint could have learned from those 2 incidents and improved the way to handle it. Leaving the system they are taking responsibility for down for so long is not acceptable in my opinion.
If they are taking responsibility for this whole state why wouldn't they stay prepared and equipped to have it repaired after its taken down without the people who pay to use it having to go without for more than a day. 

If this is just impossible due to the way the system or grid is designed, then we need to design a better grid system period.

As a society, we like to think that we are more advanced than we where 10 years back. We aren't if this happened 10 years ago, and we are in that same predicament again. 

As a country, we send billions to other countries so they can do whatever it is they do with it.
 Why can't we use it to design a grid system that can be replaced within a day if the whole thing is taken out?
 If that's beyond the capability of out tech then it's time we take the smartest people we have in that area of study and find a design that doesn't ever let a category 1 hurricane cripple us like this again."
"77090 has a lot of people in sick, elderly in DIRE need.  No traffic lights. Shame on you, Centerpoint!"
Have they done anything at all? This is so fucking ridiculous. It is way too hot for them to be playing around and not giving us updates by location so we can plan.
[deleted]
I just want to say I truly feel bad for all yall still without power. this is insane
"Centerpoint isn’t giving any particular neighborhood by neighborhood updates but they’ve restored about 200,000 customers of 2.5 million at last check. Neighborhoods to the south are seemingly being restored the quickest given the storm impacted and moved out of those areas earlier in the day for their crews to get started."
"My parents and I both live in 77096, in the same apartment complex. They have power and I don't."
"The transmission-line insider guy added another update to his comment, tonight: https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1dyp4m9/power_outage_updates/lcik1fn/

> UPDATE3: 2140 on 7/10:

> * lines from Addicks to WP/BW8 to Bellaire returned to service

> * major breaker in south Pasadena returned to service

> * the crosstown work may have hit snags with the middle section that traverses the Heights still scheduled for outage ending 7/10 2200 so that work is likely to be moved to tomorrow. This includes a major xfmr at 610/290 that is scheduled to come back 7/13 1700

>Points to remember:

> * major lines feed the smaller lines. This is all information about major lines, not the lines that go to your house or even feed your neighborhood. These are big big lines that are the backbone of the system.

> * lines going out of service is normal, particularly when things need to be de-energized to fix them. Most of the time de-energizations happen and you never even know it because other lines handle the change but right now it's very possible to gain power and then lose it again. I know that it incredibly frustrating, but it's really the only way.

> * most work is likely moving to the distribution network where visibility drops. Currently it looks like they plan to wrap up major work by end of Saturday although that may easily move.

> * likely outages will be updated and new plans come out overnight from the work this evening."
Let’s go riot. I see no other option.
I lost power in 77034 and nothing yet.  Some down power lines
77044 just turned back on.
77008. Down since 6:30am. No sign of Centerpoint at all out here.
"77477 , still no power, though some buildings in my complex did get power back."
77477 whole neighborhood is pitch black. Except for all the neighbors chilling in their cars on driveways just to charge their phones lol (myself included)
"77016 Scenic Woods. Lost power 9:15am. Not a flicker since. Took a drive through the area around sunset. The Mi Tienda on 59 and Little York was open and packed. Everything else, except for a packed Valero on Little York was closed. Fiesta looked like they had power, and so did Home Depot (I know they have generators), but they were both closed. Only other stuff I saw with any real power was some light industry that surely has their own generators."
"77063 Tanglewilde/Ella Lee ln no power still. Neighbors on Guessner, Briar Forest dr and Westerland Dr got power. Centre point website says our meter is powered and online, not sure if they know that it's really NOT bc they don't accept electricity related calls today 😞"
77546 lost power at 5:00 a.m. four houses away from me got their power back at 5:00 p.m. not me though.
"Pessimistic news for those in 77024. Don’t expect power till at best tomorrow. According to email from piney point mayor, centerpoint has just assessed the damage today and work will begin tomorrow."
"77057, 77494, and 77035 all out since this morning and still nothing."
77023. No power since 8/9am.
Is there a way to sign up for center point energy text updates without using the website ? I can’t get the page to load
77034.  No power.   If this post goes through than cell towers might be working.
77011 just woke up after 'sleeping' partial power no water
77573 not necessarily in Houston I’m in league city but TNMP outage map says they are re evaluating for about 12+ hours and Main Street has power we are a block away and we don’t what gives
77406 (Pecan Grove) - No power still been out since Monday at 5:30 am.
I live right off I10 and gessnar. Every Business around me has power but my complex. Even after the last storm they lost it. This one nope just my complex. This is bullshit
"77019, 4th ward. Townhouses across the street from mine never lost power. Apartment complex I can see from my home (on grey) has power, I can see tvs. But nothing for the block I'm on apparently.


Gonna have to go somewhere with the animals today, can't stay when it's gonna hit the 90s. :-( even my parents out in bfe are without. "
77571 - just got power back. Had been off since ~6 am yesterday. Still no internet (Xfinity)
77054 still no power
Has anyone else got pussy footed? It’s happened twice so far the lights turned on then instantly turned off. Wtf does that mean? Both times happened 12 hours between eachother and the most recent one was 5 hours ago.
"77006 (near Montrose) power now on - thanks to the power crew working overtime

There are many trees down in area despite storm being ""only a Cat 1"". It's going to be a process to get them cleared from utility right of ways"
77004 museum district - Got power back at about 1030am. Across the street had power last night.
77076 still no power
"77536, lots of places with power now.

I have the dubious joy of having had the pole transformer blow about 30 minutes before the neighborhood, so many streets now have power - - except 4 of us.

I suspect that I'm gonna be waiting a few days."
"We’re out. And been out since Monday morning at 3AM. 77354 here and no where in sight has power. I drive to Conroe every day for work and even there they’re out of power. I got a child, dementia grandfather and wife at home with no food or running water"
77009 by north main. Power back on.
"Is anybody receiving power alerts from CenterPoint? I normally get them, but this time I am getting nothing. Half of our apartment complex has power, but my half doesn't. When I log in it says ""Status: Power Off"", but I've not received any emails or texts acknowledging our outage, despite being signed up for alerts."
Any update on 77070 (249/cypresswood dr area)? Haven’t seen any centerpoint trucks.
"My Mom in 77065 has power, but my brother in 77064 does not. I'm in 77069 still without power."
77019 power up 45 and Dallas
"Does this message from CenterPoint mean anything?

Repair crews are assessing the power issue at or near 77005. We will update you with additional information about the status of these repairs as it becomes available. We appreciate your patience as we work to complete our repairs as quickly and safely as possible."
"77004, around Binz and Calumet - Power came back around 5:30PM. Hopefully it keeps, I was starting to get a little loopy."
Anyone in 77070? I live close to Spring Cypress/249.
Just saw some linesman in EaDo at McKinney/Sampson
"77081 Marquis on Pin Oak back up!!
First year Houstonian….that fuckin sucked"
Any update as of 77070?
"A lot of Westbury got power about an hour ago, but as other reported Comcast dropped soon after. Whatever, my house was 80F and 72% humidity, I will take even a couple hours of power to get the humidity down."
"77070 still no power and i think were gonna be last like always 😞 its so hot and i have alot of elderly neighbors, this is horrible!! "

Half my street has power but the other half me included doesn’t  they come by yesterday and didn’t fix it they never came back:/
"77095 Southcreek still no power, out since 4 AM Monday.  Down the street they have lights but I'm part of a big long stretch that doesn't. I hope, hope, hope we are on the list for today. 🤞🤞🤞"
"I’ve posted a few times about my area here (77004, Venue Museum District apartments at Fannin and Oakdale). But we got power back around 10:30 pm last night, and the map still showed our address in orange as of this morning. My Centerpoint account DID update, however, to show that my meter was on once it was restored."
77530 just got power back
77095 Copper Lakes power just came back!!!
"77054, no power since Monday am. Every single other house in my neighborhood has power. Can someone explain how this is possible? Is my house somehow the only one connected to a different power line?"
77045 neighbors across the street got their power back. We never lost our power (we did last time) and the ATT internets still out

"Anyone know the status of 77008, near TC Jester and 11th? It sounds like power around the area is starting to come back. Currently working at a friend's house in Rosenberg and have not had a chance to go out to check."
77006 by comm and Vermont back in biz
77057 San Felipe/Fountain View area. We have power.  Centerpoint outage map is inaccurate
77377 just got power. Thank heavens. Good luck people. We were in the orange too. Fuck that map
Power back on 77007 near TC Jester and I-10!
"I’m in 77069 and I don’t see no light truck. This some bs

Update: the power came back on"
"77007 - neighborhood near Jackson Hill & Washington still no power, but it looks like everyone around us has power 🫠"
"77066 - Thursday 7:17 AM - No power at our house, nearby businesses and traffic lights.  

I did see three utility bucket trucks northbound on Hollister heading toward 1960, and those were the first I've seen in this area.  Have to see that as a good sign."
77373 still nothing. Still haven’t seen a truck. No poles/lines down or trees down in the general area. My new hobby is sitting in the gas station parking lot and watching people not understand how to do a 4 way stop.
They meant noon Pacific Team obviously
"Frustrated with the lack of info for my area (and in general). If we don’t have an estimated restoration date yet, is it safe to assume we won’t have power by the end of the weekend?

Info would be helpful in figuring out next steps, but when has centerpoint done anything helpful?"
Still no estimate for the Gessner and Kemp Forest area... or much of Spring Branch at all.
"77096, the neighborhood behind Parker elementary has power (Willowbend and Atwell). Centerpoint is still reporting my power as off but a a neighbor said it was off and on for an hour, but now staying on. Will be driving over in a few to confirm if I can go home 🤞🏾🙏🏾"
77498 west Bellfort and hw6 is back
77407 Aliana has power again
77063 westheimer/south gessner still nothing. Shows green on the map but no power. Staying positive 🤘🏼
Waste management and disposal service skipped twice this week. Garbage bags are accumulating on the sidewalk. The situation is getting worse.
I would love to here more news about 77077. Ran from our apartment to a family friend that has power but you can only stay so long without feeling like intruding. My mom is at the end of her rope at the thought of this outage lasting any longer.

"Still no power In my block. 77029 One side of the neighbors have power and the other side (includes me) none. Last time I check it was blue, then back to green which means energized. Ugh not even an estimate day on restoration.

 Update: my power came back. I”ll pray to all father that power gets back to all other parts of Houston today as well. "
77090 power back on finally 😩
"77004, midtown, Dennis and chenevert, still no power. According to the dumb map we should’ve had it fixed EOD yesterday but it seems like there’s still nested outages. No ETA as of right now"
"new map. july 16 for me. 


at least there’s a date now."
"77034 - Gulf Palms - Power back up at around 14:50 local time (2pm, almost 3pm)

I know many brothers and sisters in this thread and the other main daily are still out, but thankfully this time. I am done for now."

"77057 Woodway and Voss we are BACK ONLINE! I could not be more relieved, finally!!"
77040 off west gulf bank road has power! 🎉🙏🏾
"77023 no power. I think that the last folks to get their power restored should have a block party style celebration with news coverage, a marching band and prizes from local businesses. lol."
"77066 - Monday 7/15 - Still out, and the map says by end of day Wednesday, still.

I think a big part of the problem, right in the middle of the purple section on our map, is [this pole that's down](https://i.imgur.com/Nj67JQP.jpg) near the Tim Horton's at Richie and Bammel N. Houston.

I have to go to work today and leave the house on generator power, but sure hope someone sees them starting to do some work on this pole today.  It's not a simple one because there are underground conduit runs involved, but it'll obviously have to be fixed before a lot of us get power back."
77373 Cypresswood near Kroger. Monday day 8 out of power.
"77066 - Champions Village II - Power restored just before 3:30 this afternoon (Monday).

Delighted to be able to shut off that generator and give it a rest."
77055 - Hammerly and Johanna just got power back!
"77008 N of 24th - POWER BACK ON 2:50 PM

Spoke to the linemen - when they tried to re-energize the circuit yesterday, the inrush amperage from everyone's AC kicking on at the same time melted one of the power lines into another, causing a short and blowing a big fuse (the grenade we heard over here).

They replaced the lines and the fuse, and we should be stable!"
"77004 Museum District just LOST power again.
Edit: Update, power is back. They had to turn it off in order to repair a local power line apparently."
"77095, still no power in my area. Sleeping downstairs on the couch, but my 80lb dog decided it’s a good idea to sleep on my legs tonight 🙃"
"So um about that tracker...
Is it in the room with us along with the power?"
"I hope as long as its taking they truly are FIXING the problem, not putting tape over it."
"Still no power in my Alief neighborhood. Two million people without power, is that some kind of record? And for this weak ass storm?


 For the first time, a couple of my neighbors seem to have acquired generators. While I'm proud of them for staying on top of things, I didn't realize how incredibly loud they are. Can't imagine what it will sound like after everyone gets one we will inevitably need to do."
77004. Got power back at 1 pm.
"77025 power is back for me. I can take in anyone’s dog or small animal tomorrow who needs it (I have pet rats so I can’t take any cats, I’m sorry).

Thank you, linemen. CenterPoint and Texas reps: eat shit!"
Centerpoint just sent a text saying they are working on clearing debris and vegetation to make repairs. They are saying to be prepared to not have power for several days. Thing is...there is no damaged lines or debris/vegetation around 77040 for miles!
"77498 still no power, I’m pregnant and this heat is…not comfortable. 

Our neighborhood has been on “Assessment in progress” on Centerpoint’s bullshit map since it was released. Just now my husband and I spotted a lineman truck in our neighborhood, so we chased it down and asked if they were fixing things in our neighborhood. Nope - they were just now doing the initial patrol of our area to spot/identify issues. Then they’d have to go report back to their superiors, who presumably would take the info and put us in line for some assistance sometime in the future. The linemen in the truck had no idea when they or anyone would be sent out to actually do any repairs. 

The best part is I checked the status map right after that conversation and the fucking liars at Centerpoint (not blaming the linemen at all) had updated our area to “assessment complete.” They barely STARTED this morning and said the patrol of their assigned area might take a day or two. Centerpoint is absolutely cooking the books to make it seem like they have done way more than they have and repairs are progressing much faster than they actually are. 

This shit makes me so angry and there’s nothing, absolutely nothing we can do about it as long as our corrupt and complicit state government (who I already vote against in every election) co-signs this abysmal treatment of their citizens."
77007 Jackson Hill & Feagan has power!!
77091-(Pinemont Plaza-near Tidwell and TCJ) power restored. It was off from 5am Monday to 5pm Friday. Thank you Linemen and fuck you Centerpoint!

[deleted]
77025. Out since 5 am still.
77007 next to St Thomas High School and still no power.  It took 3 days to get power to this area during the derecho.  I feel like the damage from the hurricane was not as extensive so hoping we get it back sooner.
"We have a downed line. I'm trying to call an EMERGENCY, but I can't get through!!!"
"77062, no power still, my poor pets started overheating so we sat in my car for ac :("
"SOS I’m new to generators — how do I safely power down my generator? I know unplug everything but should I kill the gas switch first and let it shut down or flip the off switch? 

I have the 3500w craftman from Lowe’s."
77007 near Cleveland Park still no power.

"77098 no power. See generators along the sidewalk, not sure but maybe that is what is powering a couple nearby complexes I see with lights on. Also lights on at Lamar high school pkg garage."

77011 off wayside n canal  just turned back on!!!
Does anyone in 77008 have power?  Don’t even see crews out
Has anyone gotten power back and then lost it again? Trying to figure out how stable this state of restoration is!
77006 back on
My center point account just changed from power off to power on but I clearly don’t have power — what does that mean? Working its way?

"77494 just came back online as did 77035 and 77057 earlier.  All partial obviously. 

Also, if you haven't got a poweralert notification about your house yet, don't be discouraged. I only got prior notice they were working on one of them. The other two just came on without notice."
77095 power on. Thank you Jesus

Center point told someone in our complex to expect several days... At 77021
77072 the entire shopping center where the HEB is at Beltway 8 and Beechnut is has power. The Whataburger drive thru only is open. The Boba and Wok Express are open. But still no power past that on Beechnut to (?) although I believe someone said there is power further down around Kirkwood or Dairy Ashford iirc
"77098 Montrose - power came back on around 4 or 5 PM I think. 

I was staying with a friend in Katy and made the mistake of waiting to get gas. Don't wait. I had to go to four gas stations to get gas and my empty light was on. One station ran out right as I pulled up to the pump. I finally got gas at the Kroger on Voss.

Edit: some hotels are still available in Katy and my coworkers were able to get hotel rooms near the galleria"
77008 Beverly and 13th whole neighborhood is out 😔

"
No power yet 77077 near 6 and Westheimer

Update 7p still nope

Update Thurs just after midnight still nope"
Does anyone know a timeline of the different steps centerpoint takes? As in when they will start on the neighborhood level outages and so on
Just came back to power in my apartment building again 😭 they also removed the fallen tree in the front  (77019 - across from Piggy’s bar) hope that means other buildings on my block also got power back! 
"Just stopped by 77096 about 30 minutes ago. Didn’t see any homes with visible lights driving down Hillcroft from US 90. The whole neighborhood between Willowbend/Hillcroft and W Bellfort/Chimney Rock seemed to be out. While leaving, I saw some traffic lights that were dead last night back on again, on/near Chimney Rock and US 90. Don’t know if that means anything."
"77584 had power for a few flickers then cut out again. Email from Centerpoint saying the issue is resolved and thanks for being a customer lol. No power to anything on my block, went ahead and rereported it I guess."
"77070 - NW cypresswood area, fm1960- finally got power here, we saw many trucks now going down 1960, good luck neighbors"
77015 Email from Centerpoint just now saying they are working on getting me an estimate of which date my power will be restored

"> work on a major crosstown 138kV line through the Heights to Crosby is going out this evening (1630) and expected back at 2200. This is likely to go out or may already be out, hopefully come back later tonight.

This is from the Ercot guy from earlier. I live between the Heights and Crosby in the Sheldon area, could someone smarter than me tell me what this means for power between the two places? My power never came back aside from a brief 5 minute period yesterday, could this possibly mean that we'll get ours back tonight?"
[deleted]
Anyone know about what's going on in magnolia (77354)? Still no power since 5am Monday but there's a bunch of Centerpoint trucks out here off of Egypt. Trying to see if we should have any hope lol

[deleted]
"Does it show ""Power is on"" under yalls Centerpoint account as soon as the power is back at your house?"
77019 - La Rue street near W. Dallas & Waugh. Still no power. We have been a highlighted blue section of the map for the past 24 hours or so but still nothing. a neighbor told me we won’t get restored until SUNDAY?! Not sure how well informed they are. I pray they are wrong as hell tho 
77057 near San Felipe/Fountain View power just came back on 😭
"77571 - No power, but the antique bike path lights have power so that's good. Bicycle safety is no joke."
"[https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/about-us/news/1779](https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/about-us/news/1779)

  
Does anyone have access to the most recent update from the centerpoint site where they report the number of outages/restored? When I went to open the one they released at 8am today, it keeps opening to a blank page...."
77069- left two hours ago and there was still no power for those wondering.
77494 Seven Meadows section 19 (northeast of Fry/Katy-Gaston) got power back at 1 a.m. Xfinity appears to be working as well. Im not sure if the whole neighborhood is back up though.

Power still out 77096. Any update?
"CNP map now has dates - for my neighborhood in 77345 (Kingwood), I have “end of day, July 12”. Yay, tomorrow! Could be BS but I’m hopeful!"
How are you guys checking estimates? Any updates on 77459 Missouri City?
77063 showing green on the map as of late but unfortunately we don’t have power here. I’m sure this nasty storm will cause delay. I bet CenterPoint didn’t know a storm was coming today 😅🙄😩
"I guess this storm is gonna cause some further delays, understandably. 
Saw that there is no ETA for my area, at this rate I hope it’s before Sunday"
77450- AT&T internet back on as of 2PM
"77571 - Letter from mayor says power by weekend longshot most likely mid week.

The truck stop and all the businesses across the highway from me are powered."
Does anyone have an update on 77373? North Spring?
"77379 - 99 and champion forest drive area… power appears to be back up.

Not at location, but all my devices just popped up online and got notifications on my phone."
77070 near millridge still no power 😭 it’s going to be 4th day if it’s not back on tonight! I just can’t anymore 😩

77044 bw8/tidwell We just got power back on

77407 got power back 24 hours ago. Lost it again just now.
[deleted]

[deleted]
"77064 - Between 1960 and Beltway 8. Brother’s House got power back at 7. Power briefly went back out, but has remained on since 8 pm."
[deleted]
"Still in our non-electrified bubble in 77006. Tried calling Centerpoint and they are at least aware of the outage. No estimate of course. 

I was in New Orleans as a teenager when Katrina hit. I never thought I’d have to relive a mini version of that in Houston and from a Cat 1."
Has anyone in the partially energized zone gotten an ETA? I only see blue areas with ETAs and I’m wondering if they’ll do us last.
[deleted]
77098- actually losing hope
"77379 - Got back power yesterday around 5PM, lost power around 11:30 am until 12:30 pm today - now have power + internet. Considering my blessings."

"77459 - Just got it back an hour ago, unsure if it’s my Xfinity router or the coaxial outlet, but the router isn’t turning on at all to even indicate no internet with the orange light."
Saw 3 CP trucks on San Jacinto and Cleburne
77077 - briar forest & Kirkwood - got power back about an hour ago
"77571 - Bucket trucks all took off at 6pm. Another night tending the generator. But that's ok, I am grateful for having it."
77007 mid-Jackson Hill. Power is back up as of a few hours ago!
Do they actually work overnight as well? Anybody got power back in the middle of the night? The new map is absolute trash. Marked as energized when the whole neighborhood is still without power.
"77090 says i should have had power yesterday.. still no power in my apts or any businesses or lights on my street for that matter, stop fwm centerpoint just be honest about when my shits coming back on i have roaches trying to move in its so muggy in my apt."
77008 near TC Jester. Still no power but I saw a ton of bucket trucks out by Eureka rail yard this morning. So maybe there’s hope
77571- We back baby! Fingers crossed it stays that way!
My generator just went out for good like 30 minutes ago. I am screwed at this point. No sign of trucks anywhere.
"77388 FM 2920/Bridgestone Ln

Power came on for 2 seconds and hasn't come back since."
[deleted]
"77379, Spring Cypress/Champions forest, we just got power back. Out since Monday morning, even though we’ve been listed as energized since two days ago."
"77006, Fairview & Waugh. Finally got an estimate for restoration. EOD next Tuesday. 

I’m fucking floored it’s taking this long. But at least we got news?"
77008 near 11th and TC Jester - power is back
13th street lit up!!! 😊 ⛮ 🚦 
Finally after long days our power is up! Mist ln apartment 77070 😊 thank you lord! 🙏
finally. 77489 is back. bless you all who are still putting up with centerpointless’ bullshit. hoping you all get it soon
77380 no power but restoration map says today. Have 0 faith in that tho
"The map said my area by 288/dennis/McGowen was suppose to be fixed Friday, then yesterday, and today there is still no power. 

I really want this shit to end"
"77066 - Champions Point Village - Hollister/Bourgeois - Day 7 without power.  Also, Xfinity cable has been out the whole time too.

Logging into their website and phone app, it shows weather-related outage, but it sure seems like they should be up by now."
"77066 - W. Richey/Bammel N. Houston - Sunday 7/14 1:40 PM - [Here's part of the problem.](https://i.imgur.com/Nj67JQP.jpg)

Pole down since the storm, looks relatively straightforward.  No trees, very accessible.  

Feeds buried lines, probably for several subdivisions and intersections.  Lights still out at that intersection and most nearby."
Two of my relatives in 77088 have power now
77007 near Yale and 6th got power at about 2:20pm today. Centerpoint account still incorrectly says power is off.
"77386, Spring - Back of Imperial Oaks (a bunch of streets called “Estates”). Power Restored as of 5 minutes ago. Giving it a bit to see if it’ll go off again, but we’re very happy!"
My internet was somehow restored before my power 😅
Still no power in Kingwood
"Power was projected to be back on for my area on 16Jul2024, however, power was restored last evening on 14Jul2024. Centerpoint’s power outage map still shows my area as pending to have power restored by 16Jul2024. The power outage map cannot be relied on completely. 

To all those that remain without power, my thoughts are with you, and hopefully you are restored soon and before your projected restoration date"
77086 - 249 & Beltway 8 Power restored at 11:30.

Entergy Texas Hurricane Beryl Alert

Tuesday, July 16, 2024 – 9:30 a.m.

TEXAS

Nearly all customers restored after Hurricane Beryl caused widespread outages across Southeast Texas 

As of 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, approximately 248,000 of the 252,460 customers have been restored. The remaining customers who can safely take power are expected to be restored today.

Customers still experiencing an outage are encouraged to safely check for damage to the electrical equipment attached to their home or business. Entergy Texas cannot restore power to a location with a damaged meter base, conduit or weather head (the metal pipe extending upward from the structure with electrical cables inside). These items must be repaired by a qualified electrician before workers can start the restoration process. Entergy’s Storm Center provides a list of the electrical equipment the company will repair, and the equipment customers are responsible for repairing.  https://www.entergynewsroom.com/storm-center/weatherhead/

As crews continue to clear debris and restore power in hard-hit areas, customers are encouraged to visit Entergy’s View Outage map or sign up for outage alerts to receive real-time restoration updates. Entergy Texas will continue working around the clock until every customer impacted by Hurricane Beryl is restored."
1:30p Power back on in 77092 - Watonga and 43rd. 15 days out this year.
My mom in Humble 77396 just had electricity turn on minutes ago! Happened just a few hours after internet came back on.
I'm in 77057. Power out since Fri night. just turned back on. Fountain View.
"I mainly dislike the lies. I was given two different repair times. Then I was told it had been fixed. It had not. Confirmed with neighbors. I had to call it in again. Now they admit it hasn't been fixed. Duh.

I can handle adversity, but don't piss on me and tell me that it's raining, Centerpoint!"
Does Centerpoint work overnight or are we cooked for another day? Fuck this is demoralizing.
77584 power back on as of 20 minutes ago!
"77007 tc jester east and I10, no power since about 8am, there are a few streets in the zipcode that got their power but nothing for us. "
"77090 and 77073 still no power. 
If their latest ""map"" is to be trusted it's all ""assessment"" and no actual repair work has even started. Still haven't seen a single linesman or repair crew or even truck. 


At this point I'm treating everything Centerpoint says as lies, incompetence and PR BS. Very very angry, I hope they get what's due for being unprepared and ignoring issues.


State, City, county officials are all now playing the blaming game. Beyond pathetic. 
Nice start to a mayor's term /s"
"So the new map says that my entire area is totally energized, yet I'm looking out on a totally dark neighborhood. It's scheduled to be done by the end of today, so I think what they're doing is just putting anything that's scheduled to be done today as already done to pump their numbers up and make it look better."
"77066 (Klein) 11:00pm


Most of the surrounding area is lit back up, but there is an island of darkness around Bammel N Houston and Richey. I am in that darkness. It's like repair crews came and repaired everything else but my complex and the small subdivision behind it. Still have yet to see any trucks even look at the fallen utility pole at the corner of the intersection. They even got much of Greenwood Forest back online and there were trees down left and right in that area! Makes no sense. 


Other than that cell service is working as it should. 


More stores are open on 1960 and Veterans Memorial so don't have to go far and relives congestion when going out for supplies. 


Hang in there. CPs bullshit map keeps pushing the estimated date of restoration further and further back, currently says power to be restored Wednesday (17th)"

77088 still has no power
77089 Dixie farm and Blackhawk… still no power received a text at midnight that they would have a better timeline by “tomorrow” great way to create confusion because did they mean “today” or actually “tomorrow”. At the 71 hour mark without power.

77429 Huffmeister & Telge. Just got power back although some people in my small area don’t have it. Map says we wouldn’t get it back til the 12th.
Has anyone that has been in the light green gotten power? We are one of a few houses in our neighborhood without power and wondering if there’s any chance we will get it back sooner rather than later
Power restoration on my street is garbage. Half of the other side of my street got power a day ago. The other half of the street got power at 1PM today. The whole row on my side still has no power. ALL of the center point trucks left the area. So I'm about to get gas to try and run my generator another night.....
Are there any updates for 77060? The map hasn’t updated for that area at all and all around us seems to have power. I feel so ignored :(
77077 Energy Corridor - My modem on AT&T Smart home manager app is showing my modem back online again but I’m 2 hours away from home. Anybody in this area got power back?

My brother in 77064 just got power.

Editing to add: in case it wasn’t obvious, still don’t have power haha"
77063 still down 🥲
77064 - power as of 7pm

No power yet 77030 Cambridge and Holcombe intersection. Map doesn’t indicate estimated time. So tired.
77502 some blocks have power some don't. Mine seems sandwiched between two that do so I don't really understand how this is working tbh
77018 villas near stomping grounds - still no power
"77089, Sagemeadow along Blackhawk. After getting power for like 30 seconds last night, nothing else happened. Now on the outage map, it says expected power by the end of today, and I saw multiple electric trucks in my neighborhood, including one working on lines at the end of my street. I'm praying it'll actually be fixed today"
"77072 no power since Monday and it is Friday. All hope is lost. Been sleeping in heat, no good food, barely able to charge my phone. I'm already tired."
77088- Day 5 no power still. The outage map showed our area green with power restored but that’s not true. No one has power except some businesses.
Just got power back yesterday (77096) and this rain and thunder has my anxiety so high.
"77004- transformer blew Tuesday night…still without power. Management won’t help us and we’ve reported to centerpoint at least 10 times now. 
What the fuck."
77003 Between Webster and McGowan and I finally have power!
77042 near westpark Dr and briar park. Just heard a loud noise that heartbreakingly sounded like a transformer exploding.
77042 Woodchase and Westpark now have power in my complex!!!
77373 by Hirschfield I just got home and my powers back on. 
"77004, midtown, 288/McGowen

No power still. The map shows that my part is connected to the portion across 288 and is light green. The other portion right next to me is blue. Idk what that means in reality but I hope this gets fixed by the end of the weekend. 

I think we’re gonna cave and go stay at a friend’s house for the weekend."
77586 - my little block is the last holdout east of 146 in Seabrook.  Line crew said they have a few more spots my way left to hit tonight.  Fingers crossed.  I got a hotel room today so I figured once I spent the money we would see progress.
"77070, just north of Louetta/249 intersection. Just got confirmation that our power is back from our apartment office. Hope more of you in the same area also have good news soon!"
"Just got power back in 77583, five minutes after I finished changing the oil in my generator."
"77388 FM 2920/Bridgestone

Out since Monday 6:28am. I give up on ever getting power back."
Anyone that dealt with this in the derecho- will nested power outages be addressed after all of the circuits are complete…. After the 19th?
"77379 still no power since Monday early morning , the lines are still down in front of my neighborhood and 0 work has been done."
77459 still no power
"77066 - Hollister south of Bourgeois - Champions Point Village II - 5:42 AM Saturday, no power.  The corner store at Hollister & Bourgeois has power, as do the traffic lights.  

Centerpoint texted last night around 8:45 saying our area's expected restoral time is by end of day Sunday.  

Driving around our neighborhood, no obvious major problems.  Poles & wires are up, no trees across lines, etc.

Must be a hidden issue somewhere.  

Since they also gave that same time frame for my office over off Theall Rd. near Cutten, and it came up Thursday evening, I guess we can see a fair chance they'll get us up today.

I'm glad I have a generator but I should have set up natural gas for it.  Propane is $84 a day and wrestling 100 lb. cylinders isn't a fun way to spend time in the heat."
77069 Champions Green Apartments - Still no power. Map shows no estimated date for restoration. Really losing hope here…
77006 Missouri St. small pocket of houses still without power but the map says we are energized. I’ve reported the outage online several times. Is it worth calling and trying to talk to someone? Has anyone with a “nested” outage in an energized area had any lucky with calling CP?
77379 Spring Cypress road intersecting stubiner power back on.
77586 - Seabrook.  Looks like the final trees and branches are being cleared between Repsdorph and El Lago.  Some branches were on the lines behind Regatta Bay and Bar Harbor.  Hopefully this is it.  Just got the workers some bourbon as a thank you.  Tree crew all the way from West Virginia.
"77388 FM 2920/Bridgestone Ln

Power's back!!!!!!!!!"

77027 near the central market. Just got word my power is back! The estimated date they said was July 17th. So that map is completely useless.
"It's still much less detail than Entergy has been providing, but Centerpoint has finally started posting limited updates for their specific services areas, here: https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/Safety/Pages/Storm-updates.aspx?sa=ho&au=res"
"We were supposed to get power today, but it’s still out. 77056"
"77057 Woodway and Voss- well I’m disappointed honestly. Map says we were supposed to get power today, and the eight trucks outside our complex this afternoon were suggesting that too. Me and my neighbors were super excited by all the activity. And then the trucks moved down the street to do some more work. But now I’m winding down for another night on my sofa with my fan :/"
"77571, still no power on the backside of Shoreacres. Happy to hear that our neighborhood has started to get power again. God bless "

"77006, trucks spotted down Nevada and Ridgewood. 🙏"
77007 Durham and Floyd. No power and no water. Nothing since Monday morning.
Finally getting some attention near N. Braeswood and Academy. Several Centerpoint bucket trucks. Am in a fairly large nested outage in 77025.  Hopefully they can fix it tonight!
77373 (louetta/lexington) is on! Has been for about 25 minutes. Absolutely wonderful!

Received an email today it would be end of day on the 17th."
77035 no power

"77066 - Power restored Monday just before 3:30 PM.  But yesterday evening at 6:19 PM the power went off but only stayed off for about 2 minutes.  

Having seen posts from people who got power back, restocked fridges, then had it go back out for hours, I was really glad when that A/C kicked back in.  

Hoping for stability as we move ahead.

I checked the restoral map this morning and was surprised at how many areas still do not have power.

Lots of suffering going on."
"77406, power went off at 5:30ish, not back yet."
77062 powers been out for about 24 hours now.
77095. Have not seen a single Centerpoint truck when I was driving. What are they doing?! This is insanity they are so disorganized. Playing with peoples lives in this heat. They had time to prepare!
[deleted]
77006 Milam and McGowen power back on!
"You late on the huge bills they send you  they would shut off fast ,  your power is out so what. After this storm they most likely lose a lot of costumers, for there lack keeping people informed about power outages   My power is been off going on 3 day nothing from tnmp"
"77040 no power when we left around 7:00 pm. Currently charging stuff at a friend’s in the energy corridor where things seem mostly ok. I am losing my mind, anyone else? :)))) i’m not sure how much more of this i want to go through y’all."
"On CenterPoint's [Outage Tracker](https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/?_ga=2.223443356.64566939.1720578371-221761639.1720444979) page, they posted a link: 

""**July 10, 2024 - 8:30 p.m.**  -    [CenterPoint Energy provides customer restoration update](https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/about-us/news/1778)"". 

When I click on it, as of the time of this comment, all I see is a white page with the words: 

""The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable."" 

At this point the material is writing itself."
"This storm looks gnarly, def gonna delay restoration even more smh"
"77035 - Willowbend

Just got power back 5 min ago!"
Power restored in 77386!
"Anyone know how many people are still without power? I let a friend borrow a window AC and generator for his 87 yr old grandma that lives off Bingle and 290, and now he's not returning my calls. Wondering if he just wants to keep it and I got scammed fml"
"Keep getting told I have power when I don’t have power. I’m 100% sure they are keeping our power off on purpose. I had power for an hour or so the other day and then they shut it off. Line guys saying they were told not to turn the power on our side because they didn’t want to “overload” the system. That has never been an issue in the 5 years I’ve been here, during any outage. What the fuck is going on?"
Has anybody without power actually had it restored? There are vast areas in my neighborhood that are just completely pitch black. I know CenterPoint claims that they restored a million people and they're going to restore a million more by Wednesday where there will still be another million left without power but somehow I don't believe them.
Zip codes don’t mean shit. My in laws have had power since yesterday afternoon meanwhile we haven’t since 6am yesterday…. We live down the street from each other in the same zip code.
77095 no power and now no water. Third world country.
77022. We lost power right at 5am and got it back a tad before 6pm
"Y'all got back fast!! I'm glad to hear that some of y'all have your power back already, hopefully it'll be back within a couple of days. My job is closed tomorrow but fingers crossed it's back before the end of Tuesday

i can't really respond to every single comment but i really appreciate the updates, especially the one pointing out that more southern areas are being repaired first. i didn't think about that at all

UPDATE: It is 8:45 PM and the apartment complex across from us just got their lights back. 77057"
"77004 power has been out since like 5 in the morning yesterday iirc (and funnily enough, I didn’t have power problems during Harvey at all)."
Protip: the “we are working in your area” message on Entergy’s outage tracker site is a lie designed to placate you. Text them “STAT” to see real outage information and to know if they have started restoration in your area yet.
"77388 has partial power.  The crews come and turn on power all down the main roads for the businesses and schools but they dont take the 5 minutes to open and reset the transformer right next to where they already are for the neighborhoods.    Instead they leave and come back 3 days later to spend the 5 minutes to turn it on.  
Centerpoint needs to be fired.  I dont want to use them anymore.  

They are wasting more travel time then they need to which will add up causing more delays for everyone to get their power back on.  They should be going down the line of transformers instead of zig zagging around spending more time driving then fixing anything."
"Does stating your zip code matter? Because not all 77054 is without power. Can someone tell me what map y’all referring to when you say the map shows green !!!!. Never mind…here is the link for some one equally clueless ( scroll down to see the map)
https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195bcf03ae0c491f9f14bf77f2c43420
So I am in orange that means Centerpoint hasn’t even checked us , green is Ofcourse good, blue means - repair in progress. So …. What does it mean? Does it mean that we will get power later. Sorry for entitled questions , I have had two hours of sleep and I need to crack this code. What are areas that are not colored."
"My mom got a message from centerpoint saying to expect to be out of power for several days, 77011. But we know people in our zip code have power is this a generic message."
"last couple times I've refreshed the site, the # of customers restored has been going *down*."
"If Centerpoint has reached their magical “million” resorted power, then why does it seem that the MORE people are still complaining that they HAVE NO FREAKING POWER?!"

"Finally have power back in part of our subdivision in 77406. Four trucks out dealing with a tree that fell and ripped down power lines. They still have to deal with a broken utility pole and told a neighbor that would not happen until tomorrow. 

My stepmother is in West U and her neighbor spent hours on hold to get through to a person at CenterPoint who told her that they thought the area all had power when they do not. They had not even had anyone assessing their area. I have been over the help her every day this week since Tuesday and have not seen any power crews in the area but lots of damage."

"77521, Baytown, power has been out since Monday afternoon. 

It seems like they almost got me hooked up yesterday, then I heard a transformer explode somewhere. There's a downed line one house away from me and I haven't seen any crew or anyone even come look at it yet. 

My HOA forwarded a notice from CenterPoint that they expect to have about 50% of people back on by Wednesday afternoon, but that's at least 24 hours too long."

"77049 North Shore area. We got power back at 12:37 am. I was not able to report immediately because phone had no charge. This ordeal is finally making me resolve to do all the proper prep.  
Edit to add: What the fuck! The power went out again a few minutes ago. I’m hoping this is just the need for a quick little extra fix to make us all set up for good.  

 4:05 edit: still no power although other very near places do have it. Such a halfass storm and the city is crippled, library not open, short on bus drivers so many buses not running, gas lines everywhere. Spotty electric restoration. This is ridiculous!"

I just checked the Whataburger app and the Whataburger at Fondren and 59 in Sharpstown has power.  That's the closest in a few miles radius from here with power."

"does anyone know if CenterPoint is releasing phase powers? My office is up, but only the light stuff can turn on such as lights, small plugs. Not heavy duty items like AC or printers can turn on."
"Saw several trucks in the old Fudrucker's parking lot on Kirkwood at 59 in 77477, and a couple on 90 near BW8. About an hour later our old office's power came on. Our new office, also in 77477 and about a mile away from the old office, has no power but we're crossing our fingers."

"77584 west Pearland, received power back yesterday morning but now the power is out again once it started raining ugh"
"Had power since yesterday 9AM and it went out again about 15 minutes ago.   
Did receive a text from CenterPoint saying they've detected an interruption in service roundabout the same time.  
Also received a text from Xfinity about the same time that they have an outage.

Looking at other posts about losing power again, as well as xfinity and losing 5G service on my cellphone, all about the same time, makes me think that this is more widespread than something local to my area (which is next to Avalon Terrace in 77581)."
77002 midtown area still no power since 9am yesterday. We had power through the storm but then it suddenly turned off (maybe for repairs?) but it's been more than 24 hours now

1) i have filled the tube up. Plugged it and put it in the tank. Then release the outside end low to the ground. 


When i blow in the tube i get bubbles. I know it is in the liquid  


2) Built a water bong type syphon to no avail.  


I get a little piddle of fluid but it always stops. "

Got super excited and started cleaning and unplugging generator and after 20 minutes power shut off and has yet to come back. Shittypoint drove around for a little after and we thought they were working on it but they left around 7pm and have not been back. Lots of neighbors reported the outage again but shittypoint has not updated anyone"
Any word for 77098 off Buffalo Speedway? I'm starting to get really frustrated that everyone around us has power and it feels like we are a low priority being fewer people without power. I haven't seen any trucks or lineman.
77565 no power in all of Kemah.

77070 Lakewood Forest area power came on at 7 pm last night.  At 5 pm prior they flickered 3 times.  So if you get any flickering where you are I guess it means they are working on it.  I’m wishing you all get it very soon.

"77441 - updated map went from orange to dark green. Yet we do not have power on the entire block. Only the businesses facing 1093, which were restored the day after the storm."
77478 in brookside. They restored the line that was down in my backyard but did not restore power. Very concerned as this neighborhood has a lot of elderly folks. My mother’s house in 77479 new territory still does not have power. Apparently they were waiting to receive a part that they were missing. Here’s hoping these are all good signs lol
"77011 Lockwood and Navigation no eta for our building, says energized but we have partial power. Called rhythm they can't give an eta either I don't know what to do."

"Well, the side of the street opposite me has power, but nothing on my side. I’m in Oak Forest. 

An interesting twist from some folks on the opposite side they say they have wires down in their backyard, but Centerpoint has still electrified that side of the street. (it doesn’t quite sound right to me, but I’m getting this secondhand.) I could totally believe Centerpoint weaving a dangerous situation in place, and going ahead with starting up the power, just so it could improve its numbers. I wouldn’t have thought it works that way, but at this point, I wouldn’t put anything past Centerpoint."
"77070 on Hargrave right behind Houston Methodist Willowbrook off 249. No power. They assessed on Day 2, but I haven’t seen them come back.

"77571 - Power still out but Mom said she saw 3 Centerpoint trucks near my house. What that means I will see I guess.

Side note for those lucky enough to have a generator and window unit tape up your door jams with masking or duct tape and jam a towel under the door. You have to plan trips and it makes a hell of a noise when opening it but makes a huge difference.

Also the return in the ceiling was just raining down hot air into the room so I closed it, covered with a sheet of foil, and sealed with duct tape.

And all the seals around the windows where the unit is mounted to keep hot AC exhaust from coming back in.

The AC was doing it's best but needed some help, I hope this helps yours."
Any good news for 77373 around spring crossing?
77049 I’m out and there seems to be no sight of center point or workers

I think the power is back and my water is back, I surely hope people get their powerback, fuck centerpoint"
Still no power 77070 mist ln 😭😩
Power has been out at my house again for 9 hours now in 77441. For 4 hours CenterPoint claimed there wasn’t an issue and then at hour 4 send a message saying it’s planned maintenance and we can’t get any answers or updates as to when the power will be back.

Edit - Centerpoint map still shows us a ""Restoration Date Pending Review"". At least they added some restoration dates to the map, but this is ridiculous."
It so upsetting the surroundings area of my apartment in 77077 shows to be energized but not my side. Even the other apartments  across the street that belong to the same complex shows to to have power.
In what intervals is the outage map updated?
"77012 has nothing in our little blocks. I see power trucks on the north side of Harrisburg around 75th st but no guarantees that will do anything for us.

77061 at Monroe and Rockhill has some low voltage power. Can’t run an AC or power any appliances but lights and ceiling fans work and that is a huge relief."
"77086 got power like 30 min ago. For what it's worth, yesterday we had not ETA. And the new updated map had us under getting power by 15, and south section by 16. The south section got done earlier and now us. So if you want some hope they seem to be working really fast, couldn't ask for more badass linemen."
77063 south gessner/westheimer power back up and running. Good luck to everyone 🤘🏼
77024 chimney rock and i10 power was just restored as of 2 minutes ago

"Apparently my apartment in 77077 in the gentry side - Whittington area has got power. My sister got an email from management claiming to be a full power and my mom called a neighbor to confirm. Hopefully are lights stay on. We are probably going to go back in the morning.


There is hope people, our estimated date was Wednesday and we thought we would just be leeching off from our family friend."
anyone heard anything yet on meyer forest apartments on 77096(not lakeside but the other apartments)

"77018 - Ella and Lehman, still no power"
"77025 apt Complex on Buffalo Speedway. No power since Monday. CP came and fixed less than half the buildings and the rest of us have been getting conflicting reports on when the power will be fixed. Some agents say EOD everyday, some say no reports found, some say no technician has been assigned. There have been trucks in the area but they wont come help us. It’s more than 150 people without power and there have been some security incidents. I dont know if we are a nested outage and so just left to die in the heat.

Edit: Oh and we show as energized in the map"
"My corner of 77380 has power as of this morning. Our apartment sent out a text and I was able to verify through Xfinity today we are online and have devices connected to the gateway.

"77055 near Westview/Antoine -- just got power back around 2:15pm

Also feel like CP didn't know that my neighborhood was showing as ""energized"" when it really wasn't, they were surprised by it and power turned on a few hours later. Could be coincidence."
77076 near Parker and hardy power is finally back!
77096 we see the centerpoint truck over here but he keeps leaving and coming back. Praying for service today. We have ran out of food. Smh.

"77459, no power and now no water. It’s getting worse."
"77086 - I think CenterPoint is juking the power restored stats. I have periodically checked their website during the past couple of days. [Occasionally my meter reads that it is “powered on” on their website like in this screen grab.](https://imgur.com/a/kBbbXqC) Power was restored to some of my neighborhood except for the few streets close to my house. A benign, but bad for me scenario is that CenterPoint honestly believes that my power has been restored, so they are not going to send a repair crew."
"Got my estimate and its not until Saturday evening, oh boy. Thanks for literally nothing centerpoint."
"77042, bw8 and briar forest, power just came back!!! 🙌"
77598 still no power.  My neighbors across the street still have lights.  It's been 24 hours now.  I can't sleep.  I have a headache.  The weed isn't working man.
If Centerpoint cannot be trusted to provide updates then how in the world would anybody on Reddit have information? Centerpoint owns the infrastructure. Many (including myself) were out for two weeks with Ike.
"Minimum to marginal wind damage… Yet,  no power in Land of Suggs, 77498"
UPDATE 77070 Cypresswood: Power Restored to 3 buildings as of 9:30AM. CenterPoint vehicles are located at the end of the road. Hope for full restoration by the end of the day. 🙏

Bonus points: Centerpoint says our entire area is energized our Mayor says this is a lie. And that he has spoken to state officials who have assured him the legislature will hold Centerpoint accountable for their bungled response.

I am sure it will be the kind of investigation where they investigate themselves and find no wrong doing.

(My kid has his ACT there on Saturday. Prepping for it in the heat and dark has sucked, but still would like him to be able to actually take it instead of getting it pushed back from a mental prep POV. Very minor issue all things considered, I know, but he already had a huge last-minute delay with his AP Physics exam thanks to the derecho, so I feel for him with this! It's hard enough being a teenager.)"

"77586 - Seabrook / Repsdorph Rd area. Last night the city of el Lago told residents that centerpoint is going to come into their backyards to assess and fix damage to lines from fallen trees. For good reason—there’s an enormous fallen tree in some guys backyard by loch lake dr off Repsdorph that’s taken down the line that probably goes to us unlucky sods down the road. Centerpoint workers are nearby but are not actively working on clearing this debris, looks like they may have to take someone’s fence down to just get access to the line. Might be a while."

Entergy Texas Hurricane Beryl Alert

Sunday, July 14, 2024 – 9:30 a.m.

TEXAS

Crews restore power to more than 90% of customers by Hurricane Beryl

Entergy Texas crews continue working around the clock to restore power to our communities and have successfully restored power to more than 90% of customers impacted by Hurricane Beryl. As of 9:30 a.m. Sunday, approximately 231,400 of the 252,460 impacted customers have been restored.

Strong winds and heavy rainfall caused widespread vegetation-related damage to distribution lines, which is the main cause for extended outages. Restoration crews are using special equipment to reach hard-to-access areas and make repairs as quickly as possible.

The majority of remaining customers are expected to be restored before the end of the day Sunday, with customers in the most heavily damaged areas (Cleveland and New Caney networks) expected to be restored no later than Monday, July 15.

The chart below provides an update on expected restoration times in specific areas of our service territory. Keep in mind that these restoration times are estimates and times may change based on severity of damages and weather conditions.

7/14/2024 5pm

"So - I've been without power now for coming up on 3 days (420am Monday morning).  (I'm fortunate to have bought a generator and kept it running over the last few years).  I live in what is supposedly the hardest hit zip code in Brazoria County, the county where the storm made landfall.  

It makes sense to me that after a hurricane comes through, there will be some power outages and that some of those outages will take a while to be resolved.  

In my area, they've been working over the past 6 months at replacing wooden poles with metal ones, but they were nowhere near done.  I see a lot of people angry at Centerpoint for taking so long (and hey, I'm going to have a party of some sort when my AC comes back on) and Greg Abbott for being on a foreign trip during a crisis.  

My question is - has anyone seen analysis that shows that Centerpoint was especially bad at responding?  That political policy in Texas contributed to the current widespread outages?  I'm asking in good faith, I really don't know anything about how this infrastructure is managed.

Edit:  Yeesh.  Ask a question ..."
"We lost power and Internet for about 3 weeks after Hurricane Ike in 2008 , and that was only Category 2.  I'm thinking roughly at 2-3 weeks, give or take."

Why DOES THIS TOWN ACT LIKE EVERY STORM THAT HAPPENS IS ITS FIRST EVER STORM!??? Are they DUMB OR FUCKING STUPID
Is it getting any better for you guys down there? There is a lot of articles written about there still being issues. I saw center point or whoever said some would have to wait weeks for power?
"Probably an unpopular opinion -- but Centerpoints communication / online updates are far more improved than they were during the derecho. It's super frustrating for all, but given that Centerpoint is dealing with the biggest utility crisis in the USA at this time...I am cutting them some slack, not a lot, but some."
People relax- try 11 days with no power( hurricane harvey).You will be fine for a few days- you should have prepared for this outcome.
