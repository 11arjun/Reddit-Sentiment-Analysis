"Sally Talberg, the chair of the board of ercot, lives in Michigan?   The fuck? How could this even be happening."
"Maybe one day 77019 will get power.

Meanwhile, the girlfriend and I have started to shit in bags. The sound of dung hitting a plastic HEB sack in visceral.

I'm considering saving these and mailing them to our Governor."
"My dog and I are homeless and cannot find a hotel to stay at. Any person willing to rent me a room for a.week will be highly appreciated. I am on west houston.

Edit your likes have brought me warmth and even i freeze I will die a happy man. Just take good care of my dog.

Edit2: Good news guys, your good vibes and energy have helped me secure a place to stay now the power is back. Please, please, please, don't forget to show some love to the amazing people at the Waffle House on Westheimer and Willcrest (closest intersection). They went far and beyond  to help my dog and me get to a safe place. Some asshole broke one of their windows (presumably last night) and even with that they are all high spirited bringing their crews to work and getting ready to feed all the night owls out there. Tell them the Texas Reddit crowd  is with them too! They are doing take outs only for the moment and they might have a long line but is all about good people helping more good people to make of this earth the best way possible, even during dire.cirmcunstances.

Love to all, never give up, as the best is yet to come.

Love to /u/jellyfishjumpingmtn for thinking outside the box, please send.some gold his way. I cannot ask for anything else."
"You know I keep thinking ‚Äúthis is kind of nice. Here I am, snuggled with my husband and the dogs and the cats, listening to a podcast in the candle light, looking like a Thomas Kincaide painting...‚Äù

Then I remember that actually it fucking sucks."

"Do not, my friends, become addicted to water. It will take hold of you, and you will resent its absence!"
"Anyone else gonna miss the community on these megathreads?

Or would you rather have toilets and lights. 

Toilets and lights. Love yall but can't wait to cya. ‚úå"

"After 5 years on earth, my cat has finally discovered the warmth and wonder that is Underneath The Blankies. She has become demanding, leaving and entering as she pleases. If there is no available entrance, I receive a slap to the head/hand (whichever is visible)."

Anyone else more worried about lack of water? It will be normal Houston winter temps by Saturday but lack of running water for an extended period of time is a HUGE disaster
"Yeah, I‚Äôd like to sign up for these ‚Äúrolling blackouts‚Äù some of y‚Äôall are getting? Been off since Monday 1 pm. That‚Äôs 53 hours and counting with not even temporary restoration..."

"If your apartment complex is not allowing you to turn your heat on but you have electricity, it‚Äôs because they dont want to pay for power. This is illegal from what I understand."
People need to be in fucking jail for this.
"Top Gun Range is open as a warming center. 

We have hot coffee, WiFi and a warm place to sit and charge your phone."
I always thought there should be a ‚Äúfire everyone‚Äù button in the ballot box. This is one of those events that makes me wonder why it doesn‚Äôt exist.
I've never wanted a hot shower more than I do right now üò≠

The fact we‚Äôre on megathread V due to this incompetence is insane.
Must have some sort of PTSD from this experience. I kept waking up middle of the night with fear the power went out. Woke up this morning and still had power. Been on for 14 hours now. 77025
So this has been horrible. I would like power and water please. Will settle for one.
I miss the healthy relationship I had with my toilet before the snowpocalypse.
Feels weird today
60+ hours with no power. No water for about 30 hours now. Absolutely no timeline or answers. Where are these rolling blackouts? I am so over this.
"I know I'm just some random guy on the internet, but I have a buddy that works in emergency management for the City of Houston and he claims that they're going to try to bring a significant portion of non-functioning water supply back online today. 

So...you heard it here first, folks. Today might not suck as bad as yesterday."
[deleted]
The state and city government is lying about the water issue. My ass only 200k have water issues right now.
"They said Harvey was once in a generation. 
They said covid was once in a generation
Now they're saying this winter freeze is once in a generation. 
Not buying this once in a generation shit no more."
Up to 53% now! We might be able to hit 60 by tonight!
"**54 hours without power here.** I feel like most everyone is getting their power cycled on and off, where as I'm waiting for mine to come on since Monday. 77054."
"I've seen reports of people approaching centerpoint crews to question them. Please don't do that, let them work so they can get power back on"
Just realized that we could just use the pool water from the apartment complex to flush.
Ambulance just came to take my mom to the ER. No power since Monday. She hasn‚Äôt been able to do her nightly dialysis treatment. Can‚Äôt even put into words the amount of rage I feel towards the fuckers that caused this shitshow. It didn‚Äôt have to be like this but profits are more important than a working system.
Watching the Centerpoint percentage feels like election night
CenterPoint just stated that rotating outages are done for now
"I hope this damn freeze at least killed off a lot of mosquito larvae. We always hear about how our winters don‚Äôt get cold enough to kill a lot of the larvae. Okay biologists, here you go. Here‚Äôs a perfect cause and effect study for you to confirm your theory."
"80 1/2 hours and we just got power. Woke me up so fast from my bed in front of the fireplace. My husband and I dashed around to get everything plugged and charging in the event of potentially losing power tonight.

But, Kenny the whippet and company finally have some heat. Trying to heat it up so it‚Äôll be warm if/when we go Amish again.
Hoping the water comes back on so I can shower before work, but I‚Äôm a NICU nurse, so at least the babies aren‚Äôt too judgy about having a dirty nurse. They‚Äôre just mad at me for taking their temps and all the things.

Thank you to everyone who wanted to help us out. I hope everyone‚Äôs power comes on and stays on and we all can stay warm!

"Just a reminder, if you see someone in your zip code gaining or losing power and it isn't happening to you, don't worry. Zip codes are not a super reliable way to compare power grids since it is a postal designation and not how the grid is deployed"
"Chase bank charged me an overdraft while I didn‚Äôt have power to schedule a transfer... so I‚Äôm on a 30+ min wait phone call lol. And the first time I called they hung up on me :)

Edit: after 30 min I got through and they removed it for me! it was my first time asking for them to remove an overdraft but it‚Äôs worth a shot."

"70 hours without power and still nothing. How is this still happening?! I‚Äôm glad the outage tracker is reporting more people with power, but please please can we be next?!"
"XFINITY CUSTOMERS: You can get a $15 credit if you lost power on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. I was able to get a credit for Monday and Tuesday but not Wednesday, idk why. Here's the link

Edit: my bill is only $35.17 per month so I'm wondering if they are capping the credit at 2 days if your bill is only $35. Because essentially by claiming two days you get a month free. Just a thought."
Bought water at Phoenicia downtown and they charged individually per bottle even when I bought the dozen packs. Thought it would be cheaper to buy in bulk but it‚Äôs like buying bottles one at a time. A 12 bottle box of Topo Chico was 23 dollars! Isn‚Äôt this illegal?
What about the accusation that the outage is not about the inoperablilty in the cold weather but that power plants ‚Äúunplugged‚Äù because if not their profits would be impacted? Is this accurate?
Centerpoint still going up slowly at 53.5% I've gotta be honest I'm a little excited and trying so hard not to get my hopes up.

A friend has also said Xfinity is giving $15 credit a day for every day of lost service. Please check the website for more details. I'm not sure on how it's handled."
Pipe burst last night. What a fucking nightmare. My mom has covid and of course it was her room. Ceiling and wood floors are ruined. We got power back at 11 am tho (after around 35 hours). This is really shitty.

"Reports of city slowly restoring water pressure. Hopefully we at least get water back tonight:

It‚Äôs amazing how much happier I am when the power is on. I‚Äôm just terrified it‚Äôs gonna go off again
"Went 58 hrs without power. 8hrs with. And it just shut off again. Thankful for those 8hrs. We got 2 hot meals and we got to be warm for a bit. To those that haven‚Äôt had any power, I know it‚Äôs frustrating, I hope you get chosen soon."

"In 77030. No power since Monday 2am, with our water also going out shortly after, which puts us right around 62 hours of no power. 

We live in a society"
Is #FuckERCOT trending yet?
53.42% from Centerpoint. Keep in mind previous day was 49% around this time. Kinda happy that there is progress but sad it's so slow.
If power ends up coming on tonight then by god I am staying up until it turns back off. Then I can powernap through the outage like a big brain.
"Now that I'm back in the thread with power gone once again, just wanted to say thanks to all y'all for keeping me sane during these long outages. There doesn't seem to be any sense of fairness as to who's getting power and for how long, so I'm really hoping for some of y'all that haven't had any relief will get it soon. And now I wait for my 4G to deteriorate and the cold to creep back into my apartment. At least I got to take a shit with the lights on."
"Man, re-reading parts 2 and 3 of the mega thread is weird. What a wild ride this has been. 

Y'all deserve pats on the backs, a steak dinner, a large malt shake from Whataburger. This has been rough."
Received Centerpoint bill of 202k through email. Checked online with my account and it was the normal price!
"My SO lives in Australia, and apparently we're all over their news right now. This is absolutely insane."
"Supplies running low. I have begun luring squirrels with my nuts (pastachios) and have started attaching little harnesses on the squirrels. I am gathering them around me for warmth.

Using the pistachios was a difficult decision, as I am trading food for warmth. 

I am become the squirrel king."
"Hey this fucking sucks

Thx"
"Had a guy telling me that people are acting like entitled bitches for being unhappy during a power outage. ""We aren't owed electricity, stop being entitled"" 

That mindset is baffling lol"
How the fuck are we supposed to secede if we can't even handle a few days of 30 degree weather
"Just an FYI, the Hooters in Stafford is open and not very busy right now. Better than sitting in your car for an hour for Chick-fil-A."
God for the couple hours the power came on I felt like I was living like a king
Really enjoy having absolutely no clue whether the next outage (or innage) will be 20 minutes or 20 hours
Turner saying water pressure is back but I've got none.
Why is Houston taking such a brunt of the outages? Honestly ridiculous.
"Man all things aside, HUGE RESPECT for the people working in the power plants and all around to fix this issue, I'm out of words for them. God bless them!!"

Anyone else watching this disaster of a KHOU news broadcast? it‚Äôs giving me some much needed chuckles.
"This is why news companies hype up hurricanes lol idk why they get so much hate look what happens when they don't, all these people don't have water or anything to eat ready"
"ERCOT is currently showing 4GW of reserves; the threshold for conservation is 2.3GW.  What are they holding onto this power for?  Warmer weather?

EDIT:  Whoa.  Wholesale spot prices just collapsed statewide.  Down by a factor of 10.

EDIT2:  lol, fucking ERCOT.  It didn't go down at all, they just pushed the price into an RPA so everything on the map ""starts"" at $8,930 per MW and now the whole map shows as being $70/MW.  Fucking assholes."
Watching the Centerpoint map and seeing the numbers go up to getting my hopes up....I don't know if it's a good thing or bad thing
I can't do another night of no power. Please Centerpoint intern just give me a few hours so I don't lose my mind
"59.54% CenterPoint energy tracker.

"power ended up being out for 62.5 hours for me. happy to have it back for now and it's nice to have my apartment temp back in the 60's. got down to 39 in here. 

these threads have been a great source of info throughout this event."
In 30 minutes we‚Äôll hit 72 hours straight without even a flicker of power. Outage tracker being at 95% resolved is insane to me. Prioritizing the return of power to those who‚Äôve gone without it the longest was clearly a bunch of bullshit. I‚Äôm so tired of this.
It feels wrong having power. I feel wrong charging my shit and trying to get my house warmed up. What the actual fuck has the last 3 days without power done to me. I‚Äôve only plugged in the essentials for charging and put the heat to 62 and I still feel bad
"In case you didn't hear already, Ted Cruz and his wife have left Houston to fly to Cancun.

"77072. Finally after 52 hours, the power came back on! No idea how long it will be on but going to heat up the house while we can."
Note to self: buy more long sleeve clothing
anyone finding centerpoint outage map to be very wrong ?? showing me as having power ( I don't) and my friends (who do not) as having power
No water means restaurants aren‚Äôt really allowed to be open.  What are they cleaning things with? This is a goddamn disaster
"Under a million without power. Please give my dogs (Kenny the Whippet has hidden his sweaters) and cats and maybe my husband some heat tonight, Centerpoint."
I would like to yell at someone but all my reps voicemail boxes were full.
"62.57% from Centerpoint with under 900k without power now (897k).

"The ‚Äúwinter storm‚Äù that hit us on Monday is gone,  now it‚Äôs just another wet day in the 30‚Äôs that aren‚Äôt uncommon for even a Houston winter, the fact that we still don‚Äôt have power shows how fragile our infrastructure really is, people in state leadership should step down, this happened on their watch.  A screw up this big in any private sector job and you‚Äôd be fired I don‚Äôt think this should be any different."
"Center Point said they were rotating the blackouts to give people power intermittently rather than have no power at all, yet I was put on a planned blackout around 10:30pm yesterday, and it hasn‚Äôt turned back on despite their website showing the planned outage in my area stopped."
I would pay hundreds of dollars for my water back. I‚Äôd take no power if it gave me water. Ugh
53.93% from Centerpoint! A whole 5% increase over yesterday.
I just went off on some lady trying to cut a thirty car line at Cane's on Mason. Do people just believe rules don't apply to them?
"Holy fuck I willed it to existence. Power back at 77019. Time to charge my phone and heat up some soup. Thank you Centerpoint intern, I'm sorry for being mean"
"73.96% on Centerpoint with under 700k now! (688k)

And here I was praying for only 60%. 75% is possible tonight I think though."
Hour 76. No power. 77056.
"Life pro tip for the future: Next time you move, check to see if the home is on an emergency services electrical grid."

Honestly I just want somewhere to shit. I don‚Äôt want to risk not being able to flush and have it stuck in my house.
68% have power now! We might get to 70 tonight! Looking like tomorrow most people should have power. Just hope the water will be fixed tomorrow as well.
CenterPoint at 70.24% with power!

"59 hours without power. Should I continue to hold out for power at some point or make the move elsewhere? Or just consign myself to further days in the cold? 77077, I keep hearing about people in similar situations getting power which is keeping me going but it's never us."

> 5:37 p.m. ERCOT has notified CenterPoint Energy on Wednesday evening that there is now ""additional power generation capacity.""

> CenterPoint Energy officials said in an email that ""the company is prepared to re-energize portions of the electric system that have been without power.""

"so, the centerpoint energy tracker is showing almost 74% of customers with power. That is up about 20% from just this afternoon. Hopefully those with power can keep it and those without can get theirs back soon and this whole thing can end. It's been a trying half week but we are seeing light at the end of the tunnel."
"Currently at 75.27% from Centerpoint with 653k people without power. 

Half way to 100% from yesterday and less than half as many people without power today as yesterday. Keep your heads up."
"The power is currently on and the house is warm, but the water has come to a complete stop. It hasn't dipped below 32F tonight, so I seriously doubt the pipes froze. Do you think I should shutoff the water or wait?"
"If anyone else is still without power (like me, 72+ Hours), I‚Äôm told we fall into one of 3 categories: (1) large scale industrial facilities that voluntarily went offline to reduce load; (2) areas affected by ice storm damage/downed lines that need to be repaired; or (3) areas taken offline to shed load that cannot be reenergized without sending technicians to manually reenergize the lines.

I assume we‚Äôre mostly all in the 3rd category and won‚Äôt see power return until a bunch of centerpoint trucks are in our respective areas to manually do it?

 Not great..."
"Jumping in on the chorus of being desperate for a shower.

Something burst inside our attic on Tuesday morning. We came home from spending Monday night somewhere warm to a waterfall of warm water. Water is completely off because we couldn't get a plumber out here and whoever built our house made that part of the attic completely inaccessible. Better yet, it has a separate water shut-off we had no idea about that is completely different from the main shut-off. This is our first house, only second year in here, and now there's a new feature installed in our master bathroom ceiling where we get a fun view of roof from inside ü•≤ 

I can't forget the sound of our smoke alarm going off as water was pouring out of the ceiling and out of our house. If I'm just sitting here, I still hear it.

"This is really unbelievable...I went through Hurricane Sandy in NJ (moved back to Houston just in time for Harvey..) and we were without power for 3 days, but at least there was consistent communication not only from local and state govt but also mobilization from other states to help. What in the actual fuck is going on here? How has state govt not climbed up ERCOT‚Äôs ass about this? Why is our numbnuts governor on fucking FOX NEWS blaming renewables instead of demanding answers and solutions?! It feel like I live in fucking crazy town.

"77043 Royal Oaks checking in. Power restored just now. I know it probably won‚Äôt last, so we are charging anything and everything and I‚Äôm making hot coffee. 

Power went out Monday at 6pm. 

No water whatsoever.

My sister in law lives in Cypress and got hers yesterday around 10am. Hers has been off and on ever since. 

I‚Äôm enjoying this moment while I can cause I know it‚Äôs most likely not gonna last long.

It‚Äôs been depressing to say the least. Our state‚Äôs leadership (and I call it that loosely) needs to be held accountable for this bullshit. People have lost their lives due to this. Others (like my husband and I) can‚Äôt work, even remotely, due to lack of power and internet connection. So.... no money coming in. I‚Äôm sure this is the case for many of y‚Äôall too. 

This is a massive failure of epic proportions.

Dairy Ashford/Memorial - Randalls Looked to be open with line outside

Walgreens at Dairy Ashford and Memorial- Was open (this is where I went) - the line is indoors, but they only have juice and soda!

~~CVS at memorial and eldridge looked to be open but I skipped it~~

all the regular convenience stores and many other smaller places such as the kiosks at gas stations were all closed

2. OR you can open the tank and fill the water till the level indicated or till the water line and flush as normal."

"I just got out and drove around to see if I could find a store open to grab some snacks.  I can‚Äôt tell you how frustrating it is to see so many closed businesses with full on exterior lights, neon signs, and parking lots lit up.  And neighborhoods with power, that seems like every light on the house is on.  Seriously people, we are in an energy supply crisis.  If you aren‚Äôt in the room, can you shut off the lights? Does your porch light really need to be on right now?  I realize it‚Äôs not much, but it all adds up and could probably turn on a neighborhood or two and maybe even save a life. So much waste right now, it baffles me."
"‚ÄúThe best-case scenario is that outages will be reduced to no more than 30 minutes to an hour at a time later today or tomorrow, officials said during a phone call with reporters. But they said that‚Äôs unlikely based on weather forecasts and information they‚Äôre receiving from energy generators.‚Äù - the Houston Chronicle

They‚Äôre literally just saying anything to get off the phone with reporters. Yeah, the best case scenario is that we‚Äôre going to get the power working so well tonight it will actually go back in time and prevent anyone from being cold the past couple of days! Alternatively, the power will never work for the rest of our lives. But we‚Äôre keeping an open mind moving forward."

"ERCOT Q&A session live on channel 2 right now 

They‚Äôre saying that winterization standard are 100% voluntary. So there is zero regulation on this point for the private companies that supply Texas its power as it stands today.

Edit: completely dodged the question about why a 3rd of the board resides out of state

Edit 2: ERCOT did an assessment of its preparedness of winter power needs. They looked at what demand would have been for 2011 and adjust it for economic growth. Their models did not expect the amount of demand we have seen over the last few days (surprise!). No real input on where they went wrong. I‚Äôm sure that will be investigated at a later date. I‚Äôm not going to hold my breath for an honest answer. Call your state reps people. Demand answers. Real answers. Stay engaged and follow through otherwise this will just happen again.

Edit 3: additional follow up questions on why more wasn‚Äôt done to be prepared. They keep saying there is a national standard that was sent out to providers. But again that nothing was regulated. Small hint that might change by adding ‚Äúyet‚Äù to the end of their response. I think that is just a personal opinion of these two individuals.

Edit 4: they were asked what source of power is the one causing the biggest loss of power to our grid. They didn‚Äôt give a straight answer. Side note - ERCOT tweeted that it was Natural gas yesterday. I‚Äôll try to find that tweet later.

Edit 5: asked why windmills were not winterized and why it wasn‚Äôt mandatory and if there was a path to make it mandatory. Answer - ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù did not purchase the package to have windmills operational in extreme cold temps. They ‚Äúexpect‚Äù regulation to become mandatory. 

Edit 6: list of our system is designed to operate in hot temps during the summer so not a lot of building and protection from cold weather because that would cause overheating during the summer. 

Edit 7: No clear timetable on a return to power. They are trying to rotate more to help those without power for a long time. Just depends on the weather and our power generation facilities thawing out. Optimistic that will happen over the next few days.

Edit 8: last question - why should we trust ERCOT to lead us out of this situation. He said don‚Äôt have confidence in us, have confidence in the people out in the field (assuming the private power generator companies) to get us out of this.

Final Edit: Two official were answering the questions. One was The CEO Bill Magness, I can‚Äôt find the details on the second. KPRC will summarize the session on their website. They were pretty critical of the situation and some of their answer but please take anything they out on their website with a grain of salt. Again, demand answers from you Texas State Legislator reps. This is not a local government issue. The mayor and the city are powerless on this issue. Demand real answers and independent investigation by knowledgeable professionals. Good luck folks, stay warm!"

The Kroger at the corner of Gessner and Hammerly was open today. We got there around 3pm. Long line, but it moved quickly. By the time we reached the door, they told us they would be open for only 15 more minutes, no eggs, meat, or milk would be made available to anyone under any circumstances and only ONE water product per person. They are definitely trying to ration things. 

We got some Gatorade and a 2 gallon pack of water.
Fruit was fairly plentiful. They did have bread, chips, and soup. They also have power bars. I saw pasta sauce too (can make soup with it). They had some cheese as well. 

I would get there early tomorrow if you‚Äôre in the area, especially if you want milk, eggs, or meat or water. It will most likely continue to be rationed but it is there. 

I haven‚Äôt made it to either HEB yet (Bunker Hill at I-10 and the one off Gessner), but if any of you have and can give a report, I‚Äôd love to hear what‚Äôs going on there.

Whole neighborhood has power except 4 of us... I am one of the four. Day 3 and change here. Not enjoying this.

"As we cross the 80% threshold (according to centerpoint's website), just a reminder to everyone. If you get your power back refrain from blasting your heat at max. There might still be a risk that the system could get overwhelmed again. We're not through this yet, and we've made some progress. But keep in mind the other 20% who are still without power. Do it for them."

The Randall's on Holcombe at Buffalo Speedway is open. There was no more milk or eggs but there was a variety of meats and produce. Quite a bit of canned soups and vegetables. I didn't go down the bread aisle so I don't know about that. There was no line to get into the store and the parking lot was crowded for that store but still had spaces. The Chick fil A in that center had a line that looped and looped and looped around the lot by the Barnes and Noble. If you're going to the Randall's don't turn-in near the Chick fil A.

Drove past a work crew spraying a salt brine on the roads. Saw multiple fast food joints with lines WAY deep. no gas to be had anywhere, and we made it home with a touch of gas to spare. 

I just cannot believe that we live in Houston, in 2021, and this is an issue. It's not like a hurricane came through and destroyed infrastructure. I'm a pretty conservative leaning guy, and I hope that heads roll across the board.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

From one of our news reporters here in Houston. 

Wed, Feb 17, 2021 at 2:30am. 
Bad cell connection won't let me do a Facebook LIVE... so posting this for the latest info.

- As of 3:05pm Tuesday, CenterPoint Energy said they could not restore power to homes until more electricity is created. #ERCOT will not allow them to bring more customers back online. Centerpoint said customers without power should be prepared to have no power for several more days.

- These conditions in the electric industry mean we will likely start to see some retail electric providers (These are the companies you pay for electrcity.) go out of business. If your electric provider abruptly closes, you will be stuck with what's called the ""Provider of Last Resort (POLR)"" & a sky high electric rate of 25 to 30 cents a kilowatt.

 In an emergency meeting Monday, the Public Utility Council raised the price of wholesale electricity to $9000 a megawatt. That is what the retail electric providers pay to get it. You would pay about $9 a kilowatt. And if you are on a variable rate plan or your fixed rate contract expires and you go month to month... that is the rate you would be facing. That factors out to something like $450 a day for the average homeowner. Multiply $450 by 30... and that would be your electric bill for one month.

Some electric providers are telling customers to please leave... even offering $100 off their last electric bills to encourage customers to go somewhere else. This is because those companies didn't buy enough electricity to continue to give it to you for the price you agreed to pay. Basically, they ran out... and if they have to buy more now, the electricity will cost them $9000 a megawatt... but because you're under contract, they have to give it to you for pennies. Those businesses can't sustain that... and they will just go under. If you get an offer or warning from your electric company- take it.. switch now. You do not want to be stuck with a provider of last resort.

Right now on the Power to Choose website, there are only about 27 plans for Houstonians to choose from. Usually there are 100+ plans. If your contract is coming up soon, lock in a new one.

Yeah. It stinks. Prepare yourself ... and make sure you are locked in with a fixed rate. Even a high 15 cents a kilowatt right now is better than $9 a kilowatt."
"Wow, literally every grocery store, gas station, and pharmacy is closed right now inside the loop. Made it to Whole Foods in midtown right before closing and people are buying cans of sparkling water cause they‚Äôre so desperate. This is just awful."
"Holy crap. Centerpoint website says 94% area has power. It was around 45% Wednesday. Thats 133,000 without"
Cereal and no milk gang
My electric company charged me a late fee because I didn't/couldn't pay my bill on time...while my electricity was out. Nice.

"We stopped at Kroger off Morton Ranch/99 in Katy. We decided to wait in line because it was manageable (lol) with about 30-40 people. When we left it was probably up to 100.





No produce, deli, dairy, meat or frozen foods are available. They‚Äôre thrown away or cordoned off to be thrown away since they lost power.





No water. The only water they had were the single bottles of LifeWater, Evian, SmartWater etc. So we grabbed ten or so of those liters.





Paper products are just about out too. Not sure when they‚Äôre getting deliveries of new stock in but with the amount of people still out of power and people whose power has come on and they lost their food id imagine the rush at grocery stores will continue for awhile.





Also - fast food places that were open yesterday around this 99/529 area are now closed. With the exception of Popeyes on Clay (about 60 cars waiting)."

Does anyone know what to expect with natural gas bills once this is all over? I understand the price of it has skyrocketed which I expect will be passed on to the customer. I've been keeping alive with my gas fireplace running 24/7. Should I expect a $1000 gas bill later?

77083 - we back online after 2ish hours @10:51pm
[deleted]
"77007. Been coming on, staying on for 30 - 90 seconds, then power is gone again. Been happening intermittently over the last two hours. Lost power/water Tue ~9ish PM. 

Feels like the biggest cocktease ever."
Anyone been able to get water pressure back after not having it for a while?
77007 has power but no water
Has any statement been released about when water might one back online
"I'm in the heights  (77008) and my external water intake pipes cracked (despite insulation). I shut off the valve, but there is a minor leak drizzling out from the valve itself. No signs of internal damage, luckily -- but looks like someone may need to get into the wall to replace the pipes.

 I've tried calling / e-mailing 15+ plumbers but no luck so far. Looking for any help/advice."
"For those of you with burst pipes, what are your plumbers telling you as far as how long it's going to take to get fixed?

I called my usual plumber Tuesday morning and got on his list, but I just got an automated text from him that it could be as long as 3-4 weeks due to lack of supplies."
"77092.

57 hours ALMOST TO THE MINUTE and I officially have my power on! Keeping the thermostat low and instead using a heated blanket. Still no water. Stay strong y‚Äôall! We‚Äôre in this together!"
Man I feel bad for the strays out in Houston. Probably won‚Äôt ever see that cat family or mama and baby possum again.
Taking a warm shit in a lighted bathroom after drinking a hot cup of coffee.... Feels good man
"Does anyone else with power get nervous when you see a large amount of ""power back on in..."" comments here?

Like you know they're about to put you back on the chopping block."
Fuck ERCOT
Who the hell is downvoting a lot of comments in here that are about what zips have power and asking for food availability?
[deleted]
"Sucks ERCOT is a private entity controlling a public utility and they won't even share any info on how they intend to roll black outs and who will get power and when. 

Really fucking sucks.


I hope you all remember this bullshit in the midterms"
Are those of us w/ gas heat (I feel very fortunate right now to be clear) going to get a $10k bill when this is all sorted?
"Despite letting you go through the entire order process on Postmates and telling you that your order is ready for pickup, the Five Guys on Bay Area Blvd is not open. And they charge full price to ""cancel"" the order."
"I‚Äôm really worried my house is situated in some forgotten sector of the heights. I live in 77008 right by the high school and we have never, not once, at any point in time since we originally lost power on Monday at 5:45am, regained power. Not even momentarily. It seems like most everyone else has experienced some bouts of power? Has anyone else gone without the entire time? We‚Äôll be at 72 hours straight tomorrow morning. I feel like I‚Äôve been ejected from the grid altogether."

"Is it just me, or is the whole State Emergency Response plan when we have a weather emergency is just to tell people to ""Hunker Down"" and we will try to clean up the mess when it's over?

So I resorted to taking a shit off of my balcony because my water doesn‚Äôt work.
"77082. Power is out. AGAIN!! I can‚Äôt take this third world shit anymore man, it‚Äôs so ridiculous. Especially in the so called ‚Äúenergy capitol‚Äù of the world. 

Vote those fuckers who let Texas‚Äô grid get so bad out! 

Sorry needed to vent..."
"Also I'm planning to move to Houston TX this summer, can't wait to vote out those who are responsible for this calamity."
"I know this has been said but this is absolutely ridiculous. It‚Äôs raining and 34 degrees - this is NOT extreme weather. How was Texas not prepared for this?! I lived in NY/NJ for over 30 years and never lost power for more than an hour. 
I‚Äôve now been without power for 35 hours and without water for 18 hours."
Anyone got a list of those in charge of ERCOT? Who else is responsible?
"So I made this soup Sunday night. https://gfycat.com/physicalweeblueandgoldmackaw-lemon-garlic-chicken-orzo-soup-recipe

Admittedly, I didn't love the taste or the way it came out, but I stored it and ate an entire bowl on Monday. We have had on/off power for the last 24 hours and I heated a bowl on our gas stove for my grandmother in law. She refused to eat it. I tasted it and I am sure it's not spoiled, but sheesh lady this isn't the time to turn away hot meals...

Trying to keep my sanity"
Can't wait for the bottled FEMA water to arrive so we can all wait four hours in line for a 24 pack.
"Centerpoint up to 61.25% with 928k people still without power. 

ERCOT load is also up higher than it has been for the entire week that I'm aware of. 

Seems like they're actually gonna commit to what they said earlier today about getting more people power overnight."

"77008- no power for 40 hours but it came back last night and holding on for now. 

No water at all. 

Hungry and really wishing I could order food or go to a drive through- but going to eat another PB&J. No water to cook with is such a pain."
Anyone's attic water heater pipes freeze or burst?
77009 going on 56 hours no power. Neighbors directly across the street have had power twice in the same timespan. Absolutely over this. Got down to 38 in the house last night. Centerpoint is doing a piss poor job of allocation.
Can I use Gatorade to flush my toilet? That‚Äôs all I have and I don‚Äôt have water left. I‚Äôm in an apartment complex with no real snow to gather.
77450 power was just restore and water looks clear. I checked the readyharris.org map and I‚Äôm clear of a boil notice. Wow I feel like I won the lottery.
"Water turned off in 77056 this am.  I spent 2 hours driving around to several gas stations and minimarts in search of water and could only find small bottles here and there. It's a good thing I like seltzer water.

A lot of lost and confused-looking people wandering around looking for the same.  So dystopian."
47% have power not good enough but more are getting it back
"77077 power came back on at around 1 but still no water. Although I smell, I‚Äôm so thankful to be warm üëèüèº"
"77008 power back on, still no water. Not sure if rolling or not."
Anyone stick with Griddy? Would like to know what their prices look like.
Still no power in 77573. Going past 60 hours without it. But we managed to hook up our generator to our gas heater so we have heat now.
Anyone been to/from Dallas recently? I know it's supposed to get cold another night or two but do you think a drive to Dallas Friday afternoon would be doable?
"77081. Had power all day yesterday but water ran out around 9pm. Lights followed around 1. Turned on and off but officially haven‚Äôt had power since around 6am. 

Luckily I have half a tank of gas so I‚Äôve been spending a lot of time in my car at Walmart so I can at least have WiFi."
Zip 77008 power out again after being on for 14 hours. Still no water.
"In the past 48 hours I‚Äôve had power for 2, and it was in the middle of the night last night. 

Really getting cold and miserable."
Haven‚Äôt had power in 77042 since Monday about 2am. Water went out yesterday.

"So we‚Äôve had no power since Mon...the places across the street do. They turned off last night but are back on now, so I guess solidarity is short lived? I e hasn‚Äôt been used in the last year bc of the lockdown, and as it‚Äôs a government bldg paid for by my taxes, they wouldn‚Äôt mind me camping there, right? Since we‚Äôre fucking freezing and hungry across the street? I swear to fuck, everywhere I live is like only dark spot in a sea of light. I think the city hates me. I‚Äôm struggling to type with gloves on..fucking turn me on, people! üòâ I need electricity."

Power still out though, going on 24 hours."

77006 just got power!! We are at corner of Fargo and Hopkins. 24 hours off
No power since Sunday. Power came back on today at 3:30pm now gone again at 8:00pm. Those 4.5 hours were good enough I suppose.

If my pipes haven‚Äôt burst yet am I safe?
Well...we just lost power again in our ‚Äòhood off 99/529. It had been on almost 24hrs and went out about 30 minutes ago. What a shitshow.
So how long is this supposed to last?
"And just lost power again in 77098 after having it on for 7-ish hours. (Previously, it had been out 43 hours.) For reference, since not all zip codes are equally dark or lit up, we are near the Richmond and Shepherd intersection."
"77057. 56 hours no power, 10 hours on, 1 hour off, and just came back on right now. Is there a method to this madness?"
Seems like a lot of people are gaining power.. now water is the issue..

Power came back at 6pm but afraid it will go off again overnight. Does the 74ish% from cp mean permanent or temp service back?
"77057 - 56 hours off, 10 hours on, 1 hour off and now back again.  First time it came back, this morning, I had built a pillow fort and after falling asleep in it for an hour woke up with alarms going off and power back.  Now tonight I bring everything into the fort and as soon as I settle down power comes back.  The fates are conspiring to stop me from using it!!"
No power but I'm about to take a cold shower fuck this shit
"77007 near tc jester and i10. Just got power after 36 hours, feels amazing!"
77077. Back on after 24hrs. Hearing that Ercot is getting enough capacity online by tomorrow AM just to tell providers to start proper rolling blackouts. I hope that isn‚Äôt the case.
"Looks like Centerpoint is up 85%, it was around 70% at 2 in the evening."

Kenny is okay though since he has his new gummy bear toys. The other dogs are less amused at the lack of power and lack of wet food due to no power (minimize the dishes)."
Yay!!!  77019 power is back on!!!
"Ok, so CNP says 87.5% now. I assume if we don't have power (77081, 77498, and 77019) that we're just really unlucky?"

"We got water back for about five minutes, just a little dribble, now it's back off. Still, some progress!"
Got a trickle of water for the first time in two days here in 77011. The toilet is calling me!
"Guys that have a busted pipe, how are y'all getting water for toilets? I was collecting snow and runoff but my damn toilet demands so much water."
My apartment complex in 77019 has been out of power since Monday at 10 am. A transformer blew when power was restored to the complex and only some apartments are actually online. All other buildings around us have power

Ted Cruz can get bent. What a jackass
It‚Äôs time for the Governor & ERCOT to resign and gtfo of Texas! We need to be in the national grid fk this ‚ÄúTexas can be its own country bullshit‚Äù

Power at 77076 was back 2 hours ago and we could hear the neighborhood cheering all over the street. It went out again a minute ago.....
"I got a slogan ""Stay inside or freeze and die."""
"77077. Lost power in the middle of the night, not sure when exactly, still out now. Starting Sunday night, I started losing water pressure. It got worse and worse until last night, when it stopped working all together.

Pretty sure I have food poisoning too. Can't flush my shit or puke without going to the apartment complex pool, jumping the fence and scooping water out to dump it my toilet to get it to flush."

Anyone else still holding strong with no power since Sunday night/Monday morning? I‚Äôm beginning to feel left out of the rolling aspect of this so could use some confirmation that others have also turned to solid ice.
"If you ‚Äújust take snow, put it in your pot and turn the heat on,‚Äù said Wes Siler, a columnist with Outside magazine, ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to take forever and waste a bunch of fuel.‚Äù Mr. Siler, who demonstrated his technique on a small outdoor stove, said it was more effective to melt a small amount of snow first. Then, once that is boiling, add more snow.

This step will ‚Äúaccelerate the process of melting snow tenfold,‚Äù Marty Morissette, an outdoor enthusiast, has said. (He said it may be because water transfers heat more effectively.)"

77043 we had power from about 1-10am but it‚Äôs off again. I know it doesn‚Äôt need to be said but this is just so fucking miserable.
Did anybody else lose cell service? Metro in 77373 lost it for a couple hours this morning and even then now it‚Äôs just a very weak signal.
"77338 power went off and water came back on and our upstairs apartment neighbors pipes burst and it all  down on us. Hardly got any sleep inbetween waiting for it to stop and bringing the buckets outside in the freezing Temps. Had to use clothes and towels to keep stuff dry..luckily none of our stuff outside of that and food are messed up, will definitely have to be relocated though"
I never thought my body would get sore from cranking cold generators all day. Keep those carbs clean. Had to fix 3 yesterday.
Just lost power in the Heights- 77007
77098 coming up on 48 hours no power or water. Temp in the house is about to drop below 50 degrees. We might have to drive across town to find someone to shelter us. Wish me luck
77008 is still down but others in my zip and 77009 had power for a while. How are y‚Äôall doing? Hope my block didn‚Äôt miss the roll somehow

"Trying to find gas has been a sh!t show, finally got gas from a station I passed up the first time cause lines were long, went to other gas stations and people were trying to pump from empty pumps. Finally circled back to the first station, waited my turn and got gas. As I drove around for maybe something to eat, I passed by that first station and saw it closed, no cars at pumps anymore. This was around Voss/San Felipe. Maybe we need to start another  thread on open gas stations that still have gas."
FYI heard from a neighbor that Bucees in Katy doesn‚Äôt have gas.
Buc-ee's in Texas City has gas. About a 100 car line though.

Centerpoint tracker says reliability is at 95.48%. Looks like most people are getting their power back. [Centerpoint Tracker](http://gis.centerpointenergy.com/outagetracker/)
Definitely getting a generator. Between predator 9000w and generac 8000w(300 bucks more) I see a lot of good reviews for predator. Generac is a well known brand but that‚Äôs for whole house gens idk about portables. Either way probably won‚Äôt be in stock til summer most likely

"~~*expunged*~~

**Monday**- Had no power all day from 2am onwards.

**Tuesday**- Regained power about 4am, I think we kept it most of the day but I'm not sure since we were out getting things we needed and looking for a 30v adapter for a generator. Lost power sometime late tuesday night, maybe about 9pm. Thought they were finally rolling power since it was out for maybe 45 minutes, but it went out again at 12am but came back about 3-4am. 

**Wednesday**: Power went back out about 8am-ish, then came back on for *less than 5 minutes* (utter bullshit that is) at about 9:45am. Still off."

We live at an apartment complex, some buildings have been without power while other remained powered. Our building within the complex is across the street from the Washington fire station, and we believe this is why we have had power through most of the event."

"An interesting (if hard right slanted) [article](https://atomicinsights.com/south-texas-project-unit-1-tripped-at-0537-on-feb-15-2021/#:~:text=On%20Monday%2C%20Feb.%2015%2C,the%20feedwater%20pump%20to%20trip.) about the STP Unit 1 outage that cost us 1.2GW of electricity.

Don't really agree with the guy's conclusions, you don't run a reactor without feedwater pumps and a safety margin.  As bad as things are, a nuclear accident isn't going to make them better.

The last thing the industry needs is another disaster, as well.  Would've been great if there could've been more foresight in design (winterize pressure lines).  

But it's good to know there's no safety issue, and that the problem should be relatively easy to fix."

How did I survive the snow and freezing temps without power loss and then everything turn to shit days later. Water has been out for over a day now. Xfinity cut out before midnight last night. Cell signal is going through pound town trying to get any information.
77008 timbergrove/shady finally have power! RIP to my clownfish but I'm so happy to be warm.
So here‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt get. Why don‚Äôt they just cut off everyone‚Äôs power during the day and turn it back on at night when it gets colder. Most houses are insulated enough that they‚Äôll retain the heat produced overnight so that it will last throughout the day anyways right?

"I live next to Firestation 51 and I have **NEVER** heard the sirens go off as often as I have in the past few days. 

Maybe it‚Äôs because there is no power so it‚Äôs much more quiet but I have also heard that emergency calls have gone through the roof. 

Oh and they don‚Äôt always turn on the sirens immediately, they turn on lights first and sound the sirens later. So there‚Äôs a possibility that even the ones I can hear is not an accurate representation of how much they are working right now.

I'm not sure if I prefer that or knowing that it'll be out for hours at a time, because at this point I'm not sure what I'll have time to do when I have power. Do I have enough time to heat up soup? Make a pot of coffee? Charge stuff? Who knows.

77546 Friendswood. Lost power 6:00 PM on Monday. Got it back sometime in the morning on Wednesday. Lost it again around 3:30 PM. Came back again around 10:15 PM and it has been on for the last half hour or so. Fingers crossed it stays on for good
"77083 lights came back after 35 hrs at 7 pm, stayed on until 9 pm, went black again and now lights are back again at around 11 pm."

77057 near Galleria has had power for a while. Stay warm!
"77036 and we've been going pretty good on power at the moment (it's mostly been intermittent), though water pressure just gives us a trickle from fixtures.

>February 2011, gas shortages and low temperatures led to 30 GW of capacity being unavailable and load shedding. There were prior severe cold weather events in 1983, 1989, 2003, 2006, 2008, and 2010.

Deregulation also screwed [California in 2000 by Enron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron#California's_deregulation_and_subsequent_energy_crisis). The same thing is happening in Texas where the for profit power companies wanted to charge customers premium rates so some power plants were intentionally offline. 

>After passage of the deregulation law, California had a total of 38 Stage 3 rolling blackouts declared, until federal regulators intervened during June 2001.[58] These blackouts occurred as a result of a poorly designed market system that was manipulated by traders and marketers, as well as from poor state management and regulatory oversight. Subsequently, Enron traders were revealed as intentionally encouraging the removal of power from the market during California's energy crisis by encouraging suppliers to shut down plants to perform unnecessary maintenance, as documented in recordings made at the time.[59][60] These acts contributed to the need for rolling blackouts, which adversely affected many businesses dependent upon a reliable supply of electricity, and inconvenienced a large number of retail customers. This scattered supply increased the price, and Enron traders were thus able to sell power at premium prices, sometimes up to a factor of 20x its normal peak value."

"Just a reminder from someone who just made this mistake: check your faucet filters/aerators if you're having water pressure issues. Sometimes they twist off, sometimes you need a tool to get them off. There may be rust/sediment/idk pipe particles I'm not a plumber.

I only had full water pressure in one sink, the others would just give me a small trickle or just a few drops. I went to take a look at my meter thinking I had a leak and discovered that my meter wasn't registering any water being used. Scratched my head about it, but figured since I didn't have a leak I'd just deal with living with a single sink for now and call a plumber when things calmed down. Decided to do some of the housework that often falls at the bottom of my list and took the faucet filter thingy off to give it a deep clean and immediately realized the source of my water problems. Went and cleaned all the other faucet aerators and now my water pressure is normal in every room."

"I've got to say the actual 'rolling' blackouts are much more tolerable than the ""only power for Downtown and the literal Galleria mall, the plebs can freeze"" plan that Centerpoint was running on initially.  

Just goes to show, the shitshow could've been dramatically ameliorated with a tiny amount of forethought.

Which is why it's so important to remember this and jettison our current state officials in 2022.  Because it would not have taken billions to fix this problem - just a *little bit* of forethought and planning.

A good example of this was the Harvey recovery money the County got.  Ed Emmett and the Republicans decide to give the money to the wealthiest property owners - the more value you lost, the more you got (much like the wealthiest electric consumers got their service protected, initially).  When Lina took over, she change the formula to value the income of the property owner more - so that if your entire life savings was in a house, and you made 40k a year, you got more than you did if your summer home loss was 100% insured."

CNN had an article about prices spiking 10,000% for the distributors. [article](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/16/business/nightcap-texas-energy-mcdonalds-citibank/index.html)

I assume this is probably why the outages are so severe since they won‚Äôt make any profit on the fixed rates consumers have with them but if anyone has more info I‚Äôd like to know more about how this will effect us and if I should limit the energy use until things level out"
H-Mart and Great Wall supermarket in Asiatown are open and relatively well stocked

Just had the nerve wracking experience of trying to bring back water (cold water - hot water side has the busted pipe). Slowly you add pressure and run around the house looking for leaks. Chickened out when the busted pipe (that should have been isolated) started looking like it wanted to drip. Got a whole tub of piss smelling water. Then the kid was being ultra helpful and pulled the drain.

"Update from my post yesterday.

My sister apartment went out of power late Tuesday night, close to midnight. Woke up Wednesday morning...drove all around Westheimer looking for gas, because I had a 4th of tank. Found a gas station, got their too late. So my other sister was there too and she was worried about her house so I had to YOLO it back to Alvin...hoping that along the way I would find a gas station. Thankfully I did.

- Funny story...I used my debit card at the pump and I accidentally entered the wrong zip code and it declined me. So I went inside and used it there and it declined again. Luckily in December I got a credit card and it came in clutch for me...holy shit.

Sorry for the diversion. So full tank of gas, that was one less worry to stress about. My sister got him and things we fine with her house, no lights...but nothing to major. It's crazy because she's not on Reddit but she was worried about her house alot and after reading stories here, I can't imagine how bad it is for some people. So I had to get dressed and head to work, yes, I'm the HEB guy from last thread. I was glad to get there because that's where I can charge my phone. There was a person on here DMing me about them being able to pick me up and take me to work and I'm very thankful for the offer. It's threads like this and DMs like that were people show compassion and genuinely want to help people that reinforce that there are really good people in this world.

Anyways, so I'm back home...my sister has been without power since early Monday morning. Luckily it's not in the teens, degree wise...but it's still cold.

I hope everyone is of positive mind, it's hard because so many people are in trouble right now. I know I may sound like a shill...but HEB truly does care. Unfortunately we had to limit water, bread and some other items but we just want as many people as possible to have water. We may be out of items but many partners are coming in and helping in any way possible.

Also, I hope people don't forget this. Don't forget the people who made it where we weren't prepared for this. We may not get cold weather like this all the time but there's no excuse for us not to have atleast have something in place...maybe thats me being frustrated saying this...people have babies, elderly people...hell I can't even cook anything...shit been like this for 3 days for me...longer for others. This is not fine.

Sorry for the extremely long and exhausting post.

"So 77494 in Katy near Kingsland and 1463, no power since 9:30ish AM. Off and on power before that since 6pm last night(typically 2 hours on, 2-3 hours off) it's not drastic, nor ugh. I went to the store to check on water, most everybody is out of water around. I got some expensive Core water, and grabbed sparkling water. This was at HEB and Walgreens next to Katy Mills. Side note, Chic Fil A opened back up today there and the lines were the most ridiculous I've ever seen."

"77036, power went back on around 1am but water pressure is down to nothing. No flow at all from the bathroom sink or tub and only a trickle from the kitchen. If there are any broken pipes in the complex, management hasn't told us shit. I've got my stockpot out to gather rain water so we can flush the toilet. Can't use pool water because the pool is locked. 

HEB on Bissonnet (the one by Rice Ave) is open but a disaster. They didn't have the upper parking deck open and people were just parking wherever there was any free space. No milk, eggs, water, meat, paper goods. Employee said they were hoping to get a truck in the morning but no guarantees. 

There are a few open fast food places on Bellaire between Bissonnet and 59 - McDonald's and Popeye's were the ones I recall - but the lines are well out into the street."

And beyond that, this was like Christmas and Thanksgiving combined exponentially.  People *had* to come into close contact with each other this time to get warmth where they could, we may see a similar spike in infections over the next few weeks.

My intent is not to doom post,, but simply to say that everyone should be extra careful for the next few weeks.

We won't mention my debauchery, will we? 

While I've stayed faithful to the healthy food regimen I've been strong-armed into, the cravings for certain foods was too much.

Since she left my eating has been.. to certain extremes, luxurious and horrible.

"So I've been thinking about what form the regulatory response to the crisis should be and this is what I think:

The state should offer subsidies for several manufacturing facilities to be built in the state in each of three categories:  silicon solar PV fabrication (this helps our semiconductor industry, too, which is getting a big boost because of AMD and Samsung), battery manufacturing, and electrical inverter manufacturing.  The kind of subsidies I'm thinking of are large tax abatements, and then a credit per unit production (e.g., the Feds offered a 3 cent per KW subsidy for new nuclear plants, this plan could offer a similar subsidy per GW of solar panel/battery/Inverter-Amp production).  

The state should announce income-scaled subsidies for domestic solar and storage installation (so people making less than median income should get >50%, ideally 100% subsidies for installing such a system - the subsidies for storage v. generation would have to be separate and scale differently).  They should require utilities pay the prevailing retail rate at the meter for installed domestic power.  Offer additional credits if the company locates its headquarters here, as well.  

Estimated total cost:  $50-100B over 10-20 years.  This represents a maximum 10% increase in state tax burden (which is about 30% of your total tax burden, so 3% in additional taxes - much less (and potentially zero) if you tax the energy produced and recover it over time).  Different, less generous subsidies should be offered to landlords tied to the number of tenants they serve.  

This has several advantages:

1.  Helps local business.  You have to install the power here, the vast majority of the cost of solar installation is in labor and electrical equipment (batteries and inverters).  Local workers, local small business owners get this money.  
2.  Distributed generation makes the grid *very* resistant to outages.  Because there are now millions of points of failure instead of just a few, it is much harder to 'kill' the grid with a few bad occurrences.  
3.  Texas is ideally situated for solar.  Insolation in Texas is [among the highest levels](https://www.mrsolar.com/content/solar-insolation-maps/maps/solar-insolartion-map-usa.jpg) in the country.  
4.  Solar is solid-state (so no moving parts to break, fail, or freeze; a moderate amount of ice on panels actually increases efficiency so less worry about that).  
5.  Solar is zero fuel (so completely resistant to fuel price changes).  
6.  Solar has very low upkeep (panels are routinely sold with 20+ year warranties, and the only reason they aren't sold with longer warranties is because the technology hasn't been around long enough to prove the life of service).  
3.  As oil and gas production falls off globally, there is going to be more demand for it in industrial (non-energy) uses; moving to solar frees Texas up to become the one-stop global supplier for industrial O&G needs.  
7.  Distributed storage massively increases grid stability.  Day-to-day grid operations are much easier, because there is a huge well of storage ERCOT could tap into to levelize any loss.  Depending on how much storage is implemented, this could even extend to powering the entire grid for an extended period just off storage.  
8.  Making generation customer owned would be a massive economic boon to middle class homeowners, who instead of paying for electric would now potentially be getting a check from the grid operator.  
9.  Texas retains its title as 'energy capital of the world.'
10.  The Texas grid could actually remain independent of the rest of the country, because the storage capacity would act as 'backup generators' on top of the generation capacity.  Now, we shouldn't actually remain independent - we should connect with the rest of the country and be the good neighbors we should be.  But it's an option.  
10.  Republicans can recruit a new class of donors from the nascent solar business owners (and we all know this is the most important step).  
11.  The reality is that the O&G-based carbon-intensive generation is *going to be phased out* over the next 30 years.  Period.  Sorry O&G industry, hard truths.  This plan creates a solution to this coming carbon phaseout problem that also has the virtue of insulating us against future grid failures like that created today - and ensuring that unlike West Virginia, our state's job losses are offset by transferring them to a parallel field instead of stubbornly insisting that time go backwards.

Please support the ""Guns are good and so are Republicans, yay Christmas and freedom lobruls bad Trump forever"" energy plan."

"my hot water was working fine throughout this experience, typically with the same amount of pressure as the cold water. Today, however, the hot water completely disappeared. When I try to draw hot water nothing comes out of the faucet even though cold water comes out at a meager trickle. I have a gas hot water heater and Best I can tell it is functioning fine, however the line labeled hot is cold to the touch and the line labeled cold is warm making me think there is a blockage in the outbound line. I don't know what to do, or if maybe once the water pressure increases to its normal amount the blockage might clear itself, but it would be really nice to take a shower for the first time this week. Any advice is appreciated!"

"I have water coming out of my hose spigot at the front of the house, but the faucets inside are bone dry.

I am hoping this just means the pressure is way too low to get inside of the house?"

"For cigarette smokers and dippers, good idea to start keeping a box of cigars around in case you run out and stores/roads are closed. 

They can last years if properly stored. And they have much more nicotine than cigarettes. It gets absorbed even if you don't inhale.

Edit: Dont get the downvotes. Cigars might be too bourgeois for this sub."
"This is what happens when stupid fucking voters don't even know TRRC exists, much less what they do, including the incomptent commissioners we elect. It doesn't matter if it's Dem, Rep, this is what you get when you let corporations decide who regulates themselves. This is the fault of a stupid electorate, you had your chance in 2016, every newspaper in the state told you who the only candidate even qualified for the job was, but he came in third because he didn't have a D or R next to his name.

I swear, anyone in Texas who doesn't understand the power of the Lieutenant Governor or the role of the RRC shouldn't even be allowed to vote. I understand our education system is a joke, but its not like the electorate would care anyways until they have to actually earn their rights, and I consider that knowledge a pretty low bar."

My question is how long your power should be restored
"all you idiots looking for someone to blame.   this was a once in a lifetime event.   a good way to kill off renewable energy is to force it to be prepared for single digit weather in texas.  guess what geniuses,   if we have another weather event that is as rare as this one.  if from heat or cold we will have issues again.  i once lost power for 2 weeks up north during an ice storm.   same set of know nothings complained.  if the north east has 95+ temps in the summer they have blackouts.   take your politics somewhere else."
